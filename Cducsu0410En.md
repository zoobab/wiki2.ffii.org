## Synopsis

The Christian Democrats, largest group in the German federal parliament,
have joined forces with the other party groups
([liberals](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/fdp0405/ "wikilink"),
greens, part of social democrats) in a joint fight of the parliament
against the ministerial patent bureaucracy, similar to what we have seen
in the [ Netherlands](SwpatnlEn "wikilink").

The Christian Democrats in particular ask that the technical
contribution for which patent protection is sought must be one in the
field of applied natural science, and that there must not be any claims
that cover programs as such, as they find is the case in the Council\'s
article 5.

This marks a turn of the Christian democrats away from the line of their
EP shadow rapporteur [ Joachim
Wuermeling](SwpatjwuermelingEn "wikilink"), who in May had [ hailed the
Council line and attacked that of the
Parliament](Wuermeling040519En "wikilink").
