**The chairman:** I note that the resolution has been adopted with 71
against 69 votes.

*(note that our parliament has 150 members so the attendancy was very
high, probably due to some other, high-profile topic discussed the same
day)*

**Mrs. Gerkens (Socialist Party = far left wing socialists):** As the
State Secretary is among us and the resolution is adopted, I would like
to ask her to tell what sho plans to advise the cabinet (council of
ministers) to do with this resolution.

**The chairman (of the parliament):** I leave it to the state secretary
to decide whether she wants to and is able to answer to this question. I
see, that is the case. The word is with the State Secretary.

**State Secretary Van Gennip:** I will, of course, as it should be,
discuss the resolution in the cabinet. I promised the parliment (Kemer =
tweede kamer = lower house) this afternoon too tell the Luxemburg
presidency what should be done the coming weeks in my opinion. That was
my plan anyway. The parliament will not only be updated on the
developments in Brussels, but also on what I will do with the
resolution. The resolution says I will endeavour that certain events
will occur in a certain sequence. The parliament will hear about my
efforts.
