# Bendt Bendtsen Shows Contempt for Danish Parliament {#bendt_bendtsen_shows_contempt_for_danish_parliament}

*Press release from* Radikale Venstre, *March 9, 2005, by MEP Anders
Samuelsen*

In the Dutch parliament it was yesterday revealed that Vice Prime
Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Bendt Bendtsen did not live up
to the mandate he received from the Danish Parliament\'s EU Committee.
The EU Committee instructed Bendtsen to fight to have the issue of the
new EU rules for software patents re-opened for discussion at the
Council of Ministers meeting, but Bendtsen\'s Dutch colleague,
Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst, doesn\'t think that Bendtsen insisted.

Anders Samuelsen, MEP for *Radikale Venstre*, says:

\"Bendt Bendtsen has consistently claimed that he did his utmost to get
the issue re-opened. He claims that there was no support for his
request, but this is not correct, according to Dutch minister
Brinkhorst.

In the Dutch parliament Brinkhorst stressed several times yesterday,
that Bendt Bendtsen did not insist on having the item removed. If he
had, Brinkhorst would have supported Denmark. Brinkhorst says that
Bendtsen \"left the church before the singing\" - in other words,
Bendtsen didn\'t finish his job\"

Anders Samuelsen thinks that this should have consequences for Bendtsen:

\"This is an outright scandal that should have consequences for the
minister. Bendt Bendtsen\'s unwillingness to carry out his mission shows
contempt for the Danish Parliament, and can have dire consequences for
in particular smaller companies\' possibility to develop software. If
*Dansk Folkeparti* and the Social Democrats stand by their earlier
declarations, the minister is heading directly for a vote of no
confidence. If this doesn\'t lead to consequences, the Danish Parliament
has resigned its own authority and its chances of gaining control over
the minister.\"
