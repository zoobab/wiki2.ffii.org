Berlin 30 November

All Groups of the German Parliament (Bundestag) have approved a motion
that criticises the EU Council\'s Software Patent Agreement of May 18th
and calls for stronger limits on patentability in the spirit of the
European Parliament\'s Amendments of 2003-09-24.

The [initiative started with the
FDP](http://swpat.ffii.org/papiere/europarl0309/fdp0405/index.de.html "wikilink")
afterwards the CDU/CSU and SPD/Grüne both drafted [ their own
motions](Spdgruen0410De "wikilink") to generate an intergroup motion.

By the [motion no
15/4403](http://dip.bundestag.de/btd/15/044/1504403.pdf "wikilink")
([English
version](http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/docs/(EN)1504403.pdf "wikilink"))
the German !MPs position themselves clearly. They are raising their
voice against the [ Ministry of Justice\'s role in May
2004](ConsDe040518En "wikilink"), by which the German Ministry of
Justice generated a political agreement in the Council for a directive.
The council proposition is diametrically opposed to [the position of
European Parliament](http://swpat.ffii.org/log/03/plen0924/ "wikilink").
So far the Ministry of Justice which had praised its manoevre in the
council as negotiating success and that [ purged contrary expositions
from the minutes](Cons040707En "wikilink") did not change its postion.

Already in the [plenary debate on 21 Oct
2004](http://dip.bundestag.de/btp/15/15132.pdf "wikilink") the Bundestag
made clear what it expected from the Ministry of Justice on the European
level: an adoption of the European Parliament\'s position. The minister
preferred not the attend the debate. Although in the meanwhile the
representatives of the government coalition had tried smoothen the
critique of the BMJ diplomatically, the MPs insisted on keeping central
demands clear.

By the motion the Bundestag sends a strong signal to the German
government and to the Council of Ministers. The Bundestag also
strengthens the position of Spain, Italy, Poland, Austria and Belgium
against the Council Draft. Moreover the motion join the [Dutch
Parliament motion](http:NlMot040701En "wikilink") that asks its
government for retracting its support. The Ministry of Justice is noww
asked to follow the unanimous will of the Bundestag groups and to
improve the current council draft. Factually the currenct council drift
[does no longer have a qualified
majority](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/52778 "wikilink"). This
alone should make the council negotiate a new draft. With the its motion
the Bundestag gives constructive advice to the council how such a draft
could look like.
