*Various groups of the European Parliament have submitted amendment
proposals to the Legal Affairs Committee which, if adopted, would
reinstate the Parliament\'s decision of September 2003, thereby clearing
up the dogmatic mess created by the European Patent Office and
encouraging judges to exclude software solutions from patentability.*

## News & Chronology {#news_chronology}

-   2005-05-09 [EP publishes all amendments in original
    language](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/juri05/ "wikilink")
-   2005-05-04 Amendment submission deadline expires

Deadline for submission of amendments was 2005-05-03 18h. Currently FFII
is aware of the following sets of amendments:

-   Michel Rocard, PSE, FR, Parliament\'s rapporteur on the directive,
    [resubmitted most of the core amendments from the 1st
    reading](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/rocard05/ "wikilink")
-   Piia-Noora Kauppi, EPP, FI, shadow rapporteur for the European
    People\'s Party, [resubmitted a large part of the core amendments
    from the 1st reading and, in addition, some amendments with
    partically conflicting tendencies, reflecting the fact that Kauppi
    needs to take account conflicting pressures from within
    EPP](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/kauppi05/ "wikilink")
-   Greens [resubmitted core amendments of 1st
    reading](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/verd05/ "wikilink")
    which resemble Rocard\'s
-   NGL/GUE (left parties) submitted [FFII
    amendments](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/ "wikilink")
-   Two Polish !MEPs of the EPP group submitted amendments from FFII and
    similar ones of Polish origin
-   [ Manuel Medina Ortega](ManuelMedinaEn "wikilink") of Spanish
    Socialist Party has tabled mainly 1st reading amendments similar to
    those of Rocard, and some FFII amendments. This was not entirely
    expected, given Medina\'s fairly unclear or even pro-patent stances
    of the past.
-   [ Toine Manders](ToineMandersEn "wikilink") and [ Malcolm
    Harbour](SwpatharbourEn "wikilink") have tabled some hardcore
    pro-software-patent amendments, but in general FFII\'s expectation
    that new fake limits on patentability would appear was not
    fulfilled. It seems that, as far as feigning limitations, the
    Council\'s position already has reached an unsurpassable optimum.

### FFII\'s amendment analysis service {#ffiis_amendment_analysis_service}

FFII president [ Hartmut Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink") explains the
upcoming procedure:

\"The FFII is working with a group of patent examiners and legal experts
to provide [analysis and further
proposals](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/ "wikilink")
throughout the weeks of deliberation in the Legal Affairs Committee,
which will vote on the amendments in June, and in the Plenary, which
will vote on these and possibly further new amendments in early July.

Only amendments that win the support of a majority of component members
of the Parliament, i.e. at least 367 !MEPs, will be adopted. Every
absent MEP will be counted as pro-Council.\"

### Post Second Reading {#post_second_reading}

Hartmut Pilch explains further:

\"The Parliament\'s position will not become law, but rather will be the
basis for a further reading of the Council and, most likely, for
negotiations between the Council and the Parliament in a Conciliation
procedure, which may well end without a result, leading to the failure
of the directive project, if the Council continues to be dominated by
the ministerial bureacracy of the national patent offices. On the other
hand, if the Parliament fails to amend the Council\'s current proposal
under the harsh majority requirements, the Council\'s proposal will
become law, and the hunting season for enforcement of more than 30000
broad and trivial software patents granted by the European Patent Office
will begin in Europe.\"
