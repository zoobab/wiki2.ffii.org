*The Commission of the European Communities (CEC) says that there is an
\"economic majority\" in favor of software patents. This is what they
concluded from a consultation in 2000, where more than 90% of the
respondents were against, but those that were in favor were claimed to
have greater weight \"in terms of investments and jobs\". We try to show
that even this claim was wrong.*
