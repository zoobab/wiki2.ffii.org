## Synopsis

The US Trade Representative is an organ of the US government which is
dominated by the same interest that dominate big industry associations.
It works closely with these groups to deploy the power of the US
government to promote their agenda in foreign countries. The USTR has
consistently been pushing countries all over the world to allow
patentability of software, business methods, mathematics and genes.
