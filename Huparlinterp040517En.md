# Hungarian Government promises Opposition to Software Patents {#hungarian_government_promises_opposition_to_software_patents}

Today Imre Mécs (liberal MP) made an interpellation in the Hungarian
Parliament about software patents. Dr. György Csepeli, State Secretary
of the Informatics and Telecommunications Ministry, has said that they
are against software patents. He also stated that they want Hungarian
programmers to be software makers rather than serfs.

The Ministry of Prime Minister (which is another body within the
Hungarian government with competence on informatics) is known to hold
the same position on the issue.
