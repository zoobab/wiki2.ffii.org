# 2004-05-14 Government and Parties in Valencia Region against Software Patents {#government_and_parties_in_valencia_region_against_software_patents}

After yesterday\'s public support from Izquierda Unida (leftist party),
today we have a [ public declaration](Valencia040514Es "wikilink") of
the Regional Government of Valencia (Partido Popular, conservatives).
Valencia has a large program of use of libre software in secondary
education, and which is mainly focused by the impact of software patents
on software.

The note is very clear, stating that programs should not be patentable.
The note has been issued by Gonzalez-Pons, Conseller (minister) of
Education of the regional government.
