Dear Government, Dear Parliament Parties, Dear Members of European
Parliament!

In the name of Association of Hungarian Linux users, I ask you this way
to take steps in every conceiveable place against accepting the
directive on computer implemented inventions in its current form. Please
do so because inducing patentability of software either in open or
covert ways is not in the interest neither our country, nor the European
Union.

The events of the recent times have been proven that this directive
draft have a lot of spaces to improve. Not just the Hungarian IT
professionals, but also civil and political organisations of more
countries have, and expressed doubts concerning the quality of this
directive draft.

We are facing a historical opportunity. We might make this directive
better with our joint, work between us, IT professionals, and you,
politicians in the same way, as Neumann have made informatics better
with his work.

We believe that Hungary serves herself and Europa which has taken her in
best if she helps restaring the negotiations on the directive draft.
After that we should reach the goal of drafting a new directive which
makes properly protecting the computer implemented inventions possible,
an in the same time makes open or covert protecting of software patents
totally impossible.
