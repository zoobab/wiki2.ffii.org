# Council Working Document FAQ for Parliamentarians {#council_working_document_faq_for_parliamentarians}

## Purpose

-   provide a document that can be sent to !MEPs by our supporters and
    that will give an \"expert\" colleague like Malcolm Harbour some
    trouble when he tries to provide the non-expert colleague a template
    for responding

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Make !MEPs understand quickly what are the problems with the
    [Council Working Party\'s approach to software
    patents](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/ "wikilink"),
    how they can counter misinformation from Malcolm Harbour et al, and
    what they can do to defent parliamentary democracy and software
    innovation in Europe.
