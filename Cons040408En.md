# Help Blast out this PR {#help_blast_out_this_pr}

It has the highest potential impact of all PRs since last summer.

When sending to journalists, please also invite them to the [Press
Conference](http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/bxl04/press/ "wikilink"),
for which moreover some [ specific work](Bxl44PressEn "wikilink")
remains to be done.

    but will do some things, including cutting out chunks of this PR and
    rewriting german versions for specific german news channels, see
    [Cons040408FrainDe](Cons040408FrainDe "wikilink").
-   Alex Stohr has contacted some news channels, see below

    in the UK

## Translate

Translate the [editable source
text](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons0408/cons040408.en.txl "wikilink")
and send it to to mlhtimport at a2e de, see [translating
instructions](http://swpat.ffii.org/group/langtxt/ "wikilink").

Note that the original changed on 2004-04-09 at around 16:00 in some
places.

### Hints to Translators {#hints_to_translators}

-   check EU institution/law terminology such as \"directive\",
    \"presidency\", \"council\", \"amendment\"
-   phrases like \"no software patents \-- power to the Parliament\"
    were chosen under shortness constraints which vary from language to
    language, different ways of shortening a base meaning similar to
    \"all lawmaking power to elected legislators\" may have to be found
    in some languages.
-   names like \"Call for Action\" should be translated, but the
    original title should show up the first time it occurs in the body.
-   since several people may be translating at the same time, you should
    usually fetch the latest txl file from the net before translating,
    and send only those text chunks which you really modified, leaving
    the others behind hash marks (treated as comments, not inserted into
    the database)

### Status of various Language Versions {#status_of_various_language_versions}

see also that version\'s own addenda wiki

#### Finnish

-   Tapani has finished a Finnish version. see
    [Cons040408Fi](Cons040408Fi "wikilink")

#### German

-   alexander stohr at gmx de and dh at cantamen de say they have
    translated to german, a lot of problems are left, see also
    discussion on [Cons040408De](Cons040408De "wikilink")

#### Dutch

-   Discussion also in Dutch at [Cons040408Nl](Cons040408Nl "wikilink")
-   Reinout van Schouwen (reinout at cs DOT vu.nl) is working on it
-   Dieter Van Uytvanck as well (begin- #qjd)
-   Pieter Pax09 as well, beginning on part #Wew

#### Portoguese

-   Rui Miguel Seabra published it on
    <http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons0408/index.pt.html>, still needs
    some revision, mostly for spelling mistakes due to fast typing.
-   Discussion in Portugues at [Cons040408Pt](Cons040408Pt "wikilink")

### Spanish

-   Erik Josefsson got a spanish version trough IRC and now asked for a
    spanish translator trough traduk ML, supposed he wants to verify the
    text. see [Cons040408Es](Cons040408Es "wikilink"). We need the
    address and uid of this spanish translator. Translation is quite
    imperfect, needs proofreading by Jesus or Xavier.

Other languages are going silently online, please see web page.
