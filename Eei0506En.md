*A few days before the decisive vote in the European Parliament (EP) on
the software patents directive, the European Enterprise Institute (EEI)
is suddenly serving the patent lobby as a frontend. At previous
conferences of SME Union and FFII, EEI chairman Peter Jungen displayed
great communication skills and showed himself very critical of patent
lobby propaganda. However, the EEI now has published a crude propaganda
leaflet from a well-known corporate patent activist as an \"EEI
opinion\" on their website, alongside with an invitation to a patent
evangelism lunch meeting on June 27th.*

-   2005-06-11 [EEI opinion paper \"Why Europe Needs \'Software
    Patents\'\"](http://www.european-enterprise.org/public/docs/Software%20Patents1.pdf "wikilink")
    (written by [ Fredrik Egrelius](FredrikEgreliusEn "wikilink"), a
    patent lawyer who was hired by Scania with the task of promoting
    software patenting within the company, highlighted on EEI\'s
    homepage, marked as \"This publication is an EEI Opinion\", with a
    disclaimer \"This publication does not necessarily represent the
    belief of the EEI and all data, references and opinions should be
    attributed to accredited authors. The EEI does not take an
    institutional position on individual issues.\"). A rebuttal by an
    automotive technology SME can be found [
    here](Wuensche050615En "wikilink").
-   [EEI future
    events](http://www.european-enterprise.org/items/futureevents/ "wikilink"):
    contains a description of the planned patent lunch titled \"The
    Bigger Picture\".

The speakers at the lunch are

-   Jonathan Zuck of [ ACT](ActEn "wikilink") (a Microsoft proxy)
-   [ Keith Beresford](KeithBeresfordEn "wikilink") (author of a manual
    for patent lawyers on how to circumvent the European Patent
    Convention, also closely involved at the political level, e.g. in
    advisory circles of the UK Patent Office, which has been a driving
    force behind the proposed directive)
-   [ Kai Brandt](KaiBrandtDe "wikilink") (patent lawyer and patent
    activist of [ Siemens](SwpatsiemensEn "wikilink") who has spent much
    of the last 2 years spreading misinformation about the the
    [legislative proposals in
    question](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ "wikilink"),
    claiming e.g. that the Council\'s version prevents software patents
    whereas the EP version prevents patents on anything that use
    software)
-   Prof. András Vedres, president of Hungarian inventors\' association
    (\"inventors\" = patent applicants)

None of the speakers is likely to present anything but pro-patent belief
statements similar to those found in the EEI opinion paper.

Gunnar Hökmark (new MEP from EPP Sweden, co-chair of EEI) is scheduled
to draw \"political conclusions\" from these statements in a final
speech.

The \"Bigger Picture\" (title of the lunch session) is likely to be the
one which Kai Brandt usually paints: desktop computers account for only
2% of the overall computers in the world, all the others are
micro-controllers used in devices, and much of the innovation is
nowadays taking place in the programming of these micro-controllers, and
this work must be patentable.
