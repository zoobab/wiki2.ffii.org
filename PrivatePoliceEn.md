## Commentary

Public private partnerships against crime and terrorism at the EU level
implies a privatization of the police. We already see this in the IPRED
2 directive (framework art 4, see also the explanatory memorandum on
this article), where rightholders of \"intellectual property\" rights
like copyright and patents can assist the police, even in drawing
conclusions. What about neutrality of police investigation? What about
possible abuse?

And then, dataretention was meant for fighting terrorism. Now the music
and movie industries lobby to make the data available for tracking
downloaders too.

Add this together. Data meant for fighting terrorism can be used by
music and movie industries, who can assist the police, and IPRED 2 sets
drastic sentences on all \"intellectual property\" rights violations.
Clouds over Europe.
