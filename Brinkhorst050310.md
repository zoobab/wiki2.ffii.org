------------------------------------------------------------------------

[WebWereld](http://www.webwereld.nl/ "wikilink") reports that the
decision about softwarepatents has possibly been made beforehand.

The [article](http://www.webwereld.nl/nieuws/20998.phtml "wikilink")
quotes Brinkhorst:

*\"I can only guess about the motives Denmark had to make it clear,
before the [of the](start "wikilink") Council already, that it would not
insist on a B-item\"*

Which seems to originate from the [stenographic
report](http://www.tweedekamer.nl/images/stenogram3_tcm22-44906.doc "wikilink")
on the site of the Dutch Parliament about Tuesdays debate.

The interesting part however, is that it also mentions that the Ministry
of Economic affairs confirmed there has been a dinner:

*The Ministry of Economic affairs would not consider it strange if there
had been discussion beforehand. \"It is quite possible that in the
context of the dinner there has been a discussion, but I do not know\"
says spokesperson Paula de Jonge. She cannot say if Minister Brinkhorst
has taken part in it and does not want to check it. The spokesperson of
the Luxembourg Council President did not react to repeated request for
comments.*
