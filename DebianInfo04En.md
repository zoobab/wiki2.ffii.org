Software patents a problem for [OpenSource](OpenSource "wikilink")

```{=html}
</H2>
```
The new elected Eurepean parliament has to decide about the legalisation
of software patents for the EU, soon. These patents are used (in other
countries) from big companies for elimination of competition. The
legalisation of software patents will lead to the end of the development
of a lot of software projects (in particular
[OpenSource](OpenSource "wikilink") projects like Debian). There are
about 30.000 accorded European software patents (there is no legal basis
at the moment), that will give their owners monopol- and licenseclaims
through very trivial things like \"mouse clicks in online order forms\",
\"scrolling in windows\" etc.. Software developers have to pay license
fees for their own by one\'s own hand written code, that may violate
patents. This will make it impossible for little and medium sized
companies to develop new and innovative software. And of course it costs
a lot of time and money to check the patents to see if there are patent
violations in your self written code. This checking can be done by big
companies only.
