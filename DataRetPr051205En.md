*5 December 2005 (Brussels, Belgium) The EU is passing a \"Big Brother\"
law to track every electronic communication, warns the FFII, an
international information rights group based in Munich.*

\"Imagine a world in which the state follows everything you do. A world
where computers watch every step you make. A world in which privacy is
dead and the machines can track down every dissident in minutes. A world
ruled by unelected agencies, working hand-in-hand with powerful
commercial interests. A world in which citizens have no rights except to
consume. Science fiction? The Age of the Machines? No, this is Europe,
coming to you in 2006.\"

So warns Pieter Hintjens, president of the FFII. He says, \"the EU is
about to pass a directive to track every communication you make. This
law makes the old Soviet spy states look like amateurs.\"

He continues \"This law goes against our European traditions of civil
liberty. It appears to break Article 8 of the European Convention on
Human Rights. It will destroy small !ISPs and raise prices. To enforce
it, the EU will have to shut or monitor every cybercafe, web mail
access, and wifi hotspot. Such a regime would be more authoritarian even
than China. Even the US, after 9/11, does not have such oppressive laws.
The EU does not need this law: it is a bad law, pushed through without
respect for the democratic process.\"

Erik Josefsson of the FFII says: \"We are entering into an era of \'I
don\'t have time\' legislation. With the expanded competence of the
Commission (see consequences of the ECJ Judgement September 13, case
c-176/03 Commission v. Council), the underarmed and weakened Parliament
stands no chance to do its job properly. The \'sausage machine\' is far
too easy to abuse.\"

The Big Brother \"data retention directive\" makes Internet and
telephony providers record \"communications traffic data\" for up to
several years. These huge amounts of detailed personal data can be
easily leaked, stolen, and abused. The forces - mainly the UK
government - pushing the Big Brother law claim it will prevent
terrorism. The FFII does not accept this simplistic argument. The real
targets, it appears, are ordinary citizens, going about their daily
business.

The FFII president points out, \"almost everyone carries a mobile phone.
With this law, your mobile phone and web browser becomes Big Brother\'s
way of watching you. You will never be alone again. If you do not like
this idea, contact your MEP today, urgently, and explain why it worries
you. On 13 December 2005, personal privacy becomes history.\"
