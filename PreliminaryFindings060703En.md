# Preliminary Findings of the Consultation exclude FFII enterprises {#preliminary_findings_of_the_consultation_exclude_ffii_enterprises}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brussels, Belgium, 3th July 2006

The European Commission published on the 3th July 2006 the \"preliminary
findings\" which should be used as a first basis for the public hearing
on the 12th July.

Briefly, two major problems of methodology appear\...

-   The unintended SME panel constitued ad hoc by the European
    Commission (untransparent methodology)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The \"standard replies\" or \"pre-fabricated\" answers made by FFII
    and relayed by a thousand of entreprises not taken into account in
    the analysis of the \"preliminary findings\" by the European
    Commission (obscur methodology)

2515 replies

-   1493 original \"individual replies\"
-   \"Out of those, 1493 were original individual replies, including the
    664 replies from the SME Panel consultation tool explained below\".

## Where does this SME Panel come from? How it has been constitued? {#where_does_this_sme_panel_come_from_how_it_has_been_constitued}

[SME panel](http://wiki.ffii.org/SmePanelEn "wikilink")

-   The European Commission said\...

\"In parallel, an identical consultation was launched with European
SME\'s via a tool developed for that purpose by DG Enterprise.
Specialists from the Euro Info Centres conducted the survey based on the
consultation questionnaire and drew up local reports which were then
compiled into national reports sent to the Commission on 14 June. In
total, 664 SME\'s from 14 Member States and the two acceding countries,
representing a wide array of industrial sectors, participated in the
survey\".

Calling the Brussels Euro Info Centre to get more explanations on this
SME panel which the existence has only been knowning since the 3th July
2006\...

This SME Panel would have been constitued the 24th April 2006, that is
to say after the deadline of the public hearing (12th April 2006). This
ad hoc SME Panel would have been discretely constitued by the European
Commission to create an artificial representation of the
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and get legitimation at a grass roots level.

For the Brussels Euro Info Centre, the selected SMES would have been
constitued through a patent attorney client entreprises databasis. They
would have also been sent a specific questionary. That is to say, this
SME panel might be interested into more patents and of course easily
influenced by their patent attorney.

Searching on Euro Info centres website\...

Centre](http://www.eic.org.tr/Eng/duyuru_detay.aspx?ID=636 "wikilink")

The targeted [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") to constitue the panel are clearly
biaised in favour of the patent system.

\"The [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") which are targeted with the questionnaire
are:

\- Current patent holders

\- Those who hold a patentable invention but who, for a particular
reason have not sought the patent

\- SME\`s who have been sued by patent holders for patent infringement

\- Any other SME\`s who have had to deal with the patent system\"

With an artificially constitued SME panel clearly pro patents -
incorporated into the analysis and canno\'t be dissociated from the
\"normal\" [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") - the results of the analysis
canno\'t be objective.

As to the conclusion of the preliminary findings, there would two
different kind of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")\...

\- The micro entreprises that are \"anxious\" of patent system probably
because of their lack of competence to understand the advantages of the
\"patent system\".

\- The medium-sized entreprises that feel more \"comfortable\" with the
idea of a patent system.

-   1022 \"standard replies\"

-   The European Commission said\...

\"The remaining responses can be divided into groups of identical
\"pre-fabricated\" position papers submitted by members or sympathizers
of professionals (patent attorneys) or interest groups (open source)\".

The \"Open source & software developers community\" is said to constitue
24% of the total replies. However, only one speaker - Pieter Hintjens,
President of FFII, will represent these 24% at the public hearing on the
12 July 2006. The other speaker will speak mostly in favour of most
(software) patents.

## Then, the 1022 standard replies or \"pre-fabricated\" position papers seem to have been excluded from the analysis and not taking into account. {#then_the_1022_standard_replies_or_pre_fabricated_position_papers_seem_to_have_been_excluded_from_the_analysis_and_not_taking_into_account.}

\"The IT SME\'s and professionals (a submission prepared by the FFII was
endorsed by over a thousand respondents, counting corporate and
individual software developers, other IT professionals and academics
among them) \[\...\]\"

Indeed, they do not appear in the rest of the analysis as if they were
not valuable because of their \"standarded\" nature\" and though being a
little less than the half of the total answer.
