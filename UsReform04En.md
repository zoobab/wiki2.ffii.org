------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The emergence of non-producing entities which use patents to prey on
large companies such as Microsoft has prompted a movement of large
companies to impose a few procedural reforms in the US patent system,
designed specially to make it more difficult for (small) patent owners
to assert their rights, and to give more money to the USPTO. In 2004 the
proposals, which were channelled through Microsoft proxies such as BSA
and ACT, reached the US Congress. It remains to be seen whether the
patent lobby can control the subsequent discussion as well as it
controlled the proposals.*
