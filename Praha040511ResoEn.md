## Letter text (english translation) {#letter_text_english_translation}

Dear Members of Parliament,

We beg you to take urgent action before May 17/18 in order to avert
major damage from Czech citizens and industry.

Our country\'s representative in the EU Competitivity Council must
strongly support the European Parliament\'s proposal on the EU directive
2002/0047 COM on software patents and reject the counter-proposal of the
Irish Council Presidency.

You find our reasoning in the annexed resolution draft, which we urge
you to adopt in this or a similar way.
