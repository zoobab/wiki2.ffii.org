At its recent conference, the youth wing of the UK Liberal Democrats has
passed a
[resolution](http://www.hhlibdems.org.uk/ldys/policy/article/softwarepatents.php "wikilink")
which criticizes the Libdem members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
for voting in favour of software patents. The UK Libdems in the European
Parliament, led by Diana Wallis and Andrew Duff, had voted against the
party\'s previous policy papers and against their own public statements.
Instead they had followed the recommendations of Arlene
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") (MEP, UK Labour) and the UK Patent
Office. The Libdem Youth explains why it is important that this course
be corrected before the second reading in the European Parliament.

FFII UK has a documentation about the [Liberal
Democrats](http://www.ffii.org.uk/libdems.html "wikilink") and about the
[UK !MEPs](http://www.ffii.org.uk/uk_meps.html "wikilink") in general.

The voting behaviour of the Libdem [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") can also be
studied in our [analysis of the
vote](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/plen0309/vote/analysis.html "wikilink")
