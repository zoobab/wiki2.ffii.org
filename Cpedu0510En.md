------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The European Parliament has resisted a multi-million euro
misinformation and lobbying campaign by a group of multinational firms
and rejected an attempt by the united governmental patent bureaucracies
and the European Commission to impose patents on pure software and
business methods on the EU member states. It is now up to national
parliaments, national judges and citizens to organise further resistance
against the European Patent Organisation and the multinational
corporations standing behind it, so as to make sure their harmful and
unlawful patent granting practise will not be followed in the
jurisdictions of the member states. The undersigned describe the
problems and propose measures to address them.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problems

1.  The European Patent Office:

-   -   Software patents: the EPO has in recent years granted 30-50,000
        harmful patents on data processing rules against the letter and
        spirit of the written law and is persisting in this practise,
        based on case law created by the said office\'s Technical Boards
        of Appeal and followed by some, but not all, national courts.
    -   Role: The EPO\'s role as a unified executive, legislative and
        judicial body violates all principles of the separation of
        powers that have been the standard since the 18th century.
    -   Control: The supporters of the European Patent Office have tried
        several times to adapt the written law to reflect their new
        practise but each time failed due to lack of public support. Yet
        the harmful practise is continuing even without legislative
        support, and the EPO is promoting it more aggressively than
        ever.

1.  Legislation:

-   -   The EP\'s Role: The European Parliament has at several occasions
        proposed clarifications of patent law which would, if enacted,
        have effectively obliged the European Patent Office to exclude
        data processing rules from patentability, as intended by the law
        which is currently in force. However these proposals of
        Europe\'s only democratically elected legislature have been
        frustrated by unreasoned resistance from the Commission and the
        Council.
    -   Innovation Policy: There is a lack of coordination between
        patent and innovation policy, and conversely the mistake of
        equating the two is often made. However, innovation policy
        (considered vital but problematic in the Lisbon Strategy)
        encompasses much more, such as competition control and even more
        fundamentally, the creative management of creative potential.
        This frequently involves phenomena not yet understood by
        economists, such as creative commons, open source, etc. Blind
        extensions of rights and enforcement means, even in cases where
        no one at all in the field wants it (e.g. criminal sanctions for
        patent infringements) happen all too often.
    -   The Community Patent: The Community out-sources the granting of
        Community patents, giving an unaccountable non-Community
        organisation, the EPO, carte blanche. The EPO will be able to
        grant Community software patents. The Community Patent proposal
        as it stands makes the EPO\'s Board of Appeal the highest
        authority on the granting practice. The European Court of
        Justice will be the highest court in infringement / invalidity
        cases. Two separate legal systems are created, allowing
        different interpretations of the European Patent Convention. The
        Community patent comes with accession to the European Patent
        Convention, which will create a loophole: Community law can be
        made by an non-Community organisation, disregarding the
        Community\'s constituting treaties, bypassing the European
        Parliament. With its long retroactive liability, the Community
        patent makes legal extortion profitable.

1.  The draft Constitutional Treaty:

-   -   The draft Constitutional Treaty\'s unqualified statement that
        \"Intellectual property shall be protected\" is unprecedented.
        It has already been abused extensively by the Commission (in its
        justification for the IPRED family of directives) and completely
        misses the point that such exclusion rights generally are merely
        a means to an end as opposed to a fundamental right in
        themselves.
    -   The Treaty in itself, regardless of the final form and content,
        cannot bring more balance and democracy in the European Union\'s
        decision making process without substantive changes in the
        Commission and Council\'s behaviour and attitude.

## Solutions

-   Community Patent and EPO Governance: In order not to undermine the
    Constitution, to prevent Community law written by a non-Community
    organisation, the Community takes over the European Patent
    Organisation\'s legislative role. In order to prevent a Community
    software patent, the case law on software patents is excluded on
    accession to the European Patent Convention. A Community law on
    software patents is made before accession to the EPC. In order to
    prevent Community titles by a non-Community organisation, to prevent
    out-sourcing of patent policy, the European Patent Office is made a
    Community Innovation Agency. In order to prevent separate legal
    systems with its own interpretations of the European Patent
    Convention, the European Court of Justice is made the highest court
    on all patent cases, granting, infringement and invalidity of
    Community patents. In order to prevent making legal extortion
    profitable, there will be no retroactive liability. The EPO has to
    put the legislative powers wielded by its Administrative Council,
    which is controlled by patent bureaucrats, under direct democratic
    control (as also suggested Article III-176 of the draft
    Constitutional Treaty).
-   Software Patents: The European Parliament in its second reading of
    the software patents rallied around 21 compromise amendments, which
    clarified the current law and formed a solid basis for further
    discussions. These discussions must be continued both at the
    European and at the national level in order to further refine them,
    in response to the deafening silence from the Commission, Council
    and EPO regarding these solutions to failures of the patent system
    to deal with new subject matter.
-   Innovation Policy: Copyright has made the software field big, and
    remains (combined with trade secrets, licensing contracts, branding,
    first mover advantages, \...) the primary and preferred method of
    protection for software for all software creators. Potential
    benefits related to exclusion rights offered by software patents do
    not outweigh the threats posed by third-party patents, especially
    not for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"). They need to own and be able to
    sell what they write.
-   Draft Constitutional Treaty: The Treaty should include proper
    provisions for amending and revision, so controversial provisions
    such as the aforementioned \"Intellectual property shall be
    protected\" can still be improved later should the Treaty be
    adopted. If the Treaty is to lead to a further democratisation of
    the Union and tighten the gap between the European institutions and
    the people, it must be accompanied by a substantive mentality change
    in the Commission and the Council:
    -   -   Opinions of the [European Economic and Social
            Committee](http://eescopinions.esc.eu.int/EESCopinionDocument.aspx?identifier=ces\int\int145\ces1031-2002_ac.doc&language=EN "wikilink"),
            the [European Data Protection
            Supervisor](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/c_298/c_29820051129en00010012.pdf "wikilink"),
            the [Committee of
            Regions](http://coropinions.cor.eu.int/CORopinionDocument.aspx?identifier=cdr%5Ccommission6%5Cdossiers%5Ccom6-011%5Ccdr134-1999%5Ffin%5Fac.doc&language=EN "wikilink"),
            [consultations](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eukonsult00/index.en.html "wikilink"),
            [ordered
            studies](http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/juri/20020619/SoftwarePatent.pub.pdf "wikilink")
            and various other advisories must be honored instead of
            systematically ignored.
        -   Answers to Parliamentary questions must actually address the
            points raised by [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") instead of simply
            rehashing old and long refuted boilerplate statements (\"The
            European Patent Office does not grant software patents and
            is doing fine\", \"Of course the European Commission knows
            better how to interprete the European Charter of Fundamental
            Rights than the European Court of Human Rights\", \...)
        -   The speed of decision making and bureaucratic tradition must
            not take precedence over [ democratic legitimacy and the
            quality of legislation](LtrFfiiCons050308En "wikilink"), nor
            [over the public
            interest](http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/swpat/council20040423.html "wikilink")
            in having insight in the Council decision making process.

## Call to action {#call_to_action}

Therefore, the following signatories call on the following institutions
to take action:

-   European Commission
-   European Parliament
-   Ministers and Governements
-   National Parliaments
    -   -   To pass a resolution asking its governement to submit its
            policy positions on Patents (namely EPLA, Community Patent
            or other international patent policy) at least 6 months in
            advance before any meeting to a Parliamentary Committee, in
            order to define a position by the National Parliament.(see
            EP resolution on Transparency: \"Considers that it is of the
            utmost importance for national parliaments to be able to
            hold their governments and ministers to account; is of the
            opinion that this cannot be done effectively if it is
            unclear how ministers have acted and voted in the
            Council;\")
        -   To pass a resolution supporting the inclusion of the
            European Parliament in the administration committee of the
            European Patent Office. If the Government or the Commission
            does not support the democratic control of the European
            Patent System, do not sign any agreement which does not
            support this condition.
        -   To pass a resolution asking for the Council of 25 Ministers
            to make all meetings of the Working Group on Patents of the
            Council of the European Union fully accessible by the
            public, and not organised behind closed doors. The documents
            of the Council of the European Union related to Patent
            Policy should also be made public without any time delay.
-   Companies
-   Citizens
