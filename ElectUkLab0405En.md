-   \"IP expert\" [
    [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink")
    changeable - as rapporteur, entirely pro-Council, but more recently,
    criticising Council for ignoring Parliament and so on.
-   some !MEPs unhappy with !McCarthy, but as obedient to Westminster as
    !McCarthy herself
-   science & innovation minister [ Lord
    Sainsbury](DavidSainsburyEn "wikilink") may possibly be persuaded to
    support parliament wording on \"technical contribution\", taking a
    keen interest but very close to [ UK Patent
    Family](SwpatukEn "wikilink"), who blame all problems on a few rogue
    examiners
-   more tightly centralised party apparatus than in most other parties
-   pro-patent lobbying within European Socialist Group
-   [ David Taylor MP](DavidTaylorEn "wikilink") strongly criticised
    government\'s software patent policy in [ Commons 2004-06-07
    debate](UkParl040607En "wikilink").
