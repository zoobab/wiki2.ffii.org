The consultation paper and and consultation questions are based on
questionable assumptions, e.g.:

-   \"innovation\" is the magic salvation formula in face of pressure
    from \"low-cost economies\"
-   innovation must be driven and financed mainly by the private sector
-   the key is to make knowledge a tradable good
-   \"intellectual property\" is essential \-- and it is understood
    between the lines that this means \"patents\", although this word is
    never used.
-   an \"intellectual property culture\" must be propagated to all
    companies, i.e. the patent movement must expand further

It should be noted that this consultation exercise is not conducted by
the Commission\'s patent department (DG Markt) but by a department that
has been relatively open-minded about patents in the past. Unlike with
DG Markt consultations, the page points to a wide range of studies and
there may be more willingness to conduct a real consultation than at DG
Markt.
