Latest News: The second motion is adobted!

The agenda for the Dutch Parliament for tomorrow is public now:

-   [Agenda Dutch Parliament
    (Dutch)](http://www.tweedekamer.nl/vergaderingen/plenaire_vergaderingen/schema/index.jsp "wikilink")

It finally contains the item \"VAO software-octrooien.\". It is the
one-but-last item scheduled between 10:15 and 15:15, so the debate about
software patents will probably be held in the beginning of the
afternoon.

The last item is scheduled for 18:00 , after which a voting session will
be held. There will be 2 motions regarding software patents.

-   The first will ask the Minister to change his vote into \"reject\".
    This one will probably not make it.
-   The second one will ask the Minister to change his vote into
    \"abstain\". As it looks now, this will get a large majority.

But, of course the vote is tomorrow, so we\'ll have to keep our fingers
crossed.

For those of you that are online (which you probably are if you read
this), you can follow both the debate and the vote life:
