(full name: Johanna Boogerd-Quaak) Mrs. Boogerd is a MEP as part of a
combined European liberal coalition of VVD (conservative-liberals) and
D\'66 (social-liberals). She is an outspoken **opponent** of software
patents and is affiliated with D66, which makes her a fellow party
member of minister Brinkhorst (see above). This should enable her to
communicate with the minister easily and often.

She was unfortunately not re-elected in 2004.
