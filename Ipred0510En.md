# Activities concerning IP Rights Enforcement Directive (IPRED) {#activities_concerning_ip_rights_enforcement_directive_ipred}

-\> \[ \[Ipred2En\] \| [ Priorities](FfiiprojPriorEn "wikilink") \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The IPR Enforcement Directive part 1 was narrowly passed through the
European Parliament in early 2004, without criminal sanctions. Part 2
consists in these criminal sanctions and is being pushed by the
Commission in Autumn 2005. The idea of legislating across the board on
everything called \"intellectual property\" has been strongly
criticised, and there is a particular danger that abuses of such
property rights will be aggravated.*

-   take patents out e.g. bz wording art 3 like trips 61
-   no across the board IPR enforcement legislation
-   no criminal sanctions mandated by EU (illicit extension of
    competences)
-   de-harmonisation by directives based on abstract concepts instead of
    narrow concrete cases
