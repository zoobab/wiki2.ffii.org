The letter was delivered by Antonios Christofides to the Minister\'s
office, in the morning of 20/7/2004. The document delivered can be found
at <http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf> (in Greek, of
course). It was delivered together with a short cover letter. The people
responsible for the incoming documents said the Minister, Mr. Sioufas,
reads all of them and assigns them to others; they advised to call after
a week in order to learn which person it will have been assigned to.

In the evening of that same day, a press release was issued by the Greek
team. The Greek version of it is at
