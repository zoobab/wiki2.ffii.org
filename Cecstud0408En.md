-   Tender by DG Information Society
-   Study into effects of allowing patents claims for
    computer-implemented invention
-   Description/object of the contract: \"The Commission has proposed a
    directive (COM(2002) 92; (2002) 47 COD) which would provide a legal
    basis for the patenting of \'computer-implemented inventions\'. This
    directive has been widely debated and interpreted as a possible
    solution for the legal ambiguity and lack of certainty that
    surrounds the patenting of computer programs, until now excluded
    under the European Patent Convention, though, in practice, granted
    by both the European Patent Office and by some national patent
    offices. The main objective of this study is to set up an
    independent longitudinal survey to understand the effect of
    computer-implemented inventions on the software sector under a
    technical, economic and legal point of view.\"
-   Total quantity or scope: \"The maximum budget for this study is
    500000 EUR for a period of 36 months.\"
