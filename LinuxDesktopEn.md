# Patents

-   Here\'s [a
    list](http://hubble.physik.uni-konstanz.de/felix/linux-desktop.txt "wikilink")
    that I created when parsing some PR material. It was supposed to be
    for my personal notes, so it may be somewhat hard to read.
-   Pantent on the FAT file system (could be illustrated by a shell
    whose prompt shows \"/dos/letters>\" or similar) (Or any
    small-memory devices like [CompactFlash](CompactFlash "wikilink"),
    Digital Camera..)
-   [A list](http://gauss.bacon.su.se/indices/ "wikilink") of more than
    20,000 EPO Software Patents. They can be easily navigated by
    clicking on
    [keywords](http://gauss.bacon.su.se/indices/keyword "wikilink").

# Drafts

-   The Gimp related: CMYK patents (since the Gimp *does not* do it,
    maybe should be [ImageMagick](ImageMagick "wikilink") or one of the
    many apps linked to lib littlecms) \<- The new Gimp-Version does
    support CMYK, AFAIK
-   Maybe a video player, since MPEG (ie. xvid, ffmpeg, divx and others)
    has a patent on it
-   I heard (to be checked) that the two-side-window mode of a file
    browser (see \"view profile\"-\>\"windows commander\" in Konqueror)
    is patented
-   The screenshot is very large and messy, it should be possible to
    gather every elements with only 3 or 4 applications opened

Problem: We shall not create the impression thast certain projects of
the desktop are under threat. audio patents are for instance a treat to
all patent holder.

I think we shall better not use a Linux desktop with knwon programms.

There are many intresting patents on unvisible things: \"virtual
devices\" See more here: <http://gauss.bacon.su.se/indices/keyword/232/>
I thinkm this would be fun.
