# Questions to the Council about its \"Statement of Reasons\" {#questions_to_the_council_about_its_statement_of_reasons}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In December 2004, the Dutch Council Presidency provided a \"statement of
reasons\" to justify the \"Political Agreement\" on software patents of
May 2004. They say that the Parliament\'s substantial amendments were
rejected because they deviate from established patent office practise or
violate the [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") agreement. The objections are
unspecific and seem to rely on long-refuted reasoning. They raise more
questions than they answer. We try to collect these questions, hoping
that the responsible people can be confronted with them somehow.
