## Things to do for FFII {#things_to_do_for_ffii}

-   provide the leaflets/stickers
-   help provide means of arousing attention
    -   -   banners

`    * we have paid 500 eur for 10 banners in Brussels, but they are bulky and sending them elswhere is costly (UPS 150 eur/piece, normal mail ?cheaper? but slow)`

-   -   list places where such items can be produced decentrally
    -   list possible slogans

-   ensure that there is no problem with permits/police

-   reach out to supporters, enlist people using the
    [FeedbackEn](FeedbackEn "wikilink") script system, have someone
    instruct the volunteers who sign up

## Name of the Game {#name_of_the_game}

-   A well-established term for this kind of small-scale street action
    is \"vigil\" (german \"Mahnwache\"), known especially from the
    pacifist and environmentalist movements
-   \"Nanodemo\" sounds scientific, but upon closer look it means that
    we are so small that nobody will ever see us: 1,000,0000,000 times
    smaller than a normal demo, visible only with electron microscope.
    It is to be questioned why such a size should have any particular
    impact. Minidemo OTOH means that we are miniaturising in order to be
    more flexible.

## Doubts about minidemos {#doubts_about_minidemos}

[ Attempts in Berlin](MiniDemoBerlin0405De "wikilink") seem to have
shown that

1.  not many people are willing to spend as much time as needed to make
    minidemos successful
2.  those who are willing are mostly core activists whose time is better
    spent on the phone (tasks listed above).
3.  there are even concerns that minidemos give us the wrong public
    image.
4.  it may be more effective to raise the issues as a citizen at
    europarl elections question rounds
