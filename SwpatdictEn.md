This page will contain information about the implementation of a
dictionary of patent-related terms.

The idea is to help would-be translators of the FFII pages by providing
them with the right translation of particular phrases they are likely to
encounter on the FFII web site.

The database will be comprised of the following tables:

**lang**

1.  code
2.  name

**ref**

1.  id

**phrase**

1.  lang
2.  id
3.  text

**acronym**

1.  lang
2.  id
3.  text

**comment**

1.  lang
2.  id
3.  text

**lang**.code is the ISO 639 (2-letter) language code.
