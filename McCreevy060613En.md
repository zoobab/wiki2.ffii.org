### Written question by Ebner MEP {#written_question_by_ebner_mep}

Given the still unresolved issues surrounding the patentability of
computer-implemented inventions (software patents), the question arises
what the Commission will do next.

What future measures does the Commission propose to take in this area?

Is it true that, in spite of the European Parliaments clear rejection
on 6 July 2005, the Commission is still seeking a solution in line with
the rejected common position?

### Charlie [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink"), Member of the Commission {#charlie_mccreevy_member_of_the_commission}

In its vote of 6 July 2005, Parliament rejected the Council common
position on the directive on computer-implemented inventions, which
implies rejection of the proposed directive. As a result, there are no
Community legal texts which will regulate this issue. The vote and the
far-reaching debate which preceded it demonstrated that the time was not
ripe for a meaningful piece of legislation to be adopted on this issue.
Therefore, a new proposal dealing specifically with the patentability of
computer- implemented inventions would not be desirable. As a
consequence, the legal framework applicable to computer- implemented
inventions in Europe remains Article 52 of the European Patent
Convention, which excludes computer programs as such from patentability.
Earlier this year, the Commission\'s Directorate-General for the
Internal Market and Services launched a broad consultation of all
interested parties on the future patent policy in Europe, with a
particular focus on the structure of the European patent system. The
deadline for the consultation was 12 April 2006, and preliminary
findings will be discussed with stakeholders at the hearing in Brussels
on 12 July 2006. Consultation is intended to ensure that any further
possible action in the area of EU patents policy takes account of all
stakeholders\' needs without discrimination. Parliament will be duly
informed of the results of this consultation. One of the options
presented to stakeholders refers to the Commission\'s proposal for
Community patent regulation. The Commission would like to point out that
its possible adoption will not alter the substantive rules governing
patentability which are set out in the EPC and would not extend
patentability to software as such. Moreover, the new jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice would improve the safeguards against the grant
of patents in error to a computer program. Therefore, the Commission
does not intend to present a new proposal along the lines of the
rejected common position on CII.

### Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) {#michl_ebner_ppe_de}

Frau Präsidentin! Herr Kommissar, Ihre Antwort war kurz, aber
verständlich und klar. Danke dafür. Ich bin sehr positiv angetan davon,
wie breit Sie die Informationsaufnahme auslegen wollen, und auch von der
Transparenz. Zu einem Thema hätte ich noch gerne nähere Informationen
von Ihnen bekommen. Sie haben erklärt, dass das Europäische Parlament
informiert wird. Ich glaube, dass es in diesen Entscheidungsprozess wohl
auch miteingebunden werden soll, und aus diesem Grunde möchte ich
wissen, wie Sie sich das vorstellen.

### Charlie [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink"), Member of the Commission {#charlie_mccreevy_member_of_the_commission_1}

The European Parliament will also participate in this consultation. As I
said in my reply, we asked for a consultation on the whole area of
patents policy. The closing date for submissions was 12 April 2006.
There will be a hearing in Brussels on 12 July 2006. That will be a
consultation about the whole area of patent policy and does not
specifically refer to computer-implemented inventions. I said in the
debate leading up to the European Parliament vote that if the European
Parliament were to reject the proposal at that stage I would not bring
forward a further proposal in the area, so I shall not be bringing
forward a further proposal.

### Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE) {#piia_noora_kauppi_ppe_de}

I am very pleased to hear that, Commissioner. We made our position clear
last year when we blocked the common position, which would have codified
the EPO\'s disputable software patent practice. That was the right
decision, and your decision not to table a new proposal is also the
right one. I should like to ask a question regarding the more general
work regarding patent policy. We now have a lot of proposals on the
table, such as the Community patent, a European patent litigation
agreement and maybe even some suggestions for finally changing the EPC.
What do you think the procedure should be for this? Should Parliament
have codecision?

### Charlie [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink"), Member of the Commission {#charlie_mccreevy_member_of_the_commission_2}

As the honourable Member is aware, the proposal on the Community patent
has been stuck at a certain stage and we have been unable to make
progress. Therefore, at the end of last year I thought that, rather than
waiting for things to evolve, it was important to have a general
consultation as to how stakeholders felt we should move forward. As I
have said at committee meetings, it is still my intention to give the
Community patent one last try during my term of office. I will decide
when I think is the best time to get that done and give it my best
efforts at that time. I thought it was not good to leave things in
abeyance and that it would be better to have this consultation about
general patent policy, and that is what these consultations are about.
The question the honourable Member asked regarding codecision is a
matter for the Treaties. However, I personally favour codecision.

### Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE) {#carl_schlyter_vertsale}

Please, Commissioner, when we discuss this in the future, can we make
sure that the small enterprises are more involved than the first time
around. One of the reasons it was rejected was that many small
developers felt threatened by this legislation and the big lobby
organisations followed the big companies\' lines, which in most cases
are contrary to the good healthy development of alternatives because
they will be strangled by the patents of the big companies. So please
make sure they have their voices heard from the beginning next time. If
not, the next issue will be blocked the second time round.

### Charlie [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink"), Member of the Commission {#charlie_mccreevy_member_of_the_commission_3}

The Commission did in fact consult !SMEs on the last occasion, but I
will pass on your remarks to the next Commissioner. As I have repeatedly
said, I will not be going into this area in my time as Commissioner.
However, I will gladly leave it on file and it will be available for the
next Commissioner who takes over this responsibility.
