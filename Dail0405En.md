## Story on ENN {#story_on_enn}

A group of ICT industry lobbyists met the European Affairs Committee of
the Irish Parliament (Dail) on thursday 2004-05-06.

Now being [covered by
ENN](http://www.enn.ie/frontpage/news-9411102.html "wikilink").

The article quotes Brian Caulfield, [ Trinity Venture
Capital](TrinityVentureCapitalEn "wikilink") investment director and
chair of the [ ICT Ireland](IctIrelandEn "wikilink") subcommittee on
intellectual property management commending the Irish presidency and
claiming that the European Parliament\'s version of the directive would
\"result in a significant reduction in investment within the EU\".

\"The Irish government has been proactive and has created a compromise
text that eliminates the key amendments that could create a situation in
which existing patent portfolios are legally un-enforceable while also
protecting intellectual property\", added Caulfield.

As an opponent of Caulfield, the article cites Ciaran O\'Riordan and the
Free Software Foundation (who was not aware of the Parliament session).

## To research {#to_research}

-   Who is the \"Dail Committee\"? Who met them?

\"Dáil\" is Irish for \"parliament\" - a Dáil Committee is a very
generic term - the Irish government set up such committees to look into
legislative issues. We do not know who the group of companies are but
we\'ll try to find out.

From <http://www.oir.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1360> :

` "The Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on`\
`  European Affairs will meet at 9.30 a.m. in CR3, Leinster House.`

-   -   Agenda: Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals.\"

However the swpat directive doesn\'t seem to be on their published
agenda:

It could be worth telephoning the clerk of the committee to find out
just what is going on

-   <http://www.oir.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/Committees29thDail/europeanAffairsScrutiny.htm>

probably this is worth doing, to check the ground, before contacting the
!TDs (members of parliament) and senators directly.

Summary of an item which went out on the \"Morning Ireland\" programme
<http://www.rte.ie/business/2004/0506/mibusiness.html>

Trinity Venture Capital\'s investment director Brian Caulfield says
patents are the main mechanism used by high-tech companies to prevent
their inventions being copied or used without permission.

He says the directive was aimed at harmonising EU rules, but the
European Parliament passed some amendments in September which would make
it impossible to patent any software-related invention. Mr Caulfield
said he feared this would cost jobs by reducing investment in the
sector.

But he said he was happy with the Government\'s response so far. The
Government has prepared an alternative text which the industry is
supporting. He hopes this will be adopted.

## Government backed on dilution of IT patent law {#government_backed_on_dilution_of_it_patent_law}

MAJOR multinationals, venture capitalists and Irish IT companies
yesterday backed efforts by the government to roll-back a potentially
devastating EU information technology (IT) patent amendment.

The directive, on the protection by patents of computer-implemented
inventions, was originally intended to harmonise the way that national
patent laws deal with inventions using software, but the amendment would
not only make it more difficult to patent IT inventions but would
retrospectively scrap existing patent agreements.

The Irish EU Presidency has proposed an alternative, compromise text
that, while allowing harmonisation of EU patent laws, would maintain
intellectual property rights.

Brian Caulfield of Trinity Venture Capital said after an Oireachtas
Committee meeting that the new amendment would \"make it more or less
impossible to patent IT inventions and could have an extremely negative
effect on R&D investment in the sector\".

A spokesperson for multinational giant Hewlett Packard supported Mr
Caulfield\'s claims, saying \"We are very concerned that the EU is going
in the wrong direction.\"

Last night, Oireachtas Committee chairman Gay Mitchell said \"The
dramatic changes proposed have very serious implications for Ireland.\"
He said his committee would be supporting the government\'s compromise
proposal.
