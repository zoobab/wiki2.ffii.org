# Work in European Parliament after summer vacation {#work_in_european_parliament_after_summer_vacation}

-\> \[ [ priorities](FfiiprojPriorEn "wikilink") \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The European Parliament needs yet to pass a resolution expressing its
will on software patents. We need to thank the EP for its decision
against the directive. Also the EP is facing many more decisions on
which we can be of help in gathering expertise.*

-   ask !MEPs to repeat february\'s call for a directive which clearly
    excludes swpat
    -   -   do not allow twisting of this into a call for the community
            patent
        -   see [Florian Mueller
            call](http://euobserver.com/?sid=7&aid=19714 "wikilink")
        -   zoobab: ask GLU about what procedure
            [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") used for piracy resolution

`    * beside `[`rules`` ``39`` ``and`` ``45`](http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PROG=RULES-EP&L=EN&REF=TOC "wikilink")` ?`

-   [PowerToTheParliamentEn](PowerToTheParliamentEn "wikilink"): Power
    to the Parliament website
    -   -   prepare a better [ EP Thank You
            action](EmDank0507En "wikilink")
-   Wieland article in SME magazine
    -   -   <http://www.ffii.org/~zoobab/bh.udev.org/filez/swpat/Wieland0507De/Fax583909C18-0001.pdf>
-   [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") procedure was a book you sign at the
    entrance of the hemicycle\... when you reach MEP/2+1 signature it is
    a \"???\" from the EP.

## other directives {#other_directives}

-   [Ipred2En](Ipred2En "wikilink"): Note (arebenti): think about
    [IPRED2](IPRED2 "wikilink") which is currently as a sceleton draft
    in the pipeline and could be \"used\". Consider that
    [IPRED2](IPRED2 "wikilink") draft recitals also codify that Trips is
    executive within the EU. We need a quick response with an amendment
    proposal package to [IPRED2](IPRED2 "wikilink")
