*Madrid, 27 April 2005 \-- In a nation-wide event to take place at noon
today, students, teachers, and faculty-members across Spain will
participate in anti-software-patent demonstrations to be held at their
respective universities.*

Events such as conferences, information sessions, exhibitions and
petition signings have been held at the well over thirty participating
universities during the last weeks, building up to April 27. The goal of
today\'s demonstrations is to publicly display nonacceptance of the
Council directive, and request that the European Parliament either
re-amend the directive to keep software free from patentability as it
did in its first reading, or, as the only viable alternative, to reject
the directive in the second reading.

As Alberto Barrionuevo, FFII representative in Spain, points out,
\"Students want to make it highly explicit that they fear an adoption of
the Council\'s directive would allow for unlimited patentability of
software, inflicting significant harm on small- and medium-sized
enterprises. This in turn would lead to large losses of employment
opportunities in Europe, create unhealthy dependence on the largest
multinational corporations, and severely limit the incentives as well as
the opportunities for innovation.\"

The demonstrations are supported by large number of varied groups and
organizations including FFII, Proinnova, the national association of
computer science students (RITSI), the second largest of the national
trade unions (CC.OO.), the professional associations ATI and AI2, and
several others, including over thirty computer associations, research
groups, business associations, etc.

At each university a pre-written statement will be read out, with
Richard M. Stallman being the person doing so at Madrid Polytechnical
University (UPM). The full statement and list of organizations can be
found at <http://lucha.proinnova.org/>.
