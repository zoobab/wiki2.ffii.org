354 OC 224 + COR 1 (sv)

The Council approved the amendments contained in the European
Parliament\'s Opinion and decided to adopt the act as amended with the

Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community).

20\. Commission statement

\"The Commission considers that effective action against counterfeit and
piracy requires criminal sanctions for serious infringements which are
intentional and committed for commercial purposes. It also considers, in
line with Article 20 of its original proposal, that where necessary to
achieve a Community objective, such measures may be adopted under the
powers conferred for the purposes of achieving the aims set out in
Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Consequently, the Commission will examine the possibility to propose in
due course further measures providing for criminal sanctions in this
field.\" see [Ipred2En](Ipred2En "wikilink")
