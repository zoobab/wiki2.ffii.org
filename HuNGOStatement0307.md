STATEMENT

We happily welcome the decision of Danmark, according to which monday in
the Competitiveness Council of the European Union they will request for
substantive negotiations of the software patent directive (directive on
patentability of computer implemented inventions).

Besides other countries, the Hungarian government has also appended a
unilateral statement to the may 18 text of the directiva, urging for
better consideration of the interests of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink").

We ask the government to assist this goal with support of renegotiating
the directive in the Council as a B-item.
