In Italy the forces of the patent movement are weaker than in Germany or
UK. The most important stronghold seems to be the federation of
employers Confindustria with its \"Intellectual Property Committee\".
This group has intervened many times in favor of software patents but
did not have decisive influence on the government, even less so on the
Italian members of the European Parliament.
