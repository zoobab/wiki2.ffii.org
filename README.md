Backup of wiki.ffii.org
=======================

Lots of information from the FFII.org was available on its MoinMoin based wiki.

MoinMoin sucks badly, the goal is to recover it with simple pages in different formats:

* Markdown
* HTML
* Gemini

TODO
====

1. Remove directories not containing a directory named "revisions" (find ./ ???)
2. Find a tool to convert the MoinMoin syntax to Markdown, pandoc does not support it
