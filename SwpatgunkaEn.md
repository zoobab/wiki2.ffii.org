*The walls of ignorance and greed are thick but not impenetrable. Even
individual efforts can make a big difference. We try to tell you how to
go about.*

## Urgent work for FFII activists {#urgent_work_for_ffii_activists}

-   talk to EPP and ALDE [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"), make them talk to
    their colleagues, based on our [ EPP discussion
    paper](FfiiEpp0506En "wikilink"), translate this paper to more
    languages
-   organise a national group of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and experts to
    come to out [ Brussels conference](Konf050629En "wikilink") next
    week.
-   participate in the [Economic
    Majority](http://www.economic-majority.com "wikilink") multilevel
    marketing action which mvernon (Micha) et al have been trying to
    build up. Every FFII activist should collect at least one corporate
    testimony and one new corporate supporter per week and be an
    interface between those companies and the FFII. Ask em-testimony at
    ffii org for more detailed instructions and support.
