*FFII proposes a sequence of basic steps need to be undertaken if the
European Software Patent Directive is to get anywhere. The most basic
ones consist in reverting some deteriorations that were introduced by
the Council\'s Patent Policy Working Group during the last weeks and
months before the Political Agreement of 2004-05-18 and that turn this
version of the directive into the most uncompromisingly
pro-software-patent version that has ever been seen during the 10 years
of the directive-formulation process.*

## Current situation {#current_situation}

The processes in the Council and Commission are dominated by people from
the patent institutions who are prepared to kill the directive project.
They now see it as very unlikely that they can obtain a rubber stamp
from the European Parliament for a directive that allows their network
(national patent administrations, administrative council of the EPO,
Industrial Property Unit of the Commission, patent departments of large
corporations) to go on setting the rules as they please. In that case
they prefer to drive the project against the wall. Above all, they fear
being faced with discussions.

They have almost succeded in driving the directive against the wall by
means of a [ Political Agreement on a Common Position of the Commission
and Council, reached on 2004-05-18 by an (un)qualified
majority](Cons040518En "wikilink"). During nearly a year of delay due to
resistance in member states, the Council managed to avoid discussions on
substance. Finally it resorted to [ violations of procedural
rules](Eu0307En "wikilink") in order to declare its Uncommon Position
adopted.

It would now be appropriate for the European Parliament to do what the
Council and Commission are implicitely asking it to do: end the
directive project. The alternative would be to reinstate the position of
September 2003 and continue the fight, hoping to loosen the grip of the
patent institutions on the member state governments and the European
Commission.

Those member states who want to address the issues constructively will
have to distance themselves from the deception and discussion-sabotaging
tricks of their patent officials and start to open up for discussion,
step by step, in the following order.

## Steps out of the Council Deadlock {#steps_out_of_the_council_deadlock}

1.  Delete \"magical\" wordings, such as \"either as source code or
    object code\", that were inserted by Bolkestein into Art 4A in the
    last minute. Reason: Nobody wants patents on individual expressions
    or singular instances of programs. These insertions serve no
    regulatory purpose but rather impose an interpretation on Art 52 EPC
    which makes the law meaningless and, probably for that reason, is
    rejected by the German Federal Court and even by the EPO. Delete
    such wordings also from recitals where they occur. The directive
    should not reinterpret the EPC in a way that does not conform to the
    [normal rules of interpretation of
    law](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/epc52/exeg/ "wikilink").
2.  Delete Article 5(2). Reason: The double negations are deceptive.
    This article makes software on its own patentable. It is a
    fundamental principle of patentlaw that \"what is claimed must be
    what was invented\". If a \"program, characterised by \...\" is
    claimed, then nothing more than a program (as such) was invented. If
    an information structure can be a patentable invention, then there
    is no point in defining \"technical\" anymore. Even the European
    Commission refused program claims in its proposal of 2002. Putting
    them back in in 2003 was little more than a signal of
    unconstructiveness.
3.  Delete recital 17. This recital says that a right to interoperate
    can be secured only through antitrust procedings. This again removes
    room for negotiations and represents a deterioration of the
    directive in comparison to the Commission\'s version of 2002.
4.  Define \"technology\" as \"applied natural science\" and \"technical
    invention\" as \"solution of a problem by forces of nature\" or
    similar, as (insincerely) proposed also by the German delegation in
    its maneuver of May 2005. The !TRIPs treaty compels us to define
    these terms.
5.  Support Article 6a (interoperability privilege). This provision has
    received the support of all three committees of the European
    Parliament and the Plenary as well as the nearly the whole software
    industry, including large companies such as Sun Microsystems which
    normally let their patent departments formulate patent policies on
    their behalf.
6.  Discuss the other amendments of the European Parliament and give
    national parliaments a chance to participate in the discussion. Take
    the letter and spirit of the [ Amsterdam
    protocol](Parlprot0408En "wikilink") seriously.
