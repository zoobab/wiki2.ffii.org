*Peter Jungen heads the European Enterprise Institute, a think tank in
Brussels which, after Jungen had shown a critical attitude toward patent
lobby propaganda, suddenly became a PR frontend for the patent lobby in
June 2005, shortly before the Parliament\'s decision on the software
patent directive. Jungen is currently campaigning to become the next
president of the SME Union. Previously Jungen held leading posts in
Business Angels Network Deutschland (BAND) and the German Employers\'
Confederation BDI.*
