Definitions of the term \"Open Standards\" have some legal significance.
Currently debates are going on about how this term should be defined.
The claim that a \"standard\" is \"open\" implies fulfilment of more
requirements in the context of the Internet than in the context of
specialised technologies created by traditional industry consortia. One
of the new and much-debated requirements is that an open standard must
be unencumbered by patent royalties. This has been incorporated into a
recent definition by the European Commission.

Information Society Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said:

\"Open standards are important to help create interoperable and
affordable solutions for everybody. They also promote competition by
setting up a technical playing field that is level to all market
players. This means lower costs for enterprises and, ultimately, the
consumer.\"

\"We need certain basic rules and regulations for the Information
Society to yield all its benefits and we have to have a framework in
place that protects enterprises and citizens, that fosters innovation
and that avoids unnecessary technical barriers\" said the Commissioner.
He added: \"Open standards are an ideal way to support such a
framework.\" Indeed, European enterprises have been at the cutting edge
of the digital era and helped create interoperable standards solutions
in fields such as mobile communications and digital broadcasting.\"
