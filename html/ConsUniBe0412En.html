            <p>Statement by Belgium</p>
            <p>"Belgium wishes to congratulate the Presidency on its efforts over the last five months to make headway with this proposal for a Directive and in general with all intellectual property projects.</p>
            <p>Like all delegations in the Council, the Belgian delegation wishes investments for innovation in any technical field to be fairly protected, including computer-implemented inventions . Belgium remains concerned about the impact of patentability of computer-implemented inventions on research and competitiveness, especially in the case of small and medium-sized undertakings, technological innovation, consumer rights and the interoperability of computer systems.</p>
            <p>On certain points the Council has made a number of welcome amendments to the draft compromise, particularly as regards the exclusion in the enacting terms of the Directive of computer programmes proper from patent law protection and the definition of the concept of "technical contribution". However, the text still does not appear to fully allay Belgium's concerns, particularly the risk of an obstacle to the interoperability of computer systems.</p>
            <p>On this matter, the Belgian delegation considers that a reminder of the possible application to right holders of Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is not a sufficient measure. Belgium considers that it would be preferable to lay down that, strictly speaking, certain acts needed to ensure the interoperability of computer systems cannot be regarded as an infringement of a patent.</p>
            <p>In the same way as an ordinary highway is not designed or intended for vehicles of a certain type or of a certain manufacturer, we must also prevent the information highway or its technical components from being governed by exclusive patent-based property rights. Patents for software which regulates the exchange of information or interoperability, the way in which different programmes talk to each other, will ultimately result in tollbooths being erected on the information highway and in restrictions on the categories of data bases which can be freely exchanged. This obviously hampers innovation but more fundamentally it impedes the free distribution of information and participation in tomorrow's information society.</p>
            <p>Despite the efforts made to arrive at a satisfactory compromise for all members of the Council, the above reasons have led the Belgian delegation to abstain in the hope that its concerns will be better reflected in the text of the Directive at a later stage in the proceedings."</p>
