The replies to this consultation will be taken into account when the Commission will eventually decide on the actual revision of the Regulation, which would be launched in 2007.</li>

These rules will be adopted by the ENISA Management Board on a proposal from the Commission, prepared by DG INFSO. The Commission intends to adopt these proposals in the first quarter of 2006.

            <li>Short Range Devices are key enablers for a range of applications supporting important EU policies (e.g. eHealth, eInclusion, eSafety, etc.). The market development for such devices is highly dependent on economies of scale and it is therefore important that the potential of the internal market be exploited to its fullest extent by ensuring that harmonised frequencies and conditions of use are available in a timely fashion.

            <li><ul>
            <li>Brief Description: R&amp;D collaboration and knowledge transfer between universities and industry constitute one of the weaknesses of the European research and innovation system. Initiatives to facilitate these relations have been implemented. However, Europe's current rules and practices are fragmented and lack a transnational dimension. There is therefore a need to promote consistency in the rules and practices applied across Europe in this field. To this end, the Commission will adopt in 2006 a [recommendation] communication containing recommendations to improve research collaboration and technology transfer between public research and industry. This communication <a href="ese" title="wikilink">guidelines</a> will build on good practices identified from existing initiatives of Member States and of stakeholders, and from recommendations made by CREST under the Open Method of Coordination as applied to the 3 % Action Plan.</li>

            <li>Many MS use fiscal incentives when trying to increase private R&amp;D spending. The objective of the Communication are to (i) clarify the key legal conditions for Member States' R&amp;D tax incentives resulting from EU law (EC Treaty non-discrimination and State Aid rules); (ii) highlight measures of good practice for R&amp;D fiscal treatment and incentives in Member States that could serve as a model for others. The Communication is thus intended to provide an overall EU framework to ensure a more effective use of fiscal incentives in favour of R&amp;D, which will also provide specific guidance to ensure their optimal EU-wide use.</li>

            <li>2nd quarter 2006 - INFSO - Communication on security issues (spam, malware, etc)
            <ul>
            <li><ul>
            <li>Building on the 2002 e-Privacy Directive and the subsequent Communication on spam, many efforts have been made to fight spam. Fighting spam works but the threat is evolving. Spam is increasingly sophisticated, fraudulent (e.g. phishing) or indeed criminal; also it is increasingly a vehicle for related activities based on programmes like spyware and malware. These security threats are undermining user confidence and hence, the value of the Internet and electronic communications. This is why they have been banned by EU law (e.g. e-Privacy Directive, Framework Decision on Attacks against information systems). However, legislation is not enough and will only produce results if combined with enforcement measures, industry cooperation and best practices, and better user awareness. International cooperation is also important. This Communication will address these issues.</li>

            <ul>
            <li><ul>
            <li>Research and Development in eHealth has resulted in proofs of eHealth benefits, including financial. For EU citizens to enjoy the benefits and for the eHealth industry (mainly <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a>) to sustain one of the largest growths within ICT and healthcare sectors, the local and regional pilots need to scale to support national and EU wide services. For that, the connectivity (interoperability) of the systems is needed for easy access to vital information. This Commission Staff Working Paper will address these issues.</li>

            <li><a href="ICTs" title="wikilink">ICTs</a> have the potential to facilitate independent living of elderly, thus increasing their quality of life and autonomy and reducing the need for being institutionalised.

This Communication announces an Article 169 initiative (that will be proposed for adoption at the end of 2006) aiming at providing the necessary legal and organisational framework for large-scale European research cooperation in this area.</li>

            <ul>
            <li><ul>
            <li>The 1st Commission Recommendation on Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) dates from December 1999 and was published in the Official Journal of 25.01.2000 (L19 page 64). Being almost six years old, it does not reflect any more the state of the technological development. In addition, the publication of a later update was already foreseen in the 1st Recommendation and was also mentionned as a possibility in the 2st eSafety Communication. These are the reasons for issuing a new Recommendation.</li>

It will take stock of actions already taken and identify areas where an action at EU level can provide particular added value, while respecting subsidiarity and activities already undertaken by Member States. It will also provide a link to further security related activities planned for 2006.</li>

            <li>The aim of this memorandum is first to report on the implementation of SEC(2004) 1265 since October 2004. Progress from horizontal DGs will be made, for instance regarding the Commission Enterprise Architecture, corporate authentication service, corporate portal, eDomec, to name a few. It then investigates new challenges regarding information integration for integrated management, leveraging Commission IT assets and development of new applications. Next, itpresents a Master Plan to respond to these challenges and to implement the Corporate Portal and associated data warehouses as foreseen in SEC(2004) 1265. A business case and required resources (equipment, labour and costs) will conclude the document.</li>
