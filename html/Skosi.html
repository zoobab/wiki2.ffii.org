            <p>Jan Husar:</p>
            <p>Currently I'm the chairman of SKOSI.org and the Slovakian Representative of FFII.org. Here you can find described the work I have accomplished and and some of our plans</p>
            <h2 id="skosi.org_slovak_open_source_initiative">SKOSI.org / Slovak Open Source Initiative</h2>
            <p>The Slovak Open Source Initiative was founded to provide a basis for the Open Society by using Open Source and Open Standards technologies such as the <a href="OpenDocument" title="wikilink">OpenDocument</a> Format, the Apache Web server and the <a href="OpenOffice" title="wikilink">OpenOffice</a>.org suite. We are primarily focusing on the government and education sectors, open source and open standards communities, and national projects for 'Informatisation' (which is the deployment of (mostly) public sector computer infrastructure), and educating citizens (not only in schools). SKOSI.org is young organization, currently in existence for only 4 months.</p>
            <p>So far we have managed to support the community with a few projects and some partnership events. This entails me working 100% for SKOSI.org purposes (which íncludes supporting FFII.org).</p>

            <h2 id="skosi.org_foundation">SKOSI.org Foundation</h2>
            <p>It started as SKUUG (Slovak Unix User Group), and tried to improve upon the support given by <a href="LUGs" title="wikilink">LUGs</a> (Linux User Groups) in promoting FOSS and GNU/linux. Then we became involved with the troubles with software patents, weird informatisation and similar things. I tried to reform SKUUG into SKOSI which first of all will support all FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) not only Unix Systems. Later on we started to support Open Standarts and Open Technology software such as Java, which also attracts more support from corporate members such as Sun or IBM. Right now, there is no legal base, but this will change at the end of this month. We did a lot of work even without a legal foundation. We learned a lot from projects such as the Apache Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation.</p>
            <h2 id="skosi.org_and_slovak_press">SKOSI.org and slovak press</h2>
            <p>So far we have managed to do two articles regarding informatisation and the wrong things that happened with it.</p>
            <h2 id="skosi.org_national_plans">SKOSI.org national Plans</h2>
            <p>Currently we are planning to do better support for our currently active projects (mainly <a href="OpenOffice" title="wikilink">OpenOffice</a>.org support). Priority One is <a href="OpenDocument" title="wikilink">OpenDocument</a> information. At the end of the year the Committee of Informatisation will set the 'Electronic Standarts in the Governmental Informatisation of Slovakia'. We must work hard or we will be stuck with Microsoft's "Open" XML and the like. There is a lot work to do here. The next big step is to try to fuse our two localisation projects into one bigger SLT (Slovak Localization Team) which will have the task of localising smaller projects such as Ubuntu Linux, <a href="OpenOffice" title="wikilink">OpenOffice</a>.org, and GNU tools, etc. We can provide more people and have poven that we can do localisation extremely effectively (such as releasing <a href="OpenOffice" title="wikilink">OpenOffice</a>.org 2.0 4 days after stable english release). We wish to attract more localisation teams in Slovakia.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="OpenClassroom" title="wikilink">OpenClassroom</a> (OpenSource for basic and high schools project)</li>
            <li>FOSS for local self-goverment of city Martin</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 id="skosi.org_international_plans">SKOSI.org international plans</h2>
            <p>This month we joined a partneship with a similar Czech foundation, the OSS Alliance Czech Republic (www.oss.cz). They have cz.OpenOffice.org, ubuntu czech, a mozilla team and they are supported by Czech Ministry of Informatics. We also have entered into a partnership with aaso.pl (Akademia Alternativnych systemow operacnych). Together we are planning to form V4 (Vysegrad Four) Alliance which will later on form the European Open Technology Alliance. Right now we are in the planning stage. Later on, I can give more information about how things should look.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>plans with OSS.cz

            <h2 id="future">FUTURE</h2>
            <p>Things like Swpat, Ipred, and EU directives for Open Knowledge are really important for us. This is why I'm so involved in FFII- becuase it matters. I wanted you to know that we manage to support FFII in many more ways than it appears. I'm happy to receive any comments regarding these steps. As always I think I must have missed many important things; I will try to do it better next time :)</p>
