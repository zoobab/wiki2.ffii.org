            <p>Java ES 5 Porting Plan September 12, 2005 (v1.1)</p>
            <p>1.0 Proposed Plan to Java ES PMT on September 13, 2005: Release JES 5 on Windows simultaneously with Solaris and Linux. Release JES 5 on HP-UX 60 days after Solaris, Linux and Windows</p>
            <p>2.0 Proposed Model: Porting engineers work side-by-side with <a href="CPTs" title="wikilink">CPTs</a> to port Windows for <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a>. This will eliminate the need for forking sources. If incremental funding is an issue, we should consider colocated development only for high risk products (identified below) Loan out testing resources to product QE/QA teams so that joint testing can be done for Windows. All product-specific testing for Windows will be done by CPT's. This will eliminate the need for separate validation of test results and signoff. JES specific testing (e.g., installer, post-integration) will be done by porting team. If incremental funding is an issue, we should consider colocated testing only for high risk products (identified below)</p>
            <p>3.0 Proposed Build Schedule:</p>
            <p>Build 1 (Sh Comp, WS, WPS, SR, MQ, Comms-1) 12/7/05 Build 2 (AS, DS, PS, AM, Comms-2) 12/21/05 Build 3 (Open build) 1/11/06 Build 4 (Beta build) 2/1/06 Build 5 2/22/06 Build 6 3/15/06 Build 7 4/5/06 Build 8 (RR build) 4/26/06 RR (Solaris, Linux, Windows) 6/7/06 GA (Solaris, Linux, Windows) 7/10/06</p>
            <p>4.0 Analysis of Products in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a>:</p>
            <p>New Products/Technologies: in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a>: Integration Server, Monitoring Console</p>
            <p>Products/technologies in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> that are considered major releases : Portal, Application Server, DSEE, <a href="WebServer" title="wikilink">WebServer</a>,, Message Queue, Calendar Server, Messaging Server, Comms Express, Cacao/MFWK In terms of complexity: Cacao/MFWK, DSEE, Application Server, Portal Server, <a href="WebServer" title="wikilink">WebServer</a>, Message Queue</p>
            <p>Products/technologies in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> that are considered minor/update releases : Instant Messaging, Delegated Admin, Web Proxy, Service Registry, Access Manager, Installer</p>

            <p>Products that are not ported to Windows by <a href="CPTs" title="wikilink">CPTs</a> and are not Java based:</p>
            <p><code>   Messaging Server, Calendar Server</code></p>
            <p>High risk products for development (intersection of the above and R3 learnings):</p>
            <p><code>   Messaging Server, Calendar Server, DSEE, Cacao/MFWK, Integration Server</code></p>
            <p>High risk products for testing (intersection of the above and R3 learnings): Messaging Server, Calendar Server, DSEE, Cacao/MFWK, Application Server, Web Server, Web Proxy, Access Manager</p>
            <p>5.0 Joint development on Windows</p>
            <p>5.1 Development activities will include the following</p>
            <p>Source Merge Building product Packaging Core product porting Install integration Developer unit testing</p>
            <p>Each of these activities are described below. Source Merge For products that are minor releases from <a href="JES4" title="wikilink">JES4</a> this involves (a) merge Porting Branch contents to <a href="JES3" title="wikilink">JES3</a>/4 Sustaining Branch, and (b) merge Porting Branch contents to <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> Development Branch For products that are major upgrades from <a href="JES4" title="wikilink">JES4</a> releases this involves (a) merge Porting branch contents to <a href="JES3" title="wikilink">JES3</a>/4 Sustaining Branch for the sake of single sustaining branch, and (b) Work directly on <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> branch for <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> porting work For certain products eg, Portal, DSEE, there is no merge involved since <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> is new source base and file layout has significantly changed. we could still reuse porting code changes we did in <a href="JES3" title="wikilink">JES3</a>/4 but they need to be 'carried over manually' on an as needed basis only. Building product Getting products to build in local Wipro environment is important to understand what changes have occured in the product and how much of our past porting work can be reused. Most of the porting previously done for makefiles etc can be reused. Since most products are in active development as of right now, this is a good time to start building products on Solaris, port build scripts if necessary and make product build on HPUX/Windows. Setting up tinderbox and establishing nightly builds is also part of this activity. Native packaging Most of the work previously done for packaging can be reused in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a>. In some cases, product teams have changed their packaging model, mostly in order to simplify the model, reducing number of packages or modularizing for better patch management etc. Once the build is done, we should focus on getting the packaging correct. Since we already adhere to good packaging policies, there should be no major surprises here. Initial Configuration Initial configurators to be ported to both HPUX and Windows. Several products have reworked their configurators, in some cases simplifying the interface and using Java. We incurred quite a bit of porting effort in <a href="JES3" title="wikilink">JES3</a> for porting shell-based configurators to Java; much of that can be reused, particularly in cases like Portal, we may not need much porting. Requirements for each product w.r.t Initial Configuration needs to be identified. Core product porting Effort involved for actual porting of product code. For products that are Java based (Portal, AM, AS, UWC, DA etc) this effort is fairly minimal. For products that are C/C++ based, we did considerable amount of coding depending on whether the product was built for HP/Windows (like <a href="WebServer" title="wikilink">WebServer</a>, <a href="DirServer" title="wikilink">DirServer</a>) or not (Calendar, Messaging) and if those native products have made significant code changes in <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> that would require additional porting effort. Assessment to be made after looking at <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> sources and comparing them with our work from <a href="JES3" title="wikilink">JES3</a>/4 Install integration On HPUX, this is essentially creating the PPXML for the product and nothing else. On Windows, there is more work involved in getting the install layout, Windows specific configuration Some of this work will be done by the porting install team but porting product developers must be active participants and contributors to product-installer integration. Developer unit testing Developers will test the product during each of the above activities but it is also important that they are able to spend quality time just testing various aspects of the product that may or may not be exposed to the development aspects listed above. for example, this involves testing the product in a deployment configuration, trying various administrative features and uninstall testing etc.</p>
            <p>5.2 Resource allocation and Tentative schedule</p>
            <p><code>   Product     Location        Porting engineer        Schedule</code></p>
            <p>Comms SCA Harish Sep-Oct 2005 MQ SCA Dattu Oct-Nov 2005 AM SCA Arun Mohan Oct-Nov 2005 Integration Server SCA Sajesh Oct-Nov 2005 Cacao/MFWK GNBL Bobby Oct-Nov 2005 DSEE GNBL Madhav Oct-Nov 2005 App Server IEC Varun Oct-Nov 2005 Web Server IEC Arumugam Oct-Nov 2005 Portal Server IEC Vasanth Oct-Nov 2005 WPS IEC TBD Oct-Nov 2005 Comms Express IEC Arun Mohan Oct-Nov 2005</p>
            <p>5.3 Assumptions and Risks</p>
            <p>It is assumed that All developers including porting developers use same branch No special Porting Branch will be created No merge or sync up required No need to align with specific tags for Solaris milestone builds Risks are Ramp up time on new products/technologies: Integration Server, MFWK/CACAO Late binding products Ability of porting developers to be productive in a new environment Availability of shared components Late changes to core products Stability of products before porting begins Slip in <a href="JES4" title="wikilink">JES4</a> schedule Availability of hardware resources with product teams</p>
            <p>6.0 Co-located testing on Windows</p>
            <p>6.1 Testing activities include the following</p>
            <p>Product specific testing includes BAT, sanity, functional, stress, system, deployment and other testing that is specific to the products (versus Java ES). For types of testing see: <a href="http://multiplatform.sfbay.sun.com/Wiki.jsp?page=RR_QA_HP_WIN_Dashboard" class="uri">http://multiplatform.sfbay.sun.com/Wiki.jsp?page=RR_QA_HP_WIN_Dashboard</a> Product specific testing will be the responsibility of component product teams. This includes identification of what tests to run, test execution, validation of test results and test signoff. Porting resources will be loaned to component teams for test execution.</p>
            <p>JES specific testing will be the responsibility of the porting team. This will include installer, upgrade/migration (jes stack upgrade only, will not include component product upgrade testing), compatibility, performance and post integration testing.</p>
            <p>6.2 Resource Allocation and Tentative Schedule:</p>
            <p><code>   Product     Location        Porting engineer    Schedule</code></p>
            <p>Integration Server SCA TBD Oct-Feb 2006 Comms SCA/IEC Prema, Suriya Nov-Feb 2006 MQ, AM SCA Kanda Nov-Feb 2006 Cacao/MFWK GNBL TBD Oct-Feb 2006 DSEE GNBL Chiddu Oct-Feb 2006 App Server IEC Devesh Nov-Dec 2005 Web Server IEC Shoba Nov-Dec 2005 Portal Server IEC Nawaz Nov-Dec 2005 WPS IEC Murugan Nov-Dec 2005 Comms Express IEC TBD Nov-Dec 2005 6.3 Assumptions and Risks: It is assumed that Product teams have windows infrastructure Product teams will train QA resources on JES 5 changes and test suites. Product teams will host and manage loaned QA resources. Risks are: Ability to ramp up with new hires Overlap of <a href="JES4" title="wikilink">JES4</a> and <a href="JES5" title="wikilink">JES5</a> activities Slips in <a href="JES4" title="wikilink">JES4</a> Additional hardware requirements from product teams New requirements from product teams</p>
            <p>7.0 Model to address communication and governance issue: Porting engineer responsible for component product porting and testing joins component engineering meeting aliases Porting is represented on component product P-teams. If resources is an issue, atleast the high risk products need to be covered. Rethink the governance model, i.e., phase reviews of individual porting projects at component <a href="PACs" title="wikilink">PACs</a></p>
            <p>8.0 Incremental Resources Required:</p>
            <p>For Development 4 people to travel to SCA for 2 months (8 weeks) 2 people to travel to GNBL for 2 months (8 weeks) For Testing (incremental) 4 people to travel to SCA for 2 months (8 weeks) 2 people to travel to GNBL for 2 months (8 weeks) Capital and other costs: TBD</p>
