The agenda shall be sent to the other members of the Council and to the Commission at least 14 days before the beginning of the meeting. (1) See statements (a) and (b) set out below # --&gt; here irrelevant</p>
            <p>2. The provisional agenda shall contain the items in respect of which a request for inclusion on the agenda, together with any documents relating thereto, has been received by the General Secretariat from a member of the Council or from the Commission at least 16 days before the beginning of that meeting. The provisional agenda shall also indicate by way of an asterisk the items on which the Presidency, a member of the Council or the Commission may request a vote. Such an indication shall be made once all the procedural requirements provided for by the Treaties have been complied with.</p>
            <p>3. # irrelevant</p>
            <p>4. Only items in respect of which the documents have been sent to the members of the Council and to the Commission at the latest by the date on which the provisional agenda is sent may be placed on that agenda.</p>
            <p>5. The General Secretariat shall transmit to the members of the Council and to the Commission requests for the inclusion of items in the agenda and documents in respect of which the time limits specified above were not respected. # rest is irrelevant</p>
            <p>6. The provisional agenda shall be divided into Part A and Part B. Items for which approval by the Council is possible without discussion shall be included in Part A, but this does not exclude the possibility of any member of the Council or of the Commission expressing an opinion at the time of the approval of these items and having statements included in the minutes.</p>
            <p>7. The agenda shall be adopted by the Council at the beginning of each meeting. The inclusion in the agenda of an item other than those appearing on the provisional agenda shall require unanimity in the Council. Items entered in this way may be put to the vote if all the procedural requirements provided for by the Treaties have been complied with.</p>
            <p>8. However, an "A" item shall be withdrawn from the agenda, <strong>unless the Council decides otherwise</strong>, if a position on an "A" item might lead to <strong>further discussion thereof or if a member of the Council or the Commission so requests.</strong></p>

This practical arrangement shall have no effect on the rule according to Article 11(1) of the Council's Rules of Procedure.</em></p>
            <p>In such cases, Council deliberations shall be open to the public through transmission of the Council meeting by audiovisual means, notably in an overflow room. <strong>The outcome of voting shall be indicated by visual means.</strong></p>

            <p>1. The Council shall vote on the initiative of its President. <strong>The President shall, furthermore, be required to open a voting procedure on the initiative of a member of the Council or of the Commission, provided that a majority of the Council's members so decides.</strong></p>

            <h3 id="the_presidency_is_neutral">3. The Presidency is neutral</h3>
            <p>The Presidency must, by definition, be neutral and impartial. It is the moderator for discussions and cannot therefore favour either its own preferences or those of a particular Member State. This presupposes both good coordination with its own State's spokesmen so that they can voice the national position without impeding the work of the Presidency, <strong>as well as taking due account, on their own merits, of all positions expressed.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The duty to be neutral exists alongside the political dimension which informs the conduct of Union business and which is particularly apparent in the order of priority set in the choice and handling of items of business. This order of priority is occasioned by considerations of topicality and of deadlines, as well as by the political tone which the Presidency wishes to set for its six-month period.</strong> In its role as moderator, the Presidency must also take action where it notes that a stalemate has occurred; this will take the form of compromise suggestions to reconcile the different interests involved in a single issue or a set of interconnected issues (package deal), which inevitably means that political choices have to be made.</p>
            <h3 id="the_presidency_is_always_in_the_hands_of_the_council">5. The Presidency is always in the hands of the Council</h3>
            <p>Any procedural decision by the Presidency may be challenged by the Council by a simple majority. Any statement by or letter from the Presidency expressing the Council position, particularly in its relations with the other institutions, must meet with the Council's agreement.</p>

            <h3 id="the_council">4. The Council</h3>
            <p>(...)</p>
            <p>Like the agenda for Coreper, the Council's agenda is divided into two parts:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>`A' items, which the Council may adopt without any discussion. However, a member of the Council may always request the withdrawal of one of these items on the actual day of the Council meeting (the item then being held over until a forthcoming Council, or kept on the agenda by a simple majority if the item had been entered 14 days beforehand). Delegations may, additionally, make statements when `A' items are adopted (1);</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>(1) See also Chapter III, Section 4(g) , `Publication of votes</em>'</p>
            <ul>
            <li>`B' items. These are the items which the Council will discuss.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="cg_vol_1_chapter_iii_1">CG Vol 1, Chapter III</h2>
            <h3 id="d_the_council_proceedings">4 d) The Council proceedings</h3>
            <p>In the interests of concision and lower costs for the Council, the Presidency must endeavour to avoid proceedings continuing beyond 21.00.</p>
            <p>As regards conduct of business, the Presidency proceeds in turn to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>take note of `Other business' items and any requests for changes to the agenda;</li>
            <li>adopt the agenda;</li>
            <li>adopt the `A' items, taking account of any statements (1) or reservations. These `A' items are normally adopted en masse. If an item is the subject of a statement by one or more members of the Council which is likely to give rise to a discussion or a request for withdrawal, it can either be withdrawn from the agenda or left on the agenda on the basis of a simple majority vote (see above);</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(1) Council members who make a statement may request that it appear in the Council minutes. <em>See Chapter III, Section 4(g), `Publication of votes</em>'</p>
            <h3 id="e_voting_procedure">4 e) Voting procedure</h3>
            <p>As regards voting procedure, Article 11 CRP provides that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the Council votes on the initiative of its President. The President is also required to open a voting procedure on the initiative of a member of the Council or of the Commission, provided that a majority of the Council's members so decides (simple majority);</li>
            </ul>
