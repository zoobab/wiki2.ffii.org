            <p><em>In its action plan 'Strategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries' the European Commission/DG Trade sets strong standards for trade policy. Criminal product piracy and counterfeing is a severe problem of international trade. By the paper the Commission grants itself a strong and broad mandate to lobby lawmakers in third countries. This includes pressure for unlimited extention of the scope of patent law without any economic rationale behind. Experience with similar EU projects in the past such as the EU IPR Enforcement directive raises awareness that issues unrelated to the original intent of the measures would slip in. The COM strategy also would provide a mandate for the Commission to impose their planned software patent legislation on other non-EU European Patent Convention members.</em></p>

            </ul>
            <p>... Raising the awareness of users / consumers in third countries. This must be done from two perspectives: (a) to promote the benefits of IPR in terms of promotion of creativity, investment, transfer of technology, protection of traditions and quality; (b) to inform about the dangers of IPR violations to public health, consumer protection, public security, etc.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Under-estimating the value of intellectual property rights contributes to ineffective enforcement. To enhance this aspect of the intellectual property rights system, it would be useful for some (fast) developing countries to assess the value of the industries based primarily on intellectual property rights21. This could lead to an appreciation of the value of intellectual property rights in terms of a country's economic environment, as well as in respect to economic, social and cultural growth and development.</p>
            <p>In some of the most "problematic" countries the authorities appear to be fully aware of the importance of IPR for the development of the country and domestic right-holders demand enforcement of IPR as rigorously as foreign right-holders. The problem is that the piracy/counterfeiting industry is an important element of their economy. It is therefore clear that there is a broader picture which cannot be tackled merely under the IP angle. Only a comprehensive policy involving authorities at national, regional and local level can provide a solution.</p>
            <p>.…</p>
            <p>The Commission considers that the vast majority of the problems affecting holders of the different types of intellectual property rights are common and consequently, are most effectively addressed by an integrated strategy. The strategy now proposed aims at improving enforcement against violations of all kinds of IP (copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, patents, designs, etc.).</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>This is a very crucial point for the efficacy of the present Strategy. DG TRADE and other DGs with external responsibilities have an important and well defined role in terms of improving the enforcement of IPR in third countries. However, the most "operational" responsibilities of the fight against piracy and counterfeiting lie with Member States or with other DGs. The most visible and/or immediate results in this fight will always be achieved by the customs authorities, the police, national courts, the harmonisation of laws and procedures and the creation of information exchange mechanisms at Community level. In these (mainly domestic) areas DG TRADE can only provide a limited contribution. The situation is, however, different with regard to enforcement in third countries. In this case, DG TRADE and the Commission services with external responsibilities in these matters, with the cooperation of the EC Delegations in third countries, can certainly play a key role in achieving the implementation of the tasks proposed in the present Strategy.</p>

            <h3 id="flaws_of_the_paper">Flaws of the paper</h3>
            <p>Combatting piracy and counterfeing is a sound task. In the past combatting criminal product piracy was often misused to create new enforcement mechanisms that endanger usuals markets pratice. Using the general lobbying term 'Intellectual Property' the Commission lumps up several entirely different fields of law such as copyright law, patent law, trademark law etc. which are guided by different rules and lie on different foundations. The Commission further mixes up normative and positive questions of such field of law.</p>
            <p>As the Commission states "The strategy now proposed aims at improving enforcement against violations of all kinds of IP (copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, patents, designs, etc.)"</p>
            <p>Patent law in particular underlies the territorial principle and is applied for a certain market. Despite international obligations such as the <a href="TRIPs" title="wikilink">TRIPs</a> treaty each nation is free to decide whether to apply a patent regime or not on its home market. The <a href="TRIPs" title="wikilink">TRIPs</a> treaty was intended to make sure that those referred rights are not misused as non-tarific trade barriers and sets for signatory states certain requirements for patentability (TRIPs 27). Here this free trade perspective is dropped in favour of a kind of 'neoimperialistism-style' total IPR strategy which even outperforms older US foreign policy agendas to "protect intellectual property abroad".</p>
            <p>For instance <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/speeches/2003/20030404/default.htm" title="wikilink">Alan Greenspan (2003-04-04)</a> points out that problems were far more complicated than the "more protection" mechanics suggests:</p>
            <p><code>If our objective is to maximize economic growth, are we </code><br />
            <code>striking the right balance in our protection of intellectual</code><br />
            <code>property rights? Are the protections sufficiently broad to </code><br />
            <code>encourage innovation but not so broad as to shut down follow-on </code><br />
            <code>innovation? Are such protections so vague that they produce </code><br />
            <code>uncertainties that raise risk premiums and the cost of capital? </code><br />
            <code>How appropriate is our current system--developed for a world </code><br />
            <code>in which physical assets predominated--for an economy in which </code><br />
            <code>value increasingly is embodied in ideas rather than tangible capital?</code></p>
            <p>Having a patent regime with a smaller scope does not mean "piracy" as there are no rights existing prior to the patent grant and national patent rules apply to all market players. <a href="TRIPs" title="wikilink">TRIPs</a> main purpose is that foreign players will not get discriminated. Products imported from the EU are governed by European laws. Patent law has no reputable foundation in natural law, the so-called property teaching which the term IPR suggests is misleading from a legal perspective. A decision about the scope of the patent system lies in the competence of the national lawmaker of the affected country only. Balance is needed, so that the positive effects predominate.</p>
            <p>Patent law in particular is an incentive system and has <strong>no benefits magically associated with it</strong>. In theory national member states shall set the scope of the system <strong>on the basis of an economic rationale</strong>, reaching the right balance and optimizing the effects of the incentive system by adjusting the scope.</p>
            <p>As F.A. von Hayek (Hayek, "'Free' Enterprise and Competitive Order". In: Individualism and Economic Order, Chicago: 1948, 113-114) wrote:</p>
            <p><code>The problem of the prevention of monopoly and the prevention of </code><br />
            <code>competition is raised much more acutely in certain other fields </code><br />
            <code>to which the concept of property has been extended only in recent</code><br />
            <code>times. [..] Patents, in particular, are specially interesting </code><br />
            <code>from our point of view because they provide so clear an </code><br />
            <code>illustration of how it is necessary in all such instances not </code><br />
            <code>to apply a ready-made formula but to go back to the rationale of</code><br />
            <code>the market system and to decide for each class what the precise </code><br />
            <code>rights are to be which the government ought to protect.</code></p>
            <p>The Commission paper shares a different view:</p>
            <p><code>Raising the awareness of users / consumers in third countries.</code><br />
            <code>This must be done from two perspectives: (a) to promote the </code><br />
            <code>benefits of IPR in terms of promotion of creativity, investment, </code><br />
            <code>transfer of technology, protection of traditions and quality;</code></p>
            <p>Such participation in opinion building of the people abroad the Commission here does not adhere to the instrumental view underlying patent law.</p>
            <p>The EU may not impose new laws on third countries and misuse the trade sanction system for limiting the souvereignity of other states.</p>
            <p>Further, the COM strategy is also <strong>a kind of mandate for the Commission to impose their planned software patent legislation on other non-EU European Patent Convention members</strong>.</p>
            <h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>If the EU lobbies foreign lawmakers or wants to set foreign lawmakers and governments under pressure via trade sanctions, who will control the Commission? Who will decide which are the rules whose worldwide promotion is in the interest of Europe?</li>
            <li>Is the unspoken goal of the Commission to promote "strengthening of IPR" as a non-tariffic trade barrier designed to keep competitive economies from newly industrialised countries at bay?</li>
            <li>Assuming that software patents are working against European business interests and creating a net flow of unjustified license fees toward the USA, is the Commission willing to counter-act the <a href="SwpatusEn" title="wikilink">international "IPR" lobbying of the US</a> in this area?</li>
            <li>Is the European Commission seeking a mandate to impose EU rules on non-EU members of the European Patent Convention?</li>
