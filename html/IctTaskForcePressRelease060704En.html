            <p>-&gt; [ <a href="IctTaskForceOpenLetter060703En" title="wikilink">Open Letter</a> | <a href="IctTaskForceEn" title="wikilink">ICT Task Force</a> | <a href="SwpatcninoEn" title="wikilink">News</a> ]</p>
            <hr />
            <p><em>Brussels, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Ljubljana, 4 July 2006 -- In an open letter to the EU Commission, six small business associations have called on Commissioners Verheugen and Reding to modify their plans for a task force, designed "to define the future EU policy in ICT".</em></p>
            <hr />
            <p>The proposed task force mainly consists of large IT firms, such as IBM, Cisco, and Intel, and the undersigning associations accuse the Commission of ignoring the fact that 80 percent of the European IT sector, by value, consists of small and medium-sized firms, who are unrepresented in this task force but must bear the brunt of the policies defined by the EU Commission.</p>
            <p>Pieter Hintjens, President of FFII, an association which represents 3500 European IT companies, states: <em>"The idea that we can create EU-wide policy and legislation without input from a broad base has been discredited. The EU must become more inclusive and less elitist if it is to survive the challenges of public opinion in the decades ahead. We are giving the Commission the opportunity to work with the majority now, rather than face mass opposition later when it presents yet one more set of special-interest proposals that damage the market."</em></p>
            <p>David Ramsden, Chairman of PCG, a cross-sector representative body that represents the interests of 12000 freelancers in the UK points out: <em>"Many of the EU's most dynamic businesses in the ICT sector are also the smallest. The companies represented by PCG exemplify the significance of small firms to this area of the economy. It is vital that they are fully represented on any Task Force or other body relating to the sector."</em></p>
            <p>Marco Schulze, spokesman for the 600 German companies of !PatentFrei.de adds: <em>"We hope that the European Commission, which ignored the interests of majorities already repeatedly, will take the true mainspring of economic strength - namely the</em> !SMEs <em>- into account this time. Europe cannot afford to shape its policies according to the wishes of financially powerful minorities, if it really pursues to reach the Lissabon goals."</em></p>
            <p>Slawomir Kosz, President of the Polish Software Market Association declares: <em>"I think that representatives of the new member states should be involved, and this is clearly not the case in the current Task Force."</em></p>
            <p>Stefan Zickgraf, Secretary of CEA-PME, an umbrella assocation of !SMEs in Brussels precises: <em>"All relevant SME-stakeholders should be heard to keep up with promises made. CEA-PME represents more than 250.000</em> !SMEs <em>throughout the EU 25, of which an important number are active in the ICT sector. We don't believe that the actual Task Force sufficiently represents SME interest. Indeed it looks like it is only pretending to do so, giving floor to a single SME-organisation, which cannot on its own integrally represent all SME interests in these matters."</em></p>
            <p>Andrej Mertlej, President of the Slovene Software Developers Assocation KODA, says: <em>"We must not forget that SAP, Microsoft and Apple were all</em> !SMEs <em>once. To grow the big we must foster the small. If the EU is serious about its bet on</em> !SMEs/, the inclusion of smaller IT companies and their representatives would be considered a strong statement and a bright waypoint."/</p>
