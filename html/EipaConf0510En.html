            <p>At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support “the knowledge society”.</p>
            <p>Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world, particularly to stop internet piracy.</p>
            <p>The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy, of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.</p>
            <p>EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries, and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.</p>

            <p>Luxembourg, 30 June 2005</p>
            <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
            <p>On 6 and 7 October 2005, the Luxembourg Antenna of the European Institute of Public Administration  the European Centre for Judges and Lawyers  is organising a seminar on</p>
            <p>Latest Developments in the Field of Intellectual Property</p>
            <p>At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support “the knowledge society”.</p>
            <p>Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world, particularly to stop internet piracy.</p>
            <p>The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy, of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.</p>
            <p>EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries, and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.</p>
            <p>The seminar is aimed at lawyers, counsels in industrial property, representatives of national industrial property institutes or agencies, EU officials and national civil servants, professionals from the industry and research sector, academics and other professionals interested in intellectual property law.</p>
            <p>EIPA would be honoured to count you among the participants. For registrations received before the 9th of September, the registration fee is  650 (including documentation, beverages, 2 lunches and a dinner). The fee for registrations after this date will be 700. The working languages of the seminar will be French and English, and simultaneous interpretation between the two languages will be provided.</p>
            <p>Should you wish to receive more details about this seminar, please do not hesitate to contact Mrs Juliette MOLLICONE-BOUSSUGE, Programme Organiser, tel.: +352 426 230 304, fax: +352 426 237 eMail: Send We would be most grateful if you could also distribute this information to other persons who may be interested in this seminar.</p>
            <p>We look forward to welcoming you to this seminar.</p>
            <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
