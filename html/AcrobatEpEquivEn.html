            <p><em>What is software with a "further technical effect"? Word processing is often given as an example of software which cannot have something like that. Nonetheless, we found 10 granted European patents equivalent with US patents which cover the Adobe Acrobat software and its document format (</em>!AdobeReader <em>6.0 is a pdf-reader used by most</em> !MEPs <em>in the European Parliament, see copy of legal notice below). These patents would undoubtedly become enforceable with the Commission and Council versions of the directive.</em></p>
