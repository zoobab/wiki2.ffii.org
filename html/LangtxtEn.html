            <p><phm > That project isn't over [20:18:04] <phm > We still don't have a multilingual data base with the amendments in it. [20:18:14] <phm > And it's needed for reference. [20:18:42] <phm > It will be a basis of a lot of discussions in and around Council etc [20:19:06] <gibus> thanks phm, i've seen this page and send some missing french translations to gilles [20:19:10] <bkaindl> ok, thanks for the explanation! [20:19:40] <phm > I tried to put some things todo into <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/group/todo/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/group/todo/</a> [20:19:45] <phm > but it's still very rough. [20:19:47] <ijuz> phm: i can do at least one language, but is there a list of the syntax? you know for lists for example [20:20:45] <zoobab> Preparations are under way to withdraw the directive and legalise patents by means of an agreement between national patent officials, who are used to deciding patent policies among themselves. [20:20:48] <phm > Am17 | fr | Tout logiciel est non-brevetable, sauf s'il marche sur un ordinateur. ... [20:21:01] <zoobab> do you use leaks about that? [20:21:09] <ccorn> BTW, phm sent me account info to submit translations directly to mlhtimport@a2e.de. Questions: (1) Need to uncomment the special tags lang, login, passwd? (2) txtlang instead of lang (as in the template)? (3) Only uncomment changed text paragraphs or all? I'd then sent the result vial mailx, as suggested by phm. [20:21:44] <phm > Special tags at bottom must start with # and end with ; [20:22:00] <phm > 2 yes 3 yes [20:22:24] <ccorn> Thanks! [20:22:56] <phm > thank you. [20:23:58] <ijuz> phm: no, i saw this, i'm about this |%(linol| stuff [20:24:52] <phm > That kind of structure is explained at <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/langtxt/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/langtxt/</a> [20:25:29] <phm > Indeed with some amendments there are problems of choosing the right markup. [20:25:36] <phm > But we needn't worry about that at first. [20:26:14] <ijuz> is it not [20:26:35] <phm > The explanations are very rough. [20:26:56] <phm > %(al|Non-Brevetabilite du Logiciel|Tout logiciel ...) [20:27:22] <phm > would mean: we have a structure of paragraphs (alineae, separated by |), [20:27:28] <ijuz> yes, ok, i can guess them from other files, i just thought that there might be some documentation somewhere [20:28:03] <phm > Not many tags are needed, so I guess I should document them in more detail at the named page. [20:28:41] <gibus> .oO(one of these days you'll end up with XML) [20:29:32] <phm > I came from SGML/XML and found it unwieldy for the purpose of multilinguality managment [20:30:01] <phm > The tags usually won't get very complicated in this system. [20:30:08] <gibus> i know, i'm on the traduk list and seen your comment about that... [20:30:09] <ccorn> Yep, XML is a wrist-breaker (particularly <a href="DocBook" title="wikilink">DocBook</a>) :-) [20:30:10] <phm > Anything more complicated will be split into chunks. [20:30:30] <phm > One problem with SGML is that it tries to [20:30:50] <phm > put all text structures into one single hierarchy. [20:31:04] <phm > The %(q:...) tags etc are only for structures at a very low level. [20:31:28] <phm > And saying "low" is inaccurate, since they don't belong into one hierarchy. [20:31:29] <ijuz> phm: ok, so something else unclear: all amandments or the ones used in the plen0309 voting recom. or the ones that where voted for? [20:31:56] <phm > I'd say it would be very good to have all amendments in a database. [20:32:27] <phm > The Council people will claim that the EP chose poorly crafted ones instead of well crafted ones. [20:32:49] <phm > We will need to show that the alternatives are not better crafted but simply in favor of unlimited patentability. [20:33:13] <phm > They are trying to depict the EP as incompetent. [20:33:28] <phm > and to say that those who can judge well-craftedness should dictate the law. [20:33:32] <ijuz> ok, i'll do at least the .de amandment database file [20:33:45] <phm > i.e. turn this into a matter of legal technicality (not technicity) again. [20:34:09] <phm > great, that will encourage people. [20:35:56] <gibus> we have started a discussion by mail with Michèle, Gilles and Cédric for french translations [20:36:10] <gibus> thinks it's ok for us to translate to french [20:36:45] <phm > yes, thanks to you the swpat.ffii.org site now has better supply with french than with german texts. [20:36:58] <gibus> :) [20:37:50] <gibus> are there others priority (for french translation) than <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/kinv/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/kinv/</a> <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/prog/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/prog/</a> <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/itop/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/itop/</a> ? [20:38:01] <gibus> (priorities) [20:38:31] <phm > also <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/reag/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/reag/</a> [20:39:04] <phm > This may need to be reference by people when talking to politicians (national MPs) these days. [20:39:29] <gibus> ok i'll add that on the french wiki, and try to do some later this night</p>

            <ul>
            <li>it seems, it is not possible to send a mail with multiple translated texts attached, things get screwed (in my case, one file got imported but at the wrong place and overwrote another file I sent in)</li>
