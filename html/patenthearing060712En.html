            <hr />
            <p>Here is the draft agenda of the public hearing on the future patent policy in Europe to be held on the 12th July 2006. The European Commission (EC) will first present a document outlining the preliminary findings of the consultation based on replies received until 12 April 2006. Then, the Internal Market DG will directly consult stakeholders on their needs in relation to the legal framework and possible actions in the field of industrial property. The EC 39 selected stakeholders are supposed to "represent the balance of opinion in the written replies will speak on the issues raised" during the hearing. As you will see, patents proponents are mainly represented. There will also be time for an "open debate" and a presentation from the president of the European Patent Office (EPO), professor Alain Pompidou.</p>

            <p>Thomas Vintje is a lawyer working for the ECIS (European Committee for Interoperable Systems), which has filed comments on the Commission's consultation on future patent policy in Europe. In its submission, ECIS advocates a patent policy that is based on the fostering of competition and innovation for the benefit of consumers, accomplished by ensuring appropriate standards of patentability and examination, as well as by appreciating the important role played by interoperability. ECIS also urged the Commission to ensure adequate safeguards against misuse of the patent system. The greatest threat to an effective and credible patent system that serves all interests is the use of the patent system in a manner that subverts it, for example, by allowing entities to accumulate patents for the mere purpose of extricating royalties by threatening to stop the commercialisation of a product utilising the patent, without the entities implementing the patented technologies themselves, by using patents to prevent interoperability with dominant products or platforms, or by late disclosure of standards-related patents.</p>

            <p>Software are not patentable in Europe, in despite of the European Patent Office practices and the attempt by the European Commission to legalize these same practices with the directive on Computer implemented-inventions (CII) from 2003 to 2005. In fact, a software patent system in Europe could only be counterproductive and disastrous for economic development.</p>
            <p>For more information on the threat of software patents,see the US Blackberry case which perfectly illustrates that patent system is not adapted to ensure software IP protection, and even is dangerous to innovative and competitive businesses.</p>

            <p>However, the battle against software patents is not finished.</p>
            <p>--</p>
            <p>In January 2006, the European Commission started a public consultation "on the future of the Community Patent in Europe" on the pretext of promoting of developing free market and protecting innovation. In reality, the aim is to legalize software patents by transferring EU and member state legislative and judicial power to the European Patent Office. FFII first questioned the validity of the procedure, based on the serious lack of accessibility, which means that a majority of EU businesses were completely excluded from answering. That's why FFII recommended participation to those businesses that are able to do so, for "Open democracy" means more transparency and effective hearings of all stakeholders... Following a formal complaint by FFII to the European Commission's President Barroso, European the Commission agreed to extend its deadline from 31 March 2006 to 12 April 2006.</p>
            <p>The next step after the public consultation is the public hearing taking place the 12th July. The Commission is first supposed to present a document outlining the preliminary findings of the consultation based on replies received until 12 April 2006. But is highly possible the total number of answers worrying against the reintroduction of software patents won't be revealed as it is the habit of the European Commission. Then, the Internal Market DG will directly consult stakeholders on their needs in relation to the legal framework and possible actions in the field of industrial property. The European Commission 39 selected "stakeholders" supposed to reflect the balance of opinion in the written replies will speak on the issues raised during the hearing. In reality, the great majority are patents proponents, mostly software patent proponents like Nokia, Qualcomm, ICT Ireland, Thomson...</p>
            <p>One of the most important topics will be the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), which is a proposed patent law agreement aimed at creating an optional protocol to the European Patent Convention (EPC), which would commit its signatory states to an integrated judicial system. The main driving force behind the EPLA is legalising software patents and business method patents via case law, under the assumption that the European Patent Convention still forbids those with the European Patent Office nevertheless granting them since the mid 1980s. Moreover The proposed "European Patent Judiciary" would lack independent judges and sufficient democratic control.</p>
            <p>For more information, see <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/EplaEn" class="uri">http://wiki.ffii.org/EplaEn</a></p>
            <p>It seems that software patents are coming by the back doors, mainly through the European Patent litigation Agreement (EPLA) pushed by both the European Commission and the European Patent Office, in despite of the decision of the European Parliament to definitively bury the CII directive on the 6 July 2006. But the European Commission strikes back.</p>
            <p>Of course, FFII attend to this public consultation and Pieter Hintjens will speak in the name of FFII in order to defend the general interest of European software companies, accompanied with Florian Mueller who will speak in the name of the Open source communities. FFII is not alone, it seems that only 4 other <a href="NGOs" title="wikilink">NGOs</a> will speak against the threat of the European Patent Litigation Agreement.</p>
            <p>- UEAPME (Maria Cimaglia)</p>
            <p>- BEUC (Cornelia Kutterer)</p>
            <p>- PIMEC (Marcelino Currel - Suñol)</p>
            <p>- ECIS (Thomas Vinje)</p>
            <p>Welcome to the world of the European democracy and fair economic representativity.</p>
