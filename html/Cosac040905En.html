            <h2 id="meps_dutch_council_presidency_is_legislating_against_both_european_and_national_parliaments"><a href="MEPs" title="wikilink">MEPs</a>: Dutch Council Presidency is Legislating Against Both European and National Parliaments</h2>
            <p>Are EU laws made by elected representatives or by unknown ministerial bureaucrats?</p>
            <p>A longstanding legitimacy conflict once again erupted last week, when a representative of the Dutch Council Presidency spoke before the European Parliament. In a session at the Industry Committee (ITRE), MEP David Hammerstein (Greens/EFA, Spain) accused the dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, of pressing ahead to legalise patents on "computer-implemented" algorithms and business methods within the European Union against the explicit will of both the European Parliament and the Dutch National Parliament.</p>
            <p>"The Dutch Parliament's motion to withdraw support from the preliminary political Council agreement of May 18th is aggressively suppressed by the Dutch presidency" says MEP David Hammerstein. "The minister representing the Dutch Presidency in the ITRE Hearing, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, did not seem to like the questions posed on software patents in last Monday's meeting. He was queried about the future of his position in favour of patents after the Dutch Parliament had voted clearly this July [...] Minister Brinkhorst responded in an ambiguous, noncommittal and even disdainful manner."</p>
            <p>On July 1st, the Dutch Parliament by a 2/3 majority passed a resolution asking the government to withdraw the Netherlands' support for the Council's software patent directive proposal and criticising Brinkhorst's ministry for attempts to misinform the Parliament. Brinkhorst however publicly announced that he would not withdraw support for the proposal. This has prompted a parliamentary inquiry from members of both the governing and the opposing parties.</p>
            <p>Tensions between the Government and the Parliament on patent policy have some years of history in the Netherlands. Even before Brinkhorst assumed office, the government used the EU Council to pursue a policy framed by ministerial "patent experts", while ignoring parliamentary decisions as well as a series of economic studies commissioned by the same ministry, all of which disapproved of this policy.</p>
            <p>In other EU countries, including Germany, France, Poland, Denmark and Hungary, similar tensions between the ministerial patent bureaucracy and national parliaments have come to the surface.</p>
            <p>The lack of democracy in the Council's decision mechanisms has been recognised for decades. One attempt at solving this problem is the Committee of National Parliaments in the EU, the COSAC. An annex protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty says that these national parliaments should be consulted by the Council and should have sufficient time (6 weeks after translations of proposals have come out) to give input.</p>
            <p>"National parliaments should have a greater say in the decision process of the European Union, especially when there is a conflict between the European Parliament and the Council" says <a href="choose" title="wikilink">your MEP**</a>. The Council legislates in very strange ways. Even we as <a href="MEPs" title="wikilink">MEPs</a> do not get access to their session minutes and working documents. We do not know who is pushing which interests and why. I can't see how such intransparent decisionmaking can be legitimated, if not by the will of national parliaments. Ideally speaking, the Council's diplomats should be loyal emissaries of national parliaments, nothing more. That's why the COSAC initiative is very important. The conflict on the software patent directive is a case in point. It highlights an urgent need for introduction of sound lawmaking practices in the Council."</p>
