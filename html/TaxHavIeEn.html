            <p>From 1991-1998, foreign-owned firms accounted for 95 percent of the growth in Irish industrial exports, and by 1999 foreign-owned industry accounted for an estimated 38 billion euro, or almost three-quarters of total Irish exports.</p>
            <p>Foreign direct investment flows into Ireland in the 1990s originated mostly from export-oriented United States multinationals. By 1998, U.S.-owned companies in Ireland were responsible for 70 percent of Irish industrial exports. Among the small EU economies, Ireland was by the greatest beneficiary of the large and rising levels of U.S. FDI into Europe over the course of the 1990s.</p>
            <p>While well-thought out government policies were the main driving force behind Ireland's "Celtic Tiger Phase" (1986-2001), a number of quirky factors are also said to have contributed to the country's remarkable development.</p>
            <p>One of them is that over 40 million Irish-Americans live in the United States. Though probably difficult to prove, both professional economists and general commentators have opined that many Irish-American businessmen invested in Ireland because of their shared Irish heritage, even though it was generations removed.</p>
            <p>Forfas, policy advisor to the Irish government, estimates that 77 percent of the value of total sales by Irish-based manufacturing multinationals in 1998 subsequently leaked out of the Irish economy through profit repatriations and imported goods and services, including payment of foreign royalties and licenses.</p>
            <p>"This means less than one-third of multinationals' turnover went into Irish economy expenditures, in the form of wages and salaries, purchases of raw materials and Irish services, and profit distributions," notes a February 2002 review of the Irish economy in local economic journal, Business Plus.</p>

            <p>With the links from my previous post it should be obvious that Ireland is a IP tax haven for multinationnals. Their interest is <strong>not</strong> to defend European <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a>. The Irish presidency sponsorship is not significant in itself but does represent real ties between IR and software multinationals.</p>

            <p>"Many U.S. companies, such as Intel and Microsoft, are increasing their participation in the European markets by making significant investments in Ireland. In the absence of significant trade barriers, in 1997, trade between Ireland and the United States was worth around $12.0 billion, a 19% increase over 1996. U.S. exports to Ireland were valued at $5.9 billion, an increase of about 6% over 1996, and represent 15% of Ireland's total imports. The stock of U.S. investment in Ireland at the end of -1996 was valued at $11.7 billion and has continued to grow strongly since There are more than 500 U.S. subsidiaries, employing almost 70,000 people and spanning activities from manufacturing of high-tech electronics, computer products, medical supplies, and pharmaceuticals to retailing, banking and finance and other services. As a result, the recent transition from a primarily agricultural economy is in many ways extraordinary. Ireland, once agrarian and poor, and short on natural resources, is now experiencing a software boom with a $2.4 billion industry employing more than 15,000 people. Some 40% of all software and 60% of all business-application software sold in Europe comes from Ireland."</p>
