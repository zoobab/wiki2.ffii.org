            <hr />
            <p>The Economist this week ran both an article and an editorial, lamenting the state of the patent system across the world, and urging reform. The <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3376181" title="wikilink">editorial</a> is available to all online. The underlying <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3388936" title="wikilink">article</a>, available to subscribers only, included the following about the current debate in Europe:</p>

            <p>INTELLECTUAL property is the cornerstone of the modern knowledge economy. But one of the main forms of intellectual property, the patenta temporary monopoly designed to provide an incentive to innovateis increasingly being found wanting, even as the number of applications soars at patent offices around the world. America's patent system has “become sand rather than lubricant in the wheels of American progress”, argue Adam Jaffe and Josh Lerner in a new book, “Innovation and its Discontents: How our broken patent system is endangering innovation and progress and what to do about it” (published by Princeton University Press). The world's patent system remains splintered along national lines, yet the system's defects are felt everywhere.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>The mission creep of America's patent system into more contentious areas is also spreading elsewhere. Later this month, the European Council of Ministers will discuss draft legislation on harmonising policy on computer-implemented innovations. Many small software companies in Europe, as well as “open-source” software developers that make non-proprietary software, oppose the initiative. They fear that it is a first step towards adopting controversial software patents, already awarded in America, which could block different implementations of the same features. Were further proof needed that this may not be an entirely positive development, look no further than the mighty software monopolist, Microsoft, whose chairman, Bill Gates, has called on employees to increase the number of patents that the company files.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>As these reforms <a href="to" title="wikilink">the USPTO</a> are debated, the scale and central importance of the patent system are also coming under assault. “The innovation system is broken in that there is too much emphasis on intellectual-property rights,” says Suzanne Scotchmer, the author of “Innovation and Incentives” (MIT Press), a book on the role of patents to be published soon. More than ever, she says, inventions that would otherwise go into the public domain because they are funded by taxpayers or charities become “cordoned off” by the patent system. If so, perhaps the patent system not only needs to be repaired, but shrunk?</p>
