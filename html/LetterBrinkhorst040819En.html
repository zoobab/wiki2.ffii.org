            <code>       The State Secretary for Economic Affairs</code><br />
            <code> From: Vrijschrift/FFII</code><br />
            <code> Subject: execution motion Van Dam 1 juli</code><br />
            <code> Attached: Change the vote Howto</code></p>
            <p>Dear Minister, Dear State Secretary,</p>
            <p>In the AO of june the 3d 2004, the Minister was quoted saying in the Volkskrant "The skulls of the parliamentarians should be opened to pour in knowledge about the EU."</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we must notice that your own representatives apparently also have difficulties interpreting the procedures correctly and as such do not consider all possibilities to execute the motion Van Dam. For example Mr. Nijssen, civil servant in Brussel for the Dutch EU representation, declared the following <em>{1}</em>:</p>
            <p>"The Council proposal has already been voted on, that vote cannot be reversed. For that, you would have to ask a new vote, and the motion doesn't go that far. The proposal only still has to be signed. We are waiting for the translations. But that signing is just a procedural matter. According to the rules you cannot deviate from a previous vote. It's a done deal. The Netherlands cannot retract its support now."</p>
            <p>In reality, all that has been reached is a political agreement, which is not binding and The Netherlands can redraw their support at at least two ways. And that is exactly what the Parliament has signalled it wants to do.</p>
            <p>Of course the Minister knows about the Protocol on the role of national parliaments <em>{2}</em> that came to be during the time the Minister was a MEP. This protocol arranges explicitely that once the translations are ready the national parliaments have 6 weeks of time to determine their point of view. Because many parliaments are on holiday now it is reasonable to lengthen this period by a couple of weeks. The protocol is an important instrument to lessen the democratic deficit in Europa and it deserves support and certainly no corrosion.</p>
            <p>During the VAO of july the 1st about the motion Van Dam about the directive for software patents, Mr. Hessels asked a question to the State Secretary:</p>
            <p>"Does the State Secretary see a possibility, when the second voting takes place, to submit a formal voting declaration in the form of a letter or a few words to say that she wants to be considered as abstain from voting? That is the position of the Parliament of the motion Van Dam is accepted."</p>
            <p>The State Secretary did not answer this question. Because we wanted to know the answer to this question too, we searched for an answer. We concluded that the answer is "yes", it is possible. Attached the "Council agreement reversal howto", wherein the possibilities to execute the motion Van Dam are described.</p>
            <p>A political agreement is not binding and the vote can be changed withoud asking for a new voting procedure. Just mentioning that the vote has been changed suffices.</p>
            <p>Considering the fact that this is what the Parliament asked you to do with the acceptance of the motion Van Dam, we urge you to use the possibilities that exist in order to execute the motion, as was promised by the State Secretary in the VAO of july the 1st. In the proceedings, we can read:</p>
            <p>"... and starting as of now to abstain our support for the current proposition of the Council. If a majority of the Parliament supports this motion, I am of course prepared to do that. In that respect, I leave the judgement to the Parliament."</p>
            <p>We also like to attend to you that on august 18th all 20 translations have been finished. Considering the period of 6 weeks that need to pass by between the publishing of the translation to the EP and putting the item on the agenda in the council <em>{2}</em>, the translations are therefore too late for the meeting of september 24th. Because many Parliaments are on holidays, it is also not unreasonable to lengthen this <a href="6" title="wikilink">weeks</a> period by a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p>Since, as far as we know, there is no further Council of competiveness before november the 1st, The Netherlands have the possibility to single-handedly block the current proposition of the council by simply adhering to the rules. At November the 1st the treaty of Nice becomes active and, if we counted correctly, at that moment a Dutch abstention suffices to break the qualified majority.</p>
            <p>Considering the fact that the Parliament was incorrectly informed on may the 10th, and the government used the term "common position" 8 times at july 1st, meaningful because a "political agreement" is not binding and a "common position" is <em>{3}</em>, it seems a good moment to adhere to the Protocol on the role of the National Parliament.</p>
            <p>We would like to be informed about how you plan to execute the motion Van Dam and when you think to put this item on the agenda of the council.</p>
            <p>In the name of Vrijschrift/FFII,</p>
            <p>Yours truly,</p>
            <p>Ir. Arend Lammertink</p>
