            <hr />
            <p><em>5 April 2005 -- The UK Patent Office is organising workshops to have people evaluate various definitions for the term "technical contribution". Below, you can find a report from someone attending the workshop in Glasgow.</em></p>
            <h2 id="report">Report</h2>
            <p>by Geraint Bevan.</p>
            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>The meeting was chaired by Roger Walker, a chemist/bio-technologist of the Patent Office. Peter Hayward of the Patent Office was also present along with a couple of assistants. Attendance was poor -- 16 people, which appeared to be just over half of those expected.</p>
            <p>As with previous workshops, there was roughly a 50:50 split between pro and anti software patent people. 550 people in total have expressed an interest in attending the workshops around the UK -- all were invited. We were assured that there were no secret patent office staff among the attendees!</p>
            <p>Roger Walker introduced the workshop, saying that the government's aims were to maintain the current balance: pure software is not patentable; computer-implemented inventions are. The government is keen to encourage European high-tech industry -- Nokia was mentioned as an example.</p>
            <p>We were told that there is currently no definition of "technical contribution", it has arisen as a result of jurisprudence.</p>
            <p>As with previous workshops, we were given 4 definitions of "technical contribution", against which we were to assess 5 case studies, hypothetical inventions which we were to assume were novel and non-obvious. We were divided into 4 tables for this exercise and invited to decide whether or not the cases were patentable under each definition. We were urged to try to reach a consensus, but it was not essential.</p>
            <h3 id="cases">Cases</h3>
            <p>The hypothetical inventions were:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Case 1: Control of traffic lights to optimise traffic flow.</li>
            <li>Case 8: Centralised printing services (including billing) for a hotel</li>
            <li>Case 12: A method for predicting moves in an online game</li>
            <li>Case 13: A method of allocating cell-phone bandwidth according to demand</li>
            <li>Case 18: Data structure to improve the efficiency of spreadsheet recalculation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The definitions were the current council text, the FFII text and two definitions drawn from a pool of twenty selected from over 200 suggestions.</p>

            <code> thus expressed."</code></p>
            <h3 id="general_results">General results</h3>
            <p>For many combinations of case and definition, a consensus was not reached by each table. After an hour, votes for the patentability or non-patentability of each permutation were recorded. The overall summary of the results was that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Definition A led to many question marks, i.e. a decision about the patentability or otherwise of a case could not be made;</li>
            <li>definition B gave fairly consistent results across the groups;</li>
            <li>definition F was fairly inconsistent;</li>
            <li>definition H was fairly consistent except for case 8.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The general trends were that definition A tended to make everything patentable; B tended to make everything non-patentable; F and H were mixed but with a tendency towards non-patentability.</p>
            <h3 id="results_at_my_table_4">Results at my table (4)</h3>
            <p>|| Case || A || B || F || H || Subject || || #1 || NNN? || NNNN || YYYN || YYYY || Traffic light control || || #8 || YNN? || NNNN || YYNN || NNNN || Hotel print service || || #12 || YNN? || YNNN || NNNN || YNNN || Online game prediction || || #13 || YYN? || YNNN || NNNN || YNNN || Cell bandwidth allocation || || #18 || NNN? || NNNN || NNNN || NNNN || Spreadsheet data structure ||</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Y: Case is patentable using the definition</li>
            <li>N: Case is not patentable using the definition</li>
            <li>?: The definition cannot decide the patentability of the case</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="comments_by_table">Comments (by table)</h3>
            <p>Each table then gave comments about how easy they found the definitions to apply and which they preferred.</p>
            <p>Table 1 was split with some preferring definition A and some preferring B. Those who liked A welcomed the fact that it allowed pretty much anything to be patented. As one patent lawyer said, he liked it because it lets stuff through the technical barrier leaving assessment to the novel and non-obviousness tests. Those who preferred B liked the fact that it did not make everything patentable. This table commented that they didn't like the phrase "pure logic" in definition F.</p>
            <p>Table 2 had a couple of people who preferred definition A. They didn't like the other definitions because they led to arguments over interpretation.</p>
            <p>Table 4 (mine) were unhappy with all of the definitions. We found A to be a circular definition which was not capable of defining anything unless the phrases "technical features" and "field of technology" were also defined. We were unanimous in reluctantly preferring B as the best of a bad bunch.</p>
            <p>Table 5 also found A to be circular, noting that it restricted nothing and was the closest to the European position. For definition B, they questioned whether "a field of technology" restricted inventions to a single field or allowed inventions to cross several fields. Peter Hayward assured them that from a legal perspective, "a field" would allow inventions to cross several fields.</p>
            <p>They also questioned precisely what intermediate steps would be permitted in the control of forces of nature. The phrase "forces of nature" was generally liked and understood to relate to physical things. There was some unhappiness with definition F because it would go beyond the scope of the directive and also exclude pure mathematics (!!! there were patent lawyers there !!!). They thought that H gave the widest possible definition.</p>
            <h3 id="voting">Voting</h3>
            <p>We were then asked whether or not we thought that each of the cases should be patentable, regardless of definition.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Case 1: 11 patentable, 5 non-patentable</li>
            <li>Case 8: 3 patentable, 13 non-patentable</li>
            <li>Case 12: 5 patentable, 11 non-patentable</li>
            <li>Case 13: 15 patentable, 1 non-patentable</li>
            <li>Case 18: 6 patentable, 10 non-patentable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We were also asked whether or not we thought pure software should be patentable</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Pure software: 7 patentable, 6 non-patentable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A straw poll, after some people had left, was also held to ascertain whether we believed that the current directive achieves the government's stated aims:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>7 no, it doesn't; 0 yes, it does; 2 abstentions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="what_next">What next?</h3>
            <p>The outcomes of each workshop will be collated and presented to Lord Sainsbury along with the Patent Office's recommendations after the final sessions on Friday. All of the definitions and case studies will then be published on a web site. The outcome of the sessions will also be made available, but not until the minister has had a chance to see them. It was noted that the general election may prevent disclosure for a while.</p>
            <p>The raw data from which the collated results are obtained will probably not be published on a web site because they would not make much sense to people who did not attend the workshops, but we were assured that they would be available to those who desired to see them to check that the reported outcomes are justified by the data.</p>
            <h3 id="further_comments">Further comments</h3>
            <p>After further discussions with the Patent Office staff, there were two comments that are worthy of particular note. Firstly, the UK government delegates decisions on UK patent policy to the patent office, i.e. it is not the case that the patent office merely implements the government's wishes; it also decides what those wishes are.</p>
            <p><em>Editor's note:</em> Peter Hayward from the UKPO, who is UKPO staff member referred to above, provided the following clarification regarding what he said:</p>
            <p><code>"What I explained at Glasgow was that in some European countries policy</code><br />
            <code> on intellectual property is handled by officials in Justice Departments</code><br />
            <code> and in others (including the UK) it is handled by officials in Patent</code><br />
            <code> Offices.  That does not mean that Patent Office officials like myself</code><br />
            <code> decide policy, any more than officials in Justice Departments decide</code><br />
            <code> policy.  Policy is decided by Ministers, as Steve Probert has already</code><br />
            <code> rightly stressed.</code></p>
            <p><code> Just to be complete, I suppose I should have mentioned that in yet</code><br />
            <code> other countries the policy is handled by officials in general Trade</code><br />
            <code> Departments.  There are pros and cons of all the options."</code></p>
            <p>Secondly, when discussing the impact of software patents on open-source software, we were told that many leading open-source developers did not think that there would be any adverse impact, including people from FFII. Unfortunately, Peter Hayward would not tell us which leading open source developer in FFII made such comments. This matter should certainly be pursued as it is quite likely that comments taken out of context are being used to misrepresent FFII opinion (perhaps unintentionally).</p>
