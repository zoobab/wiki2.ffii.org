            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 50 = 82 = 103 = 124 = 145 = 168 | Rocard / Buzek 11 | ++ | Wherever the use of a patented technique is necessary in order to ensure inter-operability between two different data-processing systems, in the sense that no equally efficient and equally effective alternative non-patented means of achieving such inter-operability between them is available, such use shall not be considered to be a patent infringement, nor shall the development, testing, making, offering for sale or licence, or importation of programs making such use of a patented technique be considered a patent infringement. | | 68 | Mann, <a href="McCarthy" title="wikilink">McCarthy</a> | + | Member States shall ensure that use of a patented computer-implemented invention for the development, production, marketing or use of a computer program product or service shall not be an infringement if such use is indispensable in order to achieve inter-operability of a computer program with other computer programs, unless the patent reads on an adopted standard from a recognised standard-setting organisation and the patent holder is bound by a readily enforceable public undertaking, provided in a timely manner during a standards development process, making a licence for the patent available as of right on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions. | | 67 | UEN: Crowley | - | 1. Member States shall ensure that whenever an interface is protected by a patent for a computer-implemented invention and use of that patent is indispensable to achieve inter-operability with an independently created computer program and is in the overriding public interest, licenses authorising such use are available on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions. 2. Member States shall ensure that implementing legislation complies with Article 31 of TRIPS. | | 63 | EPP: Kauppi, Purvis | - | 1. Member States shall ensure that licences are readily available as of right so as to permit use of a patented computer-implemented invention on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions when such use is (a) indispensable for achieving inter-operability between computer programs, and (b) in the public interest. 2. Without prejudice to any other remedies that may be applicable under competition law, the patent shall be unenforceable to the extent that such enforcement constitutes or contributes to an infringement of Articles 81 and/or 82 of the Treaty. 3. Reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, including remuneration, shall in particular have regard to: (a) the public interest in permitting open access to the patented invention, (b) the market position of the patent owner if that owner is also a supplier of a computer program using the patented invention, (c) the conduct of the patent owner in relation to granting, or refusing to grant, a license under the patent for such use, (d) the cost of obtaining necessary licenses from other relevant right holders for the licensed product, system, network or service, and (e) the generally prevailing business conditions, including distribution methods, and licence fees charged for the class of product, system, network or service requiring inter-operability. 4. No injunctive relief shall be available in respect of use as referred to in paragraph 1 unless the potential licensee has refused to enter into a licence for use of the patented invention. | | 25 | JURI 25 | - | 1. Member States shall ensure that licences are available to use a patented computer-implemented invention on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions when such use is (a) indispensable for achieving interoperability between computer programs, and (b) in the public interest. 2. The public interest shall be assumed in cases prohibited by Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. 3. Reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions shall in particular have regard to (a) the cost of obtaining all necessary licenses from other relevant right holders for the licensed product, system, network or service, (b) the generally prevailing business conditions applicable to that class of licensed product, system, network or service, (c) the R&amp;D investments by the patent holder. |</p>
            <p>Am 50=82=103=124=145=168 is essential to prevent dominant players using patents to perpetuate their dominance by locking out competition. It provides that if methods are needed for the sole purpose of interoperability, they should be available to all. FFII strongly recommends this solution, which is similar to the amendment Parliament adopted at first reading.</p>
            <p>Am 68 has some attractive features. It gives a strong incentive for patent owners to submit their technology to standards-making organisations; this would encourage better technical solutions and much more complete disclosure of interfaces; and the amendment would protect such standards from subsequent "patent ambush". However, despite the fine words of the recitals, many of such standards would surely carry licence fees, which would shut out community-written free software from being able to interoperate. FFII can therefore only recommend this approach as a last-option fallback.</p>
            <p>The compulsory RAND licence approach of Ams 63, 25 and 67 would in practice place a very heavy burden on <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a>, who would be faced with having to fight long and costly actions in court proceedings for the opportunity to participate, possibly in each one of the 25 member states, all under different rules and procedures. This is unrealistic; doubly so, in such a fast moving field as software. The RAND compulsory licensing amendments give the illusion of addressing the problem, but in practice their solution is worthless. FFII cannot recommend them.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 69 | Mann, <a href="McCarthy" title="wikilink">McCarthy</a> | + | For the purposes of Article 6a, "recognised standard-setting organisation" means a body, organisation or institution that produces open standards in the public interest and in which ongoing standards development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure accessible to all interested parties in accordance with objective and reasonable criteria. An open standard is a technical specification that is available for implementation by all parties interested in offering standard-compliant implementations. Such organisation may be constituted at national, transnational or international level and may be a government agency, private research institute that acts like a government agency, private volunteer association or private industry consortium, provided that a representative proportion of the industry must be involved in the setting of the standard in a transparent manner. Examples of recognised international standard-setting organisations include those listed in Annexes I and II to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended, the International Organization for Standardization, the International Electronical Commission and the International Telecommunication Union, research institutes that act like government agencies, private volunteer associations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, and private industry consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium or the Digital Video Broadcasting consortium. |</p>
            <h2 id="recital_20_b_new">Recital 20 b (new)</h2>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 70 | Mann, <a href="McCarthy" title="wikilink">McCarthy</a> | + | Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for the purposes of Article 6a means that the consideration for the licence must not be anti-competitive, exclusionary or excessive, taking into account the interests of all interested parties including the public interest in permitting open access to the patented technique for inter-operability purposes, the need to avoid prohibitive costs in the case of standards requiring multiple licences from multiple sources and the fact that the licensor can be expected to benefit already from increased sales of its product as a result of improved inter-operability. Fees, if any, should reflect innovative contribution only, and not monopoly rent or the strategic value or revenues deriving merely from an ability to exclude rivals from marketing inter-operating products. The licence should be irrevocable, and the patent owner must not pending negotiations or dispute resolution apply for injunctive relief against prospective licensees who declare themselves willing to accept fair, reasonable and non discriminatory terms. "Non-discriminatory terms" means that all licenses and licensors in a similar situation, including the licensor's own downstream business, if any, must have access to the technology on the same terms, so as to enable all to compete on a level playing-field, unless there is an objective justification for any difference and that difference is proportionate to the difference in circumstances. There should be no de facto discrimination between different development and licensing models, and the licensor should therefore offer, at least as an option, terms and conditions compatible with proprietary as well as open-source development models. |</p>
