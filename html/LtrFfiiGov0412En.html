            <h1 id="letterfax_to_government_eu_council_should_not_adopt_illegitimate_text_on_software_patents">2004-12: Letter/FAX to Government: EU Council Should Not Adopt Illegitimate Text on Software Patents</h1>
            <p>Dear EU Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,</p>
            <p>We are writing to you about the Council of Ministers' meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. The list of A items includes the 'Software Patent Directive' COM 2002/0047 (COD) on the "Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions".</p>
            <ul>
            <li>This list should not be accepted.</li>
            <li>Take action when the Council President asks for the adoption of A items (right at the beginning), and demand to remove the adoption of the Council text of the directive COM 2002/0047 from the list of A items.</li>
            <li>Support for removal may be expected from ES, IT, PL, AT, BE, LV.</li>
            <li>Options are to change the text to a B item with a new vote, or to remove the text completely from this Council meeting's agenda. Complete removal seems to be most appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The COREPER decision to release the Council working group's directive draft for adoption without either discussion or vote is illegal according to the Rules of Procedure of the Council of the EU and against the Amsterdam treaty regarding the provision of information to national parliaments.</p>
            <p>Reasons for Removal from the List of A Items:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>In May and again in early November the Polish government has confirmed that it does not support the Council proposal. The change in voting weights on 1 November means that the Council proposal now lacks a qualified majority.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the Dutch government has been asked by its parliament to withdraw support. This means that, even without Poland's abstention, a new vote on the current Council Proposal should no longer yield a qualified majority.</li>
            <li>There is no definitive statement of a change of opinion on the Council text, either from Poland or from the Netherlands.</li>
            <li>The new vote is needed because the Rules of Procedure of the Council demand a qualified majority at the time of the formal adoption of a Common Position.</li>
            <li>The Council proposal has been criticized by all groups of the German Bundestag as being deficient. In particular, it does not satisfy the demands for clarity and balance that a proposal with such significance must fulfill.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the explanatory documents for the Council draft were made available only very recently so that at the time of this Council meeting only half of the six-week period reserved for the consultation of national institutions will have elapsed. The urgent scheduling of a parliamentary special session in the Netherlands after the COREPER meeting on December 15 shows the importance of this consultation period.</li>
            <li>With regards to the content, the recently drafted statement of reasons will be found to be unacceptable. The Council text rejects essential amendments by the European Parliament, arguing that they are "incompatible with the !TRIPs treaty" or that they would not reflect "established practice".</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li><ul>
            <li>The cross-party motion by the German Bundestag groups counters the first argument by recognizing that !TRIPs explicitly demands protection of software by copyright, and not an expansion of the patent system to software.</li>
            <li>The concerns expressed both by the German Ministry of Justice and the German cross-party motion regarding the EPO's patent granting practice suggest that the "established practice" should be adjusted by the directive, not vice versa.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The Protocol on the Role of National Parliaments in the Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly encourages participation by national parliaments in the EU legislative process. It does not exempt the Council of Ministers. Accordingly, attempts to thwart the integration of the positions of several national parliaments (NL and DE) at this stage would be illegitimate.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Summary: Without a new vote and consideration of the positions of the NL and DE parliaments in the Council's decision-making, the current Council Proposal is illegitimate.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to adopt the proposal as it stands is incompatible with the Rules of Procedure of the EU Council.</p>
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
