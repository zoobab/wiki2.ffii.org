            <li>2006-03-08 After a Joaquim Carvalho mail in es-help asking for the Lisbon meeting with an Alberto reply, Suso informs about the Lisbon meeting in the portuguese list, as President of <a href="http://mesagalega.ffii.org/" title="wikilink">FFII Galiza</a>. Joaquim asked for to create an FFII in Iberia integrating the FFII people from Portugal and from Spain. Alberto backed that idea that matches with its previous proposals of not to impose frontiers: FFII in Spanish, FFII Iberian, FFII Iberoamerican, etc.</li>

            <li>2006-02-26 (es-help/ eboard) Hartmut shows in es-help the suport of the board to Alberto, and Suso shows in eboard that neither the constitutional proposal nor Alberto himself had not the support of the spanish people (Alberto: which "Spanish people"? Suso: All in the only one existing group of the FFII in Spain, and the consensual silence in es-help. Alberto: yes, actually, last times in es-help only Suso and Roman speak...). The flame goes to eboard list, and to stop it Pieter Hintjens, President of FFII makes a call to conciliation call proposing a meeting in Lisbon wich will be probably held between April 22th and 23th and to which he will assist together with the other active members of FFII in Spain. <strong>Both Suso and Alberto accept the meeting proposal in Lisbon</strong>.</li>

Alberto manifest that such a proposal called "of conciliation" doesn't move a milimeter from the original initial position of the Mesa Galega expressed by Suso, and, kindly ask to the Mesa to give an opinion about his proposal of Malaga point by point in a way to know in which ones there is agreement. The galician group of the FFII considers that has no sense to formulate opinions about a proposal tha was repeatedly rejected in es-help and es-parl, specially when it was proposed by <strong>somebody unauthorized to act as spanish public voice</strong>, when <strong>it has not reached consensus in the last seven months</strong>, and accepts to involve themselves directly in es-help without the intermediation of Suso. Alberto remembers that such a proposal has been backed by main active members of FFII in Spain in both lists and that <strong>the strategy of Suso consist in to "kill the messenger instead of the message" and to delay as much as possible the constitution</strong> of the FFII entity in Spain.</li>

Alberto proposes the following legal structure: 1) "FFII in Spanish" as an example of name; 2) legal association; 3) no frontiers; 4) democratic: 1 physical member = 1 vote; 5) build by physical entities (persons) and juridic entities (associations and companies); 6) legalized under the existing Spanish law; 7) hosted in any city under such law; 8) with elected representants classified by regional and matter issues. I.e.: Representant/s for Valencia city, representant/s for Valencia province, representant/s for Valencia region, representant/s for Spain, representant/s for Spanish spoken members (all the association), representant/s for companies, representant/s for public administration, etc.; 9) with internal and autonomous working groups if they want to be created.</li>

            <li>2006-02-08 (es-parl) Jordi Ferrando asks how to /organize ourselves as a legal organization at Spain, even with fees to profesionalize our antiswpts 'lobby'. The proposal is welcommed until the posibility of excluding galician and catalans is proposed. Then Suso says it is posible to any group who wants to federate the spanish FFII, but not valid to the spanish FFII itself, as a ierarchical draft far away the federative consensus. The discusion goes to es-help.</li>

            <li>2006-01-30 (es-help) Suso sends the galician valoration about the Alberto proposal. Alberto's proposal caused a great bad feeling at the galician group, since it puts the discusion about organic nature ante the beginning point, before the federative consensus.</li>

            <li>2006-01-20 Suso says that both things (to be statal and to be federal) is compatible, and to recicle the working about statutes, he proposes to create a local asociation wich will integrate the Federation later along with the galician chapter. Alberto proposes, to avoid nationalist problems, to constitute an asociation not limited by frontiers representing its members with electronic poll, where they come. He proposes that legal asociation, constituted where we want, is refered (not limited) to the hispano-speaker neigbourhood, iberic, iberoamerican, hispanoamerican, etc. Alberto says that there has no sense federalism limited to the spanish state borders, because then there will be regions/autonomies without representation by its few population.</li>

            <li>2006-01-19 Pablo sends a statuts models of the kind of an asociation. Suso notes that this kind of statutes excludes the galician chapter of a spanish chapter, and to avoid that is necessary a federal estructure. Pablo says that <em>the most logic is that if we make the asociation, it might be a statal one</em>. Meanwhile Gibus says that FFII is just created in France and joins the <a href="http://brevets-logiciels.info/wiki/wakka.php?wiki=StatutS" title="wikilink">french statutes</a>.</li>

            <li>2005-07-19 alberto has no confirmation of the intentions of Proinnova to legalize itself and focuses on financial and political-legal representation capabilities of a legalized FFII in the state. xavi defines <a href="http://caliu.info/" title="wikilink">Caliu</a> as a group of catalonian language users without a territorial identification; he does not see necessary to join Caliu in FFII but he can ask their users. Suso will ask the galician group.</li>

(Correction of Alberto: I haven't any interest in to restringe to anything, in fact, I propose taht any person that feels identified with the environment to which the FFII association will be constituted, s/he will be able to associate holding all voting rights. The idea is something like to make legal es-parl and convert it in an association of perons independly of his geographic origen.
