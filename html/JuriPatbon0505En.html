            <p>196 = 197 = 198 clearly state that patents are merely a policy tool which governments can use where they deem them to be beneficial to innovation and the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p>199 adds that patents are also there for innovators to benefit from their creativity. This "natural rights" principle is however generally not accepted amongst law scholars as far as intangibles are concerned, because such rules introduce artificial scarcity (with tangible property, scarcity occurs automatically -- multiple people can't simultaneously use the same physical object).</p>
            <p>200 is only a small improvement compared to the Council text.</p>
            <p>8 is a bit better than 200, but still unconditionally states that "Patent rights protect innovation in the interests of society as a whole", although this is not true by definition (only if applied well as one of the tools available to economic policy makers).</p>
