            <p>Just a few friendly criticisms of this swpat.ffi.org site itself. I mean them in the spirit of better furthering this movement.</p>
            <p>I believe the swpat.ffii.org would reach further, and more influentially with a look and feel directed to business, NGO's and government orgs, with solutions, howto's, whyto's. I say this after I directed a friend, working for a multinational software company to swpat.ffii.org. He suggested that the page looks too 'grass roots' and 'evangelical' to be 'looked at twice' by management in his company. He said it seems to be directed to 'activists' and does not give an image that exemplifies the fact that swpat's are outside of professional and even commercial interests (especially for smaller enterprises).</p>
            <p>In my own opinion there is a problem with both this, and also the language of swpat.ffii.org. I feel that the language the site uses is a little scornful, pessimistic and catastrophic (the language of those already lost). While this is often a successful technique to spur drastic action, it appeals to only those that <strong>already care</strong>. However, it is not the free-software movement that is influential here, and for this reason should not be swpat.ffii.org's primary audience. The influential are those voting in Parliament, analysts working for Member States, technology magazines, CEO's and beaurocrats. As it stands, the language of the site does little to the ends of the movement as an optomistic and affirmative endeavour in the interests of better serving the social, cultural and professional interest.</p>
            <p>While much of the language is directed at the real risks that unlimited software patentability pose, I think swpat.ffii.org should also offer itself also as a professional consultancy, as opposed to strictly an advocacy organisation. It should pronounce the benefits of a software-patent free Europe, as opposed to only the negative impact of software patents.</p>

            <h1 id="answer">Answer</h1>
            <p>- we got many different stakeholders with different information interests</p>
            <p>- <a href="http://eu.ffii.org" class="uri">http://eu.ffii.org</a> is planned as a new portal, takes time</p>
            <p>- I further improved the CSS-Stylesheet, nevertheless help is needed</p>
            <p>- there are a lot of ffii sites such as <a href="http://www.protectinnovation.org" class="uri">http://www.protectinnovation.org</a> from FFII uk</p>
            <p>- I am very optimistic that we will win the debate.</p>
            <p>- we don't represent Free software</p>
            <p>- main problem: proswpat does not need to explain why they are against common use</p>
            <p>- parts of swpat.ffii.org are obsolete, most work is done in kwiki.</p>
