            <p>Q: I would like specific examples of how software patents have inhibited or made more costly open source/free software development in the US (where they are legal). Can anyone provide me with some? - Struan</p>
            <p>A: In this you will find example given by RMS talking about an early compression program and more: <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-patents-lse2002.ogg" class="uri">http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-patents-lse2002.ogg</a> <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-cambridgeuni-england2002.ogg" class="uri">http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-cambridgeuni-england2002.ogg</a> <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-patents-westminster.ogg" class="uri">http://audio-video.gnu.org/audio/rms-speech-patents-westminster.ogg</a></p>

            <p>Azi: How much money is at stake for the players ? How much revenue do these patents generate for Alcatel annually? How many companies are paying these players royalties? What is the avarage annual royalty paid? With such huge sums at stake for such well connected companies, how will any of this actually change?</p>
            <p>phm: A lot is at stake for the patent arms of Alcatel and the like. These departments employ hundreds of people. Companies like Alcatel do not necessarily benefit on the whole. But their organisations have been adapted and feel they are on the winner side of the game. They are of course also politically well organised and keep reinforcing the game by regulation. But 1/10 of their organisational strength can be enough to defeat them. They are paper tigers, relying completely on political masquerading. The problem is that until recently not even that 1/10 was ever put together.</p>

            <p>Q: Any more news on the ruling on software patents? I understand that the council made a decision on the 10th, but can't find any information anywhere about what is going on. Anyone know?</p>

            <p>Q: What I cannot seem to find on the FFII pages is a list of which MEP voted for/against which amendment. Was the voting secret or open? If it was open, where can I find detailed results, to see which MEP needs further support for defending the amended directive?</p>
            <p>A: It is there, see <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/plen0309/vote/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/plen0309/vote/</a></p>

            <p>Q: Isn't it really convenient that while BBC News24 have finally covered the patents protests (albeit only on the biznews) that Microsoft have grabbed the headlines again. Contrary to what their spinmaster said on Irish radio today, the technology existed for years to protect content from porn-links. This is cynical headline-grabbing at it's worst. WAKE UP MEDIA -this stuff matters -or will it be like everything else, wait for the disaster then report? m mcweeney Ireland</p>
            <p>A: See <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/players/media/" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/players/media/</a> and edit the wiki extension to insert commented links to media reports.</p>
            <p>We are not against a particular player as Microsoft or a company.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Q: The originating page asks for support on these issues and links to a sign up page. Unfortunately after signing up with an email address a further page is presented which demands completion, asking for residential address and so on, and requiring a good deal more time. Well, not actually in my case as I will not complete two stage selling forms operating on the principal that now we have your commitment we will trade on it to get what we want. Make such requests on the first page so that people can see what you intend asking for. Even if it were an honest process, an unintrusive process, how many people have time for cumbersome web forms? If it is a case of obtaining lobbying data that would be best achieved by a subsequent email asking for cooperation.</p>
            <p><code>   Why is it done as presently?</code></p>
            <p>A: Our system is under permanent improvement and there are many inconviniences and unfinished concepts. Feel free to Volunteer.</p>
            <p>We use different systems parallel.</p>
            <p>I think many persons like to be very careful with personal data, so they shall not be oblidged to enter personal data. however for signees with membership status we need personal data. And it is more convinient for us to reach "local people" when regional action is prepared.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Q: Open letter to Europarl from an italian blogger whith knowledge about the telecom area:</p>
            <p><a href="http://blogs.it/0100206/2003/09/23.html#a1156" title="wikilink">Blogs.it: Open Letter to Strasbourg and Bruxelles</a></p>
            <p>A: Some more telecom-related cases would fit well into the <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/" title="wikilink">Patents in Action</a> documentation. Maybe some people at Telecom Italia will be open for these arguments.</p>
            <p>phm: I removed the text of the open letter from this wiki, since it only reduplicates the blogs.it text. Nothing against the text, it is quite interesting to read.</p>
            <hr />
            <hr />
            <p>Q: Can we patent any software which will make life of lawyers/politicians miserable, so they understand ?</p>
            <p>Some one please answer.</p>
            <dl>
            <dt>A: Patent the "online patent submission and search method".</dt>
            <dd><p>-)</p>
            </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>arebenti: It is more the other way around. Patent attoneys benefit from patents and litigation whuile they share no risk. There are a lot of patentable software solutions for patent attorneys.</p>

            <li>Software patents promote only one business model: Impose a private tax on market players, divert resources into patent filings and lawsuits instead of R&amp;D, perform litigation instead of innovation. This climate only supports megacorporations and oligopolists, it raises prices, slows down innovation, hinders competition, decreases variety and quality.</li>

            <li>It is easy to describe an algorithm as a computer-implementable method, the actual work is in doing the implementation. That's what programmers do. Therefore, the incentive must be for the programmer, in the form of copyright, without any legal uncertainty or risk of stepping onto patent mines.</li>

            <li>Software patents have not encouraged innovation, but have stifled it. Broadly known examples are data formats and communication protocols using compression methods: Stac (ISDN), LZW (GIF), RLE (JPEG), MP3 where patents severely affect interoperability.

            <li>It's like patenting truths to hinder others from making any use thereof. Logic is a system, and making one part unavailable demolishes the system.</li>

            <li>The hope for a genius rewarded by a software patent has no support from real business. Actually, software patents are spread out like traps for others to step into by accident.</li>

            <li>The key to distinguish unpatentable logic from patentable subject matter is a strict definition of technical contribution, requiring the use of controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results.

            <ul>

            <li>Explain that the US patent laws, the EPO is adopting, are designed to protect slave labor and not Intellectual Property. In order for US corporations to move production around between countries with cheap labor, they have to prevent their products from being copied by manufacturers in those countries and be sold into the markets. The US is putting pressure on countries to have the same patent laws. The US patent laws create market monopolies necessary to facilitate this use of slave labor, even for products that technically are not new inventions, but just variations over old themes. This is an attack on the work forces of countries that provide the bare necessities of a modern democratic society with a higher cost of living.</li>

            <p>you have so much good material here, but don't you think the site could do with a new look? it's pretty humble and unreadable with these washed out colours and huge fonts etc ;=) maybe we should get a web design team together to make it a little more appealing to the new reader?</p>

            <h1 id="proposal_for_updated_text">Proposal for updated text</h1>
            <p>On July 6th, the EU Parliament <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Ep050706En" title="wikilink">rejected</a> the software patents directive by a large majority. This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods. The Parliaments rejection is the end of the legislative procedure for the directive, which was initiated by the European Commission to impose the harmful and legally questionable practises of the European Patent Office (EPO) on the member states. A directive that would support these practises has been avoided, but these practises still exist.</p>
            <p>The problems created by the EPO's granting of idea monopolies remain unsolved. But the legislative procedure has raised public awareness of the issue. In addition, good proposals are put forward to provide a basis on which future solutions can build.</p>
            <p>While the legislative procedure ended up in a status quo, it has strengthened those who believe in a European innovation and competitiveness that does not suffer from suffocating monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods. The FFII will continue its quest for such a European innovation and competitiveness. There is no reason to stop now.</p>
