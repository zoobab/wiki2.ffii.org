            <h3 id="technical_contribution">Technical Contribution</h3>
            <p>|| number || submitter || recommendation || text || || 4 || JURI 4 || - || A technical contribution is present if technical considerations contribute to the solution of a technical problem. A technical contribution is not present if the subject matter claimed in the patent solely consists of discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers, or presentations of information, without limitation to new, non-obvious and technical subject matter that can be made or used in any kind of industry. ||</p>
            <p>This amendment does not really clarify or limit anything. The "technical considerations" are easily fulfilled, because the European Patent Office considers e.g.Â that if automating a known process provides surprising economy of scale benefits, it is based on considerations of how a computer works.</p>
            <p>The second sentence can be circumvented by merely adding the word "computer" to the claims, as the claim then no longer solely consists of "discoveries, ... , programs for computers, ...". It is even dangerous to a certain extent in that it suggests that the exclusion of those subject matters as such in the EPC simply means they may not appear on their own in the claims. Such a limitation would merely require a rewording of the claims, and not constitute any practical limitation whatsoever.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_11">Recital 11</h2>
            <h3 id="requirements_for_patentability">Requirements for Patentability</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | In order for any invention to be considered as patentable it should have a technical character, and thus belong to a field of technology. | | 60 = 92 = 113 = 134 = 155 = 178 | Rocard / Buzek 21 | + | In order for any innovation to be considered a patentable invention it should have a technical character, and thus belong to a field of technology. | | 5 | JURI 5 | + | In order for any invention to be considered as patentable it should have a technical character, and thus belong to a field of technology. It must also be capable of industrial application, be new, and involve an inventive step. |</p>
            <p>These two amendments have been judged compatible by the tabling office. JURI's 5 is an improvement over the Council version, by spelling out the full conditions for patentability. The coalition amendment clarifies that unless there is technical character, there is only an innovation, not an "invention" in the sense of Art 52 EPC.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_12">Recital 12</h2>
            <h3 id="technical_contribution_1">Technical Contribution</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | It is a condition for inventions in general that, in order to involve an inventive step, they should make a technical contribution to the state of the art. | | 55 = 87 = 108 = 129 = 150 = 173 | Rocard / Buzek 16 | + | It is a condition for inventions in general that they must make a technical contribution to the state of the art. The technical contribution must be new and not obvious to a person skilled in the art. If there is no technical contribution, there is no patentable subject-matter and no invention. | | 6 | JURI 6 | - | It is a condition for inventions in general that, in order to involve an inventive step, they should make a new technical contribution to the state of the art. |</p>
            <p>The JURI and Council texts makes the same error as the Council in its article three (contradicting both the Council and JURI definitions for "technical contribution"), by stating that the "technical contribution" is something inside the inventive step.</p>
            <p>The compromise states that it is the technical contribution which must be inventive.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_13">Recital 13</h2>
            <h3 id="no_technical_contribution">No Technical Contribution</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | Accordingly, although a computer-implemented invention belongs to a field of technology, where it does not make a technical contribution to the state of the art, as would be the case, for example, where its specific contribution lacks a technical character, it will lack an inventive step and thus will not be patentable. | | 56 = 88 = 109 = 130 = 151 = 174 | Rocard / Buzek 17 | + | Accordingly, an innovation that does not make a technical contribution to the state of the art is not an invention within the meaning of patent law. |</p>
            <p>This Council article again confuses the technical contribution and the inventive step. The compromise amendment fixes this.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_14_a_new">Recital 14 a (new)</h2>
            <h3 id="data_processing">Data Processing</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 7 | JURI 7 | ? | Data processing in the sense of the directive does not cover the identification of physical effects and their conversion into data. |</p>
            <p>It is not clear wat is meant by "the identification of physical effects". This would cause legal uncertainty.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_15">Recital 15</h2>
            <h3 id="technical_contribution_continued">Technical Contribution (continued)</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | If the contribution to the state of the art relates solely to unpatentable matter, there can be no patentable invention irrespective of how the matter is presented in the claims. For example, the requirement for technical contribution cannot be circumvented merely by specifying technical means in the patent claims. | | 8 | JURI 8 | + | If the contribution to the state of the art relates solely to unpatentable matter, there can be no patentable invention irrespective of how the matter is presented in the claims. For example, the requirement for technical contribution cannot be circumvented merely by specifying technical means in the patent claim. |</p>
            <p>Linguistic correction in the French language version.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_16">Recital 16</h2>
            <h3 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | Furthermore, an algorithm is inherently non-technical and therefore cannot constitute a technical invention. Nonetheless, a method involving the use of an algorithm might be patentable provided that the method is used to solve a technical problem. However, any patent granted for such a method should not monopolise the algorithm itself or its use in contexts not foreseen in the patent. | | 57 = 89 = 110 = 131 = 152 = 175 | Rocard / Buzek 18 | + | Furthermore, an algorithm is inherently non-technical and therefore cannot constitute a technical invention |</p>
            <p>"A method involving the use of algorithm" is the same as "an algorithm" (algorithms are nothing but methods in the context of patent law). Therefore, the original Council text is self-contradictory. The compromise removes this contradiction.</p>
            <h2 id="recital_17_a_new">Recital 17 a (new)</h2>
            <h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 9 | JURI 9 | + | Member States shall ensure that the description shall disclose the invention as claimed in such terms that the technical problem and its solution as well as the inventive step can be understood. |</p>
            <p>Fair enough, though this simply repeats a fundamental principle of patent law.</p>
