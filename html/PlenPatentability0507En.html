The <strong>technical</strong> contribution is the set of features by which the scope of the patent claim as a whole is considered to differ from the state of the art. The contribution must be technical, that is, comprise technical features and belong to a field of technology. Without a technical contribution, there is no patentable subject-matter. The technical contribution must fulfil the conditions for patentability. In particular, it must be novel and not obvious to a person skilled in the art. ||</p>
            <p>The JURI amendment has one small error: the word "technical" should be removed from the second sentence, since otherwise all new features presented in the patent claim are by definition considered to be technical.</p>
            <p>The compromise amendment fixes this error.</p>
            <h2 id="article_3">Article 3</h2>
            <h3 id="conditions_for_patentability">Conditions for Patentability</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | In order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention must be susceptible of industrial application and new and must involve an inventive step. In order to involve an inventive step, a computer-implemented invention must make a technical contribution. | | 45 = 77 = 98 = 119 = 140 = 163 | Rocard / Buzek 6 | ++ | In order to be patentable, a computer-aided invention must make a technical contribution. The technical contribution must be new and not obvious to a person skilled in the art. | | 20 | JURI 20 | +/-- | In order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention must be susceptible of industrial application and make a technical contribution. The inventive step is assessed by considering the difference between all of the technical <strong>and non-technical</strong> features of the patent claim and the state of the art. |</p>
            <p>There is a <strong>serious error</strong> in JURI 20. At the moment, the EPO considers only technical features in assessing inventive step, and discounts non-technical features, as established in the folowing decisions: Pension Benefits T931/95, Comvik T641/00, Ricoh T0172/03, Hitachi T258/03. (See eg the headnote for the <a href="http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t000641ep1.htm" title="wikilink">Comvik</a> case; or this <a href="http://www.withersrogers.co.uk/content/view/54/45/" title="wikilink">discussion</a> from a London law firm). If JURI 20 is accepted, it will destroy the requirement for a <em>technical</em> contribution; instead it would open patentability to any non-technical new business method, even when the technical implementation was transparently obvious. JURI 20 must not be allowed to go through in this form.</p>
            <p>This could be corrected with a split vote.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 21 | JURI 21 | + | The application for a patent must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. |</p>
            <p>A general principle of patent law. Adds little, but unobjectionable.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 156 | Panella, Bonino et al | + | Data processing shall not be considered to be a field of technology within the meaning of patent law, and innovations in the field of data processing shall not be considered to be inventions within the meaning of patent law. The processing, handling, and presentation of information do not belong to a field of technology, even where technical devices are employed for such purposes. |</p>

            <h3 id="interpretation_of_art_52_epc">Interpretation of Art 52 EPC</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | A computer program as such cannot constitute a patentable invention. | | 46 = 78 = 99 = 120 = 141 = 164 | Rocard / Buzek 7 | ++ | While products and processes in all fields of technology are patentable inventions regardless of whether or not they involve computer programs, the subject-matter and activities within the computer programs are not patentable on their own. | | 157 | Panella, Bonino et al | + | Programs for computers are not inventions within the meaning of patent law. |</p>
            <p>The original Council text summarises articles 52(2) and 52(3) of the European Patent Convention (EPC) in a way that does not clarify in any way.</p>
            <p>Am 157 is a clear exclusion of computer programs from patentability in the spirit of the EPC.</p>
            <p>The compromise amendments take care to make sure that only pure software is excluded, but no CAI's.</p>
            <h2 id="article_4.2">Article 4.2</h2>
            <h3 id="exclusions_from_patentability">Exclusions from Patentability</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | A computer-implemented invention shall not be regarded as making a technical contribution merely because it involves the use of a computer, network or other programmable apparatus. Accordingly, inventions involving computer programs, whether expressed as source code, as object code or in any other form, which implement business, mathematical or other methods and do not produce any technical effects beyond the normal physical interactions between a program and the computer, network or other programmable apparatus in which it is run shall not be patentable. | | 47 = 79 = 100 = 121 = 142 = 165 | Rocard / Buzek 8 | ++ | A computer-aided invention shall not be regarded as making a technical contribution merely because it uses better algorithms so as to reduce the need for processing time, storage space or other resources within the data processing system. Accordingly, innovations involving computer programs which do not solve any problems of applied natural science beyond the improvement of data-processing efficiency shall not be patentable. |</p>
            <p>The original Council text only excludes source code of individual computer programs, which no one wants to patent. Additionally, it codifies the "further technical effect" doctrine which by the EPO's own admission was introduced as a stopgap until the exclusion of computer programs as such from patentability was scrapped from the EPC.</p>
            <p>The compromise amendment states that improvements in algorithms are not enough to make a technical contribution, and that a problem of applied natural science must be solved.</p>
            <h2 id="article_4.3_new">Article 4.3 (new)</h2>
            <h3 id="exclusions_from_patentability_1">Exclusions from Patentability</h3>
            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 59 = 91 = 112 = 132 = 154 = 177 | Rocard / Buzek 7 | + | Computer-aided inventions are not considered to make a technical contribution merely because they make better use of data-processing resources such as processing time or storage space |</p>
            <p>This amendment codifies recent UK and German case law (improvement in usage of computer resources is a contribution to the computer program as such, not a technical contribution).</p>
