            <li>"field of technology" means an "industrial application domain requiring the use of controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results", and "technical" means "belonging to a field of technology" (makes sure that "technical" actually means something, that the EPO can no longer say that computer programs are technical if they e.g. make a computer run faster and in general that patents remain limited to physical inventions)</li>

            <li><ul>
            <li>inventions which involve computer programs that "not produce any technical effects beyond the normal physical interactions between a program and the computer" are not patentable. Problem: "the normal physical interaction between a program and a computer" means as much as "the normal physical interaction between a recipe and a cook", i.e. nothing. The EPO itself even wants to get rid of this confusing statement, see the bottom red rectangle at <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/text/index.en.html#ed24@A2" class="uri">http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/text/index.en.html#ed24@A2</a>)</li>
            <li>The source code or object code of a computer program is not patentable (4.1 (new) "a computer program as such is not patentable" + the Council's "whether expresses as source code, object code or any other form" in 4.2). This is useless, since nobody would ever want to patent something like that (you can protect those things for free and much stronger using copyright).</li>

            <li><ul>
            <li>This article was not entirely properly amended by the EP, but that didn't matter so much: this article is supposed to add limits to prevent pure software from being patentable. However, that is already taken care of by the EP's amendments to article 2. So this article becomes more or less superfluous in the EP's version.</li>

            <li>5.1: you can get a monopoly on a computer executing a computer program</li>
            <li>5.2: you can get a monopoly on a computer program on its own, if you also asked for a monopoly on this computer program executing on a computer. Note that "on its own" is different from "as such" in the Council's mindset: the latter means "the source code of one particular program", the former means "*any* program that, when run on a computer, executes something that the software patent covers". The practical result of 5.2 is that not only the usage of such computer programs, but also their publication becomes forbidden.</li>

            <li>you have to provide a reference implementation of a computer program if you mention the use of a computer program in your monopolies (a bit similar to demanding blueprints of technical inventions; without some source code, society gets nothing useful in return for the monopoly)</li>

            <li>in recitals 17/18: you cannot use patents to infringe on the European anti-trust law (another tautology, you are never allowed to infringe the anti-trust law; additionally, (intellectual) property law falls under the jurisdiction of member states, so European authorities are severely handicapped here: they must first show the infringements have a big influence in a field where they do have jurisdiction before they can take action; finally, there is no way there is going to be an anti-trust case every time someone files a complaint about being blocked by a patent from interoperating)</li>
