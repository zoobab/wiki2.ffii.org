            </ul>
            <p>"The question of patent law, also important for industry, particularly the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, was raised by several Members, including David HAMMERSTEIN MINTZ (Greens/EFA, ES) and Esko SEPPÄNNEN (GUE/NGL, FI). The <a href="MEPs" title="wikilink">MEPs</a> defended open source software as a way of offering greater access to technology for everyone as it cost less. Furthermore it was a way of encouraging young people to be innovative. Mrs Reding said she was very aware of this problem, which brought copyright into conflict with freedom of use. "Ultimately", she said, "it is a commercial problem and we have to reconcile interests". She reminded Members that the directive on the subject would return to Parliament for second reading after it had passed before the Council of Ministers." ---&gt; <a href="http://80.200.251.166/public/epmp3/29-09%20Reding.mp3" title="wikilink">20040929reding mp3</a></p>
            <h4 id="source_2">Source 2</h4>
            <p>DG Infso having been very involved (and critical) in the elaboration of the directive, and given rumours that the software patents directive would move to her future DG, Mrs Reding was questionned on this by the Green David Hammerstein (Spain) and by Vittorio Prodi (ALDE, Italy). She provided vague answers and could not elaborate :</p>
            <p>"It is the same old fight between those who want to protect copyright and those who want everything free ; I think the open source is good but we need to pay the authors; in May the Council choose to take a step forward, (...) McCreevy will be in charge, (...) the ball is not in the camp of the Commission anymore."</p>

            <p>The successor of Bolkestein will be the lead Commissionner for the software patent directive; he was asked 2 questions, by Heide Rühle (Greens/EFA, DE) Germany) on software patents and open source software <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a>, and by Maria Berger (PSE, AT). His response shows that he has bought into some of the common belief statements about the universally beneficial effects of whatever comes under the label "intellectual property", but may be more aware of the limits of his knowledge (and thus more open) than Reding.</p>
            <p>see also <a href="McCreevy041007En" title="wikilink">arebenti comment</a></p>
            <p>McCreevy answers regarding patents in the Written Specific Questionnaire:</p>
            <p>14. What is your attitude to intellectual property rights in general? Would you envisage action to assist small firms financially and otherwise to acquire, defend and exploit their ideas and inventions? What is your attitude to criticisms of the patent system (e.g. from the open-source community), and would you consider revisiting the European Patent Convention in order to take them into account (say by raising the hurdle for inventive step)?</p>
            <p>Intellectual property rights are a very important means to stimulate innovation and thereby enhance growth.Whether we talk about patents, trademarks, or copyright, the economic dimension of the sectors and industries benefiting from intellectual property protection in Europe is very significant and has enormous potential.</p>
            <p>Beyond the economic dimension, there is also of course the more qualitative dimension of our creativity and cultural diversity. The contribution of robust intellectual property protection to achieving the Lisbon objective (which, let us not forget, is about becoming the best knowledge-based economy in the world) is clear. It is also clear that innovation and creativity are at risk to piracy and counterfeiting.To best serve our economic objectives, intellectual property protections need to be framed not only with rights- holders in mind, but also consumers and competitors. They also need to be enforceable and enforced. It is indeed important that <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a> are able to benefit from such protections they are among our most inventive firms. Our job is therefore to design protections which are accessible to them. As far as I can judge at present, this should not require SME-specific instruments.</p>
            <p>For example, the adoption of the Community Patent would make EU-wide patent protection significantly cheaper and simpler to obtain and thereby help <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a> in particular to bring their innovations to market. I can only regret that efforts to create the Community patent have not been successful.This illustrates one of the weaknesses of the Lisbon process - lack of delivery!I am of course aware of the various criticisms which are made of the patent system. I pledge myself to conducting my policy deliberations in an open and broad-based way and to seeking balanced solutions. As for the European Patent Convention, this is of course an international agreement which is independent of the Community. As patent protection is of interest to companies of all sizes, I do not see that reducing its scope is the obvious way to make the patent system more accessible to <a href="SMEs" title="wikilink">SMEs</a>.</p>

            <p>"Die Innovationsfähigkeit und die Flexibilität der KMU seien entscheidende Faktoren und die KMU, das Rückrat der europäischen Wirtschaft, müssten in die Lage versetzt werden, den neuen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden."</p>
