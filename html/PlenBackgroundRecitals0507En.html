            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | The Community and its Member States are bound by the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994). Article 27(1) of TRIPS provides that patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application. Moreover, according to that Article, patent rights should be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology. These principles should accordingly apply to computer-implemented inventions. | | 51 = 83 = 104 = 125 = 146 = 169 | Rocard / Buzek 12 | + | The Community and its Member States are bound by the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994). Article 27(1) of TRIPS provides that patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application. Moreover, according to that Article, patent rights should be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology. This means that patentability must be effectively limited in terms of general concepts such as "invention", "technology" and "industry", so as to avoid both unsystematic exceptions and uncontrollable extensions, both of which would act as barriers to free trade. Thus inventions in all fields of applied natural science are patentable, whereas innovations in fields such as mathematics, data processing and organisational logic are not patentable, regardless of whether or not a computer is used for their implementation. |</p>
            <p>Removes the Council's incorrect claim that <a href="TRIPs" title="wikilink">TRIPs</a> mandates software patents; and clarifies that forbidding software patents can be easily made <a href="TRIPs" title="wikilink">TRIPs</a>-compliant by noting that pure software innovations do not belong to a field of technology.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | Under the Convention on the Grant of European Patents signed in Munich on 5 October 1973 (European Patent Convention) and the patent laws of the Member States, programs for computers together with discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and presentations of information are expressly not regarded as inventions and are therefore excluded from patentability. This exception, however, applies and is justified only to the extent that a patent application or patent relates to the above subject-matter or activities as such, because the said subject-matter and activities as such do not belong to a field of technology. | | 52 = 84 = 105 = 126 = 147 = 170 | Rocard / Buzek 13 | + | Under the Convention on the Grant of European Patents signed in Munich on 5 October 1973 and the patent laws of the Member States, programs for computers together with discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and presentations of information are expressly not regarded as inventions and are therefore excluded from patentability. This exception applies because the said subject-matter and activities do not belong to a field of technology. |</p>
            <p>Reinstate amendment made at first reading, that computer programs etc cannot be made patentable just by declaring them to be "not as such".</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | 2 | JURI 2 | + | Member states shall respect the provisions of this directive when acting in the framework of the European Patent Convention. | | 3 | JURI 3 | + | The European Patent Convention provides that the European Patent Office is supervised by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation, and that the President of the European Patent Office is responsible for its activities to the Administrative Council. The Administrative Council is composed of representatives of the Contracting States of the European Patent Convention, a clear majority of which is formed by Member States. These representatives shall exercise such measures within their authority to achieve compliance by the European Patent Office with this directive. |</p>
            <p>Although whether or not this provision is in our interest depends on the overall outcome, stating that the member state representatives who together govern the EPO have to take into account EU legislation and cannot simply do whatever they want, is a good principle to have.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | Patent protection allows innovators to benefit from their creativity. Whereas patent rights protect innovation in the interests of society as a whole; they should not be used in a manner which is anti-competitive. | | 53 = 85 = 106 = 127 = 148 = 171 | Rocard / Buzek 14 | + | Patents are temporary exclusion rights granted by the state to inventors in order to stimulate technical progress. In order to ensure that the system works as intended, the conditions for granting patents and the modalities for enforcing them must be carefully designed. In particular, inevitable corollaries of the patent system, such as restriction of creative freedom, users´ rights or legal insecurity and anti-competitive effects, must be kept within reasonable limits. |</p>
            <p>Reminds governments and judges that patents have both advantages and disadvantages, so care should be taken to make sure their effects are beneficial to innovation and the economy as a whole.</p>

            <p>| number | submitter | recommendation | text | | *** | Council | () | In accordance with Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs, the expression in any form of an original computer program is protected by copyright as a literary work. However, ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program are not protected by copyright. | | 54 = 86 = 107 = 128 = 149 = 172 | Rocard / Buzek 15 | + | In accordance with Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs, property in computer programs is acquired by copyright. General ideas and principles which underlie a computer program must stay freely usable, so that many different creators may simultaneously obtain property in individual creations based thereon. |</p>
            <p>The fact that the "underlying ideas" of computer programs are not covered by copyright is a feature of copyright which promotes competition in the free market, and not an "error" which should be "corrected".</p>
