FFII - The Netherlands

22 June 2004

On 16 June, State Secretary Van Gennip of Economic Affairs sent a letter
regarding software patents to the Parliament. Our conclusions about this
letter, which are explained in more detail in this letter, are:

1.  The text of the Council does not protect against an avalanche of
    trivial patents
2.  The text of the Council provides for patenting of pure software,
    independent of any specific device
3.  Unfortunately, we cannot but notice that the letter of the State
    Secretary contains much false information and contradictions
4.  Problems of the Council proposal, incorrect allegations about the EP
5.  Of the four goals, three are provably not reached
6.  Treaties are interpreted in a tendentious way
7.  The letter is also interesting for what it does not say
8.  There are more remarks to be made about the letter
9.  There is a general misunderstanding regarding software patents

## 1. No protection from trivial patents {#no_protection_from_trivial_patents}

Contrary to what is noted several times by the State Secretary, the text
does not protect from an avalanche of trivial patents.

The Council does not define \"technical\" anywhere, causing \"the
technical aspects of the invention\" to mean as much as \"the aspects of
the invention for which somebody could want a patent monopoly\". Johanna
Boogerd noted during the 3rd June debate that a strong definition of
\"technical\" is crucial, but there is none.

The only objective criterium in the text of the Council is \"novelty\".
All other criteria are undefined and therefore subjective.

The (generally known) problem of \"trivial patents\" is not solved by
requiring a \"technical contribution\". Something technical (regardless
of how \"technical\" is interpreted or defined) can be perfectly
trivial. The problem is more that the threshold for the so-called
\"height of inventiveness\" is traditionally (too) low in patent law.
Solving this problem falls outside the scope of this directive. (page 3,
number 3.)

The law quite clearly states that inventions must \"not be obvious to a
person versed in the arts\". If one takes those words literally, then
this is a *very low* threshold: after all, the \"person versed in the
arts\" does not mean anything -of course the reference point is not a
layman-, and \"obvious\" also does really mean obvious! The following
reasoning is also heard from time to time: if an invention is new
(another requirement for patentability), this means it is *consequently*
not \"obvious\", since otherwise it would have been invented already!
Patent law is only a hair away from allowing one to say that it very
clearly and literally allows trivial patents! This once again
illustrates that this directive does not change anything regarding this
acknowledge weak point of the patent system.

## 2. Patenting pure software is allowed {#patenting_pure_software_is_allowed}

The State secretary notes on page 9, first sentece:

` "Additionally, it is once again confirmed that software on its own,`\
`  independent from an application in a specific device, is unpatentable."`

Article 4a(1) excludes computer programs as such. This sounds
encouraging, but isn\'t. There is no clear definition of what \"computer
programs as such\" are. According to article 2, programs executed by
computers are patentable inventions. Martijn van Dam noted this as well
during the debate on 3 June.

As far as patent claims are concerned, the Council even goes further.
After all, article 5.2 allows for claims on literally \"computer
programs on their own\", if these computer programs are patentable when
executed by a computer.

Finally, during the debate the State Secretary gave examples of
techniques which should be patentable according to her: the (electronic)
shopping cart and electronic payment. These techniques are not part of
the physical operation of a specific device, but are executed on normal
computers. As such, this is about generic software.

## 3. Incorrect information {#incorrect_information}

Unfortunately, we cannot but notice that the letter of the State
Secretary contains much false information and contradictions.

In the previous point we already saw that the State Secretary claims
that the directive does not allow for pure software patents, while in
fact it does. And since this was already mentioned during the meeting of
3 June, and since the State Secretary appears to be aware of this error
given the examples she gave, we find this \"error in the word
processing\" very objectionable. It is plainly obstinate to fall back on
previous, incorrect assertions.

The State Secretary states regarding business methods (article 2b of the
Council):

` "As a consequence, business methods, that are non-technical in nature`\
`  and are just implemented using a computer, are not patentable."`

Since technical is not defined anywhere, they can be perfectly quite
technical. According to the EPO, they are technical if they e.g. provide
huge scale benefits.

Another possibility is using the backdoor which was explained by Ms Van
Gennip herself, regarding the double-click patent of Microsoft: if you
state that because of your business method less mouse clicks are
required, then this method is suddenly transformed into a technical
invention according to the Council, because you make use of a mouse and
supposedly improve something to it.

Regarding article 5.2 of the Council:

` "However, the Council text says that that program on that medium is only`\
`  part of the patented matter, if it is intended to be loaded into the`\
`  invention and exercise its function in there."`

Using the TV example: suppose you have a program that processes a video
signal inside a TV and that this processing is patentable, then article
5.2 allows that one can at the same time also obtain a patent on the
computer program on its own (without any context at all).

This article also causes the functionality of the program to be
monopolised as an object instead of as a process, which causes not only
the use, but also the publication of such programs to become an
infringement (just like a patent on a hammer not only covers the use,
but also the selling/distributing of such hammers). In this case e.g. an
internet provider could be sued for infringement if one of his customers
publishes a program which uses the patented technique.

Finally, the \"context\" also has very little limiting significance.
Nobody will ever ask for a software patent on a method to improve the
image quality of a TV, but to improve the quality of \"a video
displaying device\". In other words, it is trivial for a hardened patent
attorney to word a software patent always in such a way that all useful
contexts/applications are covered.

Further, the text claims:

` "Patent law that is generally in force however, considers three`\
`  requirements for patentability."`

This is wrong, there are four requirements: one must 1) have an
invention which 2) is new, 3) contains an inventive step and 4) which is
industrially applicable. Not everything can be an invention, such as
findings concerning mathematics and computer programs (as stated in
article 52 of the European Patent Convention).

Just like the Council does not see the \"technical contribution\" as an
additional patent requirement, but as a more specific definition on how
to assess the inventive step, the EP considers the condition of
\"technicality\" to be a more specific definition of assessing whether
or not something is patentable subject matter (all things that are
excluded from being an invention in article 52 of the EPC, turn out to
be not technical according to the EP\'s definition; this definition
comes from a.o. the German jurisprudence and the examination guidelines
of the EPO before it started granted software patents).

The State Secretary also writes:

` "The inventiveness of the invention must lie in the technical aspects of`\
`  the invention. Therefore, inventions which are only inventive regarding`\
`  the non-technical aspects, are not patentable."`

This is incorrect, the inventiveness can lie entirely in the
non-technical aspects. Article 2b of the Council proposal states:

` "The technical contribution shall be assessed by consideration of the"`\
`  difference between the state of the art and the scope of the patent`\
`  claim considered as a whole, which must comprise technical features,`\
`  irrespective of whether or not these are accompanied by non-technical`\
`  features."`

As such, \"the patent claim considered as a whole\" must indeed contain
technical aspects (that\'s what \"which must comprise technical
features\" refers to), but a computer is almost per definition
technical. A claim like \"a computer on which a computer program is
executed that does this and that\" perfectly fulfills this definition
and thus is patentable, even in the inventiveness lies in the
non-technical aspects (the software) of the invention.

## 4. Problems of the Council proposal and unjustified accusations of the EP {#problems_of_the_council_proposal_and_unjustified_accusations_of_the_ep}

### 4.1 Article 2 - Definitions {#article_2___definitions}

The reference to \"forces of nature\" as proposed by the European
Parliament is not ridiculous as the letter insinuates. In the German
jurisprudence, the application of forces of nature has been a central
criterium for patentability for decades already. In The Netherlands, the
High Council already decided in 1950 that (process) patents must cause a
\"change in nature\". The EPO also used a similar criterium in its
judgements until 1984 (until from 1985 on, they started granting
software patents).

The letter states:

` "All processes take place by forces of nature."`

The EP states that the invention (which must be novel, contain an
inventive step and must be applicable) must lie in a (consequently
novel) application of the forces of nature, not that that the
application of your invention must involve the usage of natural forces.
A computer program running on a computer is not a novel usage of natural
forces, because that computer was built 100% to be able the execute the
instructions in that program (so this is not a new, but a known usage of
forces of nature, regardless of how new the program itself is).

The EP states that innovations in the realm of data processing are not
patentable, because that is the only thing you can do with a computer
program. However, it does not state that if a technical invention also
contains data processing, it suddenly becomes unpatentable.

An example:

Suppose you have a completely computer/software controlled weaving
machine. You then invent a new way to position the knives under a
certain angle which enables them to cut the threads faster. The only
thing you have to do to implement this invention, is make a small change
to the computer program that controls the machine. This (how those
knives have to be positioned and moved) is perfectly patentable under
the proposal of the EP, because your (technical) invention is not the
modification of he computer program, but how you have to position those
knives in order to cut more efficiently.

The changes to the computer program (and possible mathematical formulas
which describe the trajectory of the knives) are however not patentable.
Summarising, one can thus say that software itself is never patentable,
not even when it is part of a technical invention. A technical invention
is however always patentable, whether it involves the use of software or
not (and one can also patent the technical invention + the software, if
one would want to do so).

As such, a computer program that improves a video signal by processing
it using some mathematical formula, is indeed not patentable according
to the EP, not even when it is used in a TV. In fact, there is not even
a practical difference between a TV and a computer monitor. This is
exactly the kind of software patents which are harshly criticised in the
US, and which the EP does not want to inflict on Europe. An improvement
to e.g. the electron cannon inside the tube (which can be
computer-controlled), remains patentable however.

It is further stated that:

` "Finally the EP proposes, with regard to article 2, via the amendments`\
`  38, 44 and 118, to reserve patent rights to branches of industry that`\
`  produce material goods. It is unclear what is intended by this."`

That paragraph puts words in the mouth of the EP and contains strange
reasonings. The amendments mean that the patent must be \"susceptible of
industrial application\", and that \"industry\" in this context must be
understood as \"the automated production of material goods\". This does
not allow for the conclusion that a patent holder must perform this
manufacturing himself and whether or not Microsoft produces mice (which
it in fact does do), is completely irrelevant.

### 4.2 Article 4 - Limitations {#article_4___limitations}

The articles of the EP here are more or less irrelevant if its article 2
is kept. After all, in that case the term \"invention\" from the EPC and
the term \"technical contribution\" from the guidelines of the EPO are
defined in such a way, that software patents become impossible.

The version of the Council however does not limit anything, contrary to
what might seem to be the case at first sight.

Article 4 bis 2:

` "Accordingly, inventions involving computer programs ... and do not`\
`  produce any technical effects beyond the normal physical interactions`\
`  between a program and the computer ... shall not be patentable."`

The \"normal physical interaction between a program and a computer\" is
a strange expression. Nobody outside the EPO talks about a \"physical
interaction\" between a program and a computer. It means more or less
the same as \"the normal physical interaction between a cook and a
recipe\": a cook follows the instructions in a recipe, just like a
computer follows the instructions in a program.

The EPO itself even wants to get rid of this unclear wording, and notes
it was only necessary while waiting for the exclusion of software
patents to be removed from article 52 of the EPC (this however did not
happen, which was the original incentive of the Commission to introduce
this directive):

` "This scheme makes no mention of the 'further technical effect' discussed`\
`  in T1173/97. There is no need to consider this concept in examination,`\
`  and it is preferred not to do so for the following reasons: firstly, it`\
`  is confusing to both examiners and applicants; secondly, the only`\
`  apparent reason for distinguishing 'technical effect' from 'further`\
`  technical effect' in the decision was because of the presence of`\
`  'programs for computers' in the list of exclusions under Article 52(2)`\
`  EPC. If, as is to be anticipated, this element is dropped from the list`\
`  by the Diplomatic Conference, there will no longer be any basis for such`\
`  a distinction. It is to be inferred that the Board of Appeals would have`\
`  preferred to be able to say that no computer-implemented invention is`\
`  excluded from patentability by the provisions of Articles 52(2) and (3)`\
`  EPC."`

`  http: //www.european-patent-office.org/tws/appendix6.pdf (point 1 under "Notes")`

The fact that the exclusion of \"computer programs as such\" is
confusing, is also noted in the following citation:

` "From the legal part of the study it emerged that the present ban on`\
`  patenting "software as such" leads to problems. The present statutory`\
` exception for "computer programmes as such" not only does not allow`\
` reasonable interpretations, but also in practice leads to a tremendous`\
` amount of arguments which is incomprehensible, not only for outsiders."`

` Micro- and Macroeconomic Implications of the Patentability of Software`\
` Innovations (Max Planck Institute and Fraunhofer Institute, 2001) `

This clearly demonstrates that instead of diminishing the legal
uncertainty and unclarity, the \"limitations\" of the Council only
increase them by insisting on expressions such as \"computer program as
such\" and \"further technical effect\". On top of that, from articles
4a(1) and 4a(2) of the Council, it follows that the Council interprets
\"computer program as such\" as the source code or executable (object
code) form of a certain computer program. However, no-one ever asks for
a patent on a certain computer program, but always on a certain
algorithm (e.g. to improve a video signal), since the written program is
already protected (for free and much stronger) by copyright.

Consequently, the Council here excludes something from patentability
which no-one would ever want to ask a patent for (and until now never
asked one for), and which as such has nothing to do with the problems of
software patents at all. In fact, such patents are not possible in the
US either. It does however demonstrate that the term \"software patent\"
is a badly chosen term: it is not about patents on software, but about
patents on rules for mathematics, presentation of information and
business methods. One can however only obtain patents on these
unpatentable rules, if one states that they are executed by a computer
(introducing so-called \"technical character\"), from which the name
evolved.

### 4.3 Article 5 - Form of the claims {#article_5___form_of_the_claims}

The claims of a patent from the part of the patent which stipulates on
what one wants a monopoly in exchange for publishing his invention.
Point 3 already showed how article 5.2 allowed patents on computer
programs on their own (and as such does not only forbid usage, but also
publication).

The request of the EP to publish source code (which in fact has the
support of a.o.
[FENIT](http://www.fenit.nl/template.php?itemno=5221 "wikilink")), is
not in any way a trade of copyright protection in exchange for patent
protection. One never patents an entire program, but only specific
algorithms (e.g., to quickly calculate a square root). One must then
only publish a reference implementation of this algorithm without
limiting copyright clauses, and of course this does not mean that one
has to publish the source code of each program which uses this
algorithm.

If software forms part of a patent, the availability of source code is
essential. The description in the patent offers little of concrete
value. Additionally, it is difficult to make a program unreadable in the
way that can be done using superfluous juridical wordings. In
comparison: patents on more tangible subject matter often also contain
concrete examples, such as drawings.

### 4.4 Article 6 - Interoperability {#article_6___interoperability}

It is strange that the Cabinet stresses decompilation so much, since
this term denotes the meticulous studying of the internal working of a
program to find out how it works. If a particular technique is patented
however, this should not be necessary at all, since all necessary
information should be found in the patent in that case. Of course, it\'s
possible this is an acknowledgement of the fact that most patents can
only be understood by juridical experts and not by software developers.

In either case, this does not help at all: decompilation simply cannot
be forbidden using a patent. A patent gives a monopoly on the use (or
production/distribution) of something, not on the studying of something.
As such, this guarantee is an empty promise. Additionally, if you then
afterwards want to use the patented technique for interoperability
purposes (e.g., to read a Microsoft Word document), it suddenly turns
out that there is no exclusion from patentability for such usage. As
such, this remains forbidden en you\'re left in the cold.

A few recitals of the Council (17 and 18) state that one can never use a
patent to infringe on the anti-trust law, in particular when
interoperability is concerned. This is worthless for several reasons:

1.  One is never allowed to infringe on the anti-trust law anyway;
2.  This concerns European anti-trust law, and (intellectual) property
    law falls under the jurisdiction of member states. This means that
    the European anti-trust authorities must first indication that there
    is a big influence on an area where they do have jurisdiction before
    they are allowed to take action;
3.  The EU is not going to start an anti-trust case for each complaint
    about interoperability problems;
4.  Anti-trust law is too blunt a tool (it took years to get a judgement
    in the Microsoft case, and will take several more years if Microsoft
    appeals);
5.  Interoperability is a basic building block of the informatics world,
    like the Cabinet confirms. One needs strong ground rules which
    explicitly guarantee this right.

The Cabinet justifies the removal of the EP amendment by claiming that
it violates article 30 [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink"), which states that
limitations regarding enforceability may not \"unreasonably conflict
with a normal exploitation of a patent\". It does not define what is
reasonable and what isn\'t, however. We think it is reasonable to allow
others to use a certain technique, if this is necessary to obtain
interoperability.

As a matter of fact, articles 7 and 8 of [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink")
confirm this interpretation is legitimate. After all, they state a.o.
that all [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") rules must be interpreted so that
they encourage technical innovation, do not conflict with public
interests and do not allow for abuse by owners of intellectual property
rights.

## 5. The goals are not attained {#the_goals_are_not_attained}

Of the four goals (noted on page 3 and repeated on page 16), three are
demonstrably not attained:

*1. Creating legal certainty in Europe by means of harmonisation and
clear rules*

See point 4.2 of this document.

*2. Keeping the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.*

This is a political choice which is presented as some kind of dogma. The
claim that treaties force us to do this is cannot be substantiated.

*3. The prevention of trivial patents by requiring inventiveness
regarding the technical aspects of the invention.*

Point 3 of this document demonstrates that the inventiveness can lie
entirely in the non-technical aspects. Additionally, the version of the
Council does not even define \"technical\", and there is no reason why
something technical could not be trivial.

*4. The preservation of the possibilities for designers to take note of
the computer-implemented inventions of patent owners so that via the way
of decompilation and interoperability they can design new software
products which connect with patented invention.*

See point 4.4 of this document.

## 6. Treaties are interpreted in a tendentious way {#treaties_are_interpreted_in_a_tendentious_way}

The letter regularly refers to obligations regarding the
[TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") treaty. Whether the obligation of article 27
to allow patents for \"inventions\" in \"all fields of technology\" also
means that software must be patentable, is however quite controversial.
Prominent juridical experts such as prof. Verkade and prof. Hugentholtz
do not agree with this interpretation.

After all, two conditions must be met: an invention must be present
(software, mathematical methods etc. are not inventions in Europe) and
additionally, the invention must lie in a field of technology (which
depends on how one defines \"field of technology\", since
[TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") doesn\'t specify this). Further, the
previously mentioned articles 7 and 8 always allow exceptions in case
the rules are considered not to encourage the economy or the general
innovation climate.

In fact, the [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") treaty even explicitly forbids
software patents. The WTO states on its website regarding article 10.1
of [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink"):

` "The obligation to protect computer programs as literary works means e.g.`\
`  that only those limitations that are applicable to literary works may be`\
`  applied to computer programs."`

Patent protection is not possible for literary works. One cannot work
around this by stating that this only applies to computer programs \"as
such\" and not to their execution by a computer, because article 4 of
the EU Copyright Directive regarding Computer Programs from 1991 states
that a computer program as literary work includes the following:

` "... the permanent or temporary reproduction of a computer program by any`\
`  means and in any form, in part or in whole. Insofar as loading,`\
`  displaying, running, transmission or storage ..."`

The execution is thus also covered by this. Additionally, there is still
the WIPO copyright treaty, which states in its article 10:

` "(1) Contracting Parties may, in their national legislation, provide for`\
`  limitations of or exceptions to the rights granted to authors of`\
`  literary and artistic works under this Treaty in certain special cases`\
`  that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not`\
`  unreasonably prejudice the legitimate of the author."`

The normal exploitation of a computer program includes the usage and
selling of it, and both can be forbidden by a third party if it
possesses a software patent on which the program infringes.

Accordingly, Europe does not have to fear international sanction, and
could even (if it wanted to) starte a procedure against the US because
of infringements.

## 7. The letter is also interesting for what it doesn\'t say {#the_letter_is_also_interesting_for_what_it_doesnt_say}

The State Secretary nowhere rebuts the argument that a \"computer
program executed by a computer\" fulfills the definition of
\"computer-implemented invention\".

A critical report of the Federal Trade Commission on (software) patents:
<http://www.ffii.org.uk/ftc/ftc.html>

Economists speak out against software patents:
<http://www.researchineurope.org/policy/patentdirltr.htm>

Dutch Companies speak out against software patents:
<http://wiki.vrijschrift.nl/VerklaringBedrijven>

The EPO and national governments earn money from each granted patents.
Te ability to grant more patents is thus financially interesting.

The quality of the patents granted by the EPO is declining:
<http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/legal/0,39020651,39157016,00.htm>

Software patents have an effect outside the software branche. Companies
with internal software development are hit as well, and also enterprises
with an online Internet store. The 30,000 already granted software
patents are mostly trivial and especially very broad. Een simple web
shop can easily infringe on 23 patents: <http://webshop.ffii.org>

In its opinion on the original Commission proposal (which is almost
identical to the Council version), the European Economical and Social
Committee almost literally burns the text to the ground:
[http://eescopinions.esc.eu.int/EESCopinionDocument.aspx?identifier=ces\\int\\int145\\ces1031-2002_ac.doc&language=EN](http://eescopinions.esc.eu.int/EESCopinionDocument.aspx?identifier=ces\int\int145\ces1031-2002_ac.doc&language=EN)

## 8. Additional remarks {#additional_remarks}

-   On page 15, point 3: *\"Then it will be clear to what degree the EP
    stays with its previous opinion \...\"* \-- During the second
    reading an absolute majority is required to still change anything
    (of the number of deputies, not of the number of voters!).
    Presenting the situation as if the EP still has a full participation
    possibility is thus misleading. The vote in first reading more
    accurately portrays the intention of the Parliament.
-   The State Secretary expects a lot from the evaluation possibilities
    (page 12). What can one expect from an evaluation? While preparing
    this directive, a lot of studies were already carried out (and
    disregarded). And although evaluating afterwards is easier than
    evaluating before, countless studies already show it is extremely
    difficult to get a grip on the quite diffuse problem of software
    patents. If we now open the flood gates, the harm will already have
    been done by the time the evaluation occurs. As the European
    Economical and Social Committee stated in its opinion regarding the
    Commission text: *\"It is hardly plausible to have us believe that
    the directive would only be a sort of reversible three-year
    experiment, at the end of which an assessment would be made.\"*
-   On page 1: *\"Without protection, companies will invest less in
    innovation.\"* \-- This is an assumption which cannot simply be
    taken for granted. Economical research shows that software patents
    have lead to diminished investments in R&D. An extensive overview
    can be found at
    <http://swpat.ffii.org/archive/mirror/impact/index.en.html>
-   On page 2: *\"I am convinced that, if we want to encourage the
    knowledge economy in Europe, the protection of such inventions must
    be done in a good and univocal way.\"* \-- The content of a number
    of important articles in the directive is vague and open to multiple
    interpretations, which is a showstopper for this goal. Whereas the
    amendments of the EP mostly try to create clear conditions, the
    Council text seems to attempt to create wiggle room for broad
    assumptions regarding the patentability of software, without clearly
    stating this.
-   On page 3: *\"The creation of legal certainty in Europe by means of
    harmonisation and clear rules;\"* \-- The legal certainty is mainly
    created for the owners of (many) patents. Whether the situation will
    improve for smaller software developers is another question, because
    of the risk that they could be using software-solutions which later
    turn out to be patented. A software product with some degree of
    complexity can easily infringe on tens of patents, and it is
    impossible to keep track of all these patents. The effect of the
    Council version of the directive goes a lot further than plain
    \"harmonisation\". Whereas currently in most member states software
    patents would be considered invalid, they would become valid in the
    whole EU according to the directive. The term \"harmonisation\"
    suggests that the situation would no change significantly on the
    whole, while in fact it would.
-   Further, on page 3: *\"Preserving the patentability of
    computer-implemented invention\"* \-- This formulation also suggests
    that the introduction of the directive (Council version) would
    change little to the current situation. In practice, the
    patentability is extended significantly and codified.
-   On page 14: *\"There is a discussion about whether or not the EPO is
    sufficiently critical when evaluating patent applications. If the
    quality of the examination by the EPO is lacking, the previously
    mentioned trivial patents can be granted. This is an unwanted
    situation which is bad for innovation in Europe. Article 8 states
    that the Commission will diligently observe the practice of the EPO.
    The EC (sic) can however not directly influence the EPO.\"* \--
    Exactly because there are doubts regarding the evaluations by the
    EPO, it is important for the directive to clearly state what
    conditions computer-implemented inventions have to fulfill. Instead,
    the articles of the Council leave much open to interpretation and as
    such does not offer abundant protection against the appearance of
    pure software patents and their abuse. See also:

-   Regarding article 4: *\"The in this article posed requirement of
    technical contribution must also prevent so-called trivial
    patents.\"* \-- The problem of trivial patents falls entirely
    outside the scope of this directive, and can also not be solved in a
    whim by stating that inventions must make an almost completely
    undefined \"technical contribution\".
-   By stating that a \"computer program as such\" is not patentable,
    the Council does not remove any uncertainty, since a large part of
    the discussion revolves around the question of what is exactly the
    difference between a \"program as such\" and a
    \"computer-implemented invention\".
-   The \"invention\" of Microsoft regarding the computer mouse: this is
    not about \"a patent on an improvement to a mouse\". Nothing is
    changed to the mouse. When you press a mouse button, the operating
    system on the computer receives a signal (that is the current
    situation as well). When you release it again, another signal is
    received. The \"invention\" lies in the fact that depending on the
    time between the first and the second sinal, a different application
    is launched.

This also nicely illustrates why the EPO considered the Amazon 1-click
selling as a technical invention: you click 1 time with a mouse instead
of several times, and since a mouse is a technical device, this was
considered to be a technical invention (reduction of the number of
necessary mouse clicks). This patent claim was not granted in the end
however, thanks to the fact that (fortunately) someone else had already
done the same thing before. Otherwise, we would have had bad luck.
