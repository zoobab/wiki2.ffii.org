*Warsaw, 16 February 2005 \-- Today 30,000 signatures of a \"Thank
Poland\" letter were handed over to the Polish Government at a ceremony
in the Polish Parliament. The ceremony took place during a meeting of
the European Union Affairs Committee of the Polish parliament.
Representatives of various ministries and members of the European
Parliament took part. In their speeches, they criticised the incoherence
of the European Council\'s current software patent directive draft,
which Poland is being forced to approve, and they stressed that by
objecting against the adoption in the Fishery Council three times,
Poland at least won the time needed by the European Parliament for
launching a restart of the procedure. The goal of Poland had been to
make sure that the Council would have to renegotiate its current text.*

## Story

More than 30,000 verified signatures from people all over the world were
on the \"Thank Poland letter\" given to Minister Marcinski today.

On December 21, 2004 Poland had [ surprised
everyone](Cons041221En "wikilink") by insisting that the EU Council\'s
proposal for a software patent directive should be taken off the agenda
of that day\'s \"Agriculture and Fishery Council\" meeting where the
item had been slated for debateless approval as a so-called \"A-item\".

The European Union Contacts Committee of Polish Parliament has formally
received the thank-you from programmers and computer users on behalf of
Poland as a whole.

Almost all Committee members were present as well as MEP Jerzy Buzek,
former (1997-2001) Prime Minister of Poland.

Government was represented by Minister for Education and Sport Miroslaw
Sawicki, Undersecretary of State for European Relations Tadeusz
Nowakowski and Undersecretary of State for Science and Information
Society and Technology Wlodzimierz Marcinski.

The agenda started with \"A-items for Thursday\'s ECOFIN meeting\".
After brief information about other planned A-items, the Committee
Chair, MP Robert Smolen asked for a status of the software patents
directive.

Minister Nowakowski shortly presented the directive\'s history, expected
developments and future procedural options. He pointed out that is was
not easy to block an A-item, especially for the first time in December,
and Poland did it three times and achieved its procedural goal: European
Parlament got time to procede with the restart request.

Minister Marcinski said that this action was possible only with support
from the whole parliamentary Committee, which twice expressed support
for his actions. Also the wide political support from all sides of
political spectrum was important. Restart is the best solution because
it will make possible to discuss and prepare new text in an orderly
manner.

MEP Jerzy Buzek thanked the Committee for its support and said that the
restart motion should be described as a joint initiative of all Polish
!MEPs from all parties. All of them lobied their respective european
parties to get such an impressive result of JURI voting.

According to Norbert Bollow, who created the thankpoland.info website,
the introduction of software patents would fundamentally infringe an
essential human freedom right, comparable to requiring politicians to
ask some big companies for approval before the politician is allowed to
say something in parliament. Even when only a small percentage of people
have programming skills or a seat in parliament, it is to everyone\'s
benefit when programmers like politicians are allowed to express
themselves in freedom.

## Outline

The meeting of parliamentary [European Union Affairs Committee
](http://www.sejm.gov.pl/komisje/www_sue.htm "wikilink") started at
12.30.

Almost all members of Committee were present as well as MEP Jerzy
**Buzek**, former (1997-2001) Prime Minister of Poland.

Government was represented by Minister for Education and Sport Miroslaw
**Sawicki**, Undersecretary of State for European Relations Tadeusz
**Nowakowski** and Undersecretary of State for Science and Information
Society and Technology Wlodzimierz **Marcinski**.

Agenda started with \_\_A-items for thursday\'s ECOFIN meeting\_\_.
After brief information about other planned A-items Chair of Committee,
MP Robert **Smolen** asked about a status of software patents directive
(no one in Poland is buying the \"computer implemented inventions\"
doublespeak).

Minister **Nowakowski** shortly presented history, expected developments
and the future procedural options for directive. He pointed that is was
not easy to block an A-item, especially for the first time in December,
and Poland did three times and achieved its procedural goal: European
Parlament got a time to procede with restart request.

Minister **Marcinski** said that his request was possible only with
support from the whole parliamentary Committee which twice expressed
support to his actions. Also the wide political support from all sides
of political spectrum was the important enforcement. Restart is the best
solution because it will make possible to discuss and prepare new text
in orderly manner. The main problem with directive in Council version
from May 18th is its convoluted wording and internal contradictions.

MEP Jerzy **Buzek** thanked Committee for its support and said that the
restart motion should be described as a joint initiative of all Polish
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") from all parties. All of them lobied their
respective european parties to get such an impressive result of JURI
voting. He shortly described the most important deficiencies of
currently proposed version of directive and asked Committee for support
in future efforts to get better proposal from Commission.

Wladyslaw **Majewski**, President of ISOC Poland, introduced Norbert
**Bollow** and shortly described history, goal and motivations of
!ThankPoland.info initiative.

Norbert **Bollow** gave book with !ThankPoland letter and 30.000
signatures to ministers **Marcinski** and **Nowakowski**. He thanked
them for their action.

Immediately after this item of committee agenda was closed all of us
moved to Ministry of Science and Information Scociety and Technology
building for press conference. Mr **Buzek** was present there as well.
Journalist asked several questions to minister **Marcinski**, Norbert
**Bollow**, and Florian **Mueller** form No Software Patents initiative.
