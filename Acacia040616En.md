According to Heise News, Acacia Research Inc has
[announced](http://www.acaciaresearch.com/pr/061504.pdf "wikilink")
another series of lawsuits, this time against cable and satellite tv
operators who are said to be using methods for data transmission which
Acacia owns.

Acacia also owns European Patents with a similar claim scope and has
used them to extort money in Europe. Especially Danish and Swedish
companies have been affected. They started from the porn web business
and then gradually expanded. [FFII
Sweden](http://www.ffii.se/ "wikilink") has a
[documentation](http://www.ffii.se/acacia/index_eng.html "wikilink") on
this.
