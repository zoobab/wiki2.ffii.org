------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Surveys conducted by the European Commission and national governments
have shown that, in the field of software and related industries, most
of the employment and tax revenue comes from Small and Medium
Enterprises* (!SMEs), *and that* !SMEs *in this area tend to see the
patent system as a danger rather than an opportunity. However, much of
the lobbying on software patents that is done in the name of* !SMEs *has
been making legislators believe the opposite. Various lobby groups with
vastly different backgrounds all claim to represent SME interests. On
29th of June in the morning the European Confederation of Associations
of Small and Medium Enterprises CEA-PME is convening a meeting that
should help shed light on enterprises with various business models and
on their difficulties in finding a faithful representation in the
current lobbying structures of the EU..*
