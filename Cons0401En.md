## Current Version {#current_version}

A lot of people keep asking where the current version is. Usually
pointing to <http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/> and to
this kwiki page is a good choice because we put a pointer to the most

## Contributions Assumed to be Non-Obvious {#contributions_assumed_to_be_non_obvious}

## Q&A

### Question

First part of Council Art 2b says:\'\"technical contribution\" means a
contribution to the state of the art in a field of technology which is
not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\' Can a contribution not be
obvious?

### Answer

According to recent EPO doctrines, which the Council Paper uses, the
\"technical contribution\" is just an aspect of the problem which must
be constructed as part of the \"inventive step\" (non-obviousness) test,
and this aspect itself is not subject to any non-obviousness test. The
EPO\'s recent guidelines even explicitely state that the \"technical
contribution\" itself needn\'t be new or non-obvious, and indeed that
follows from the approach that the Council has taken. So we have here
another contradiction.
