\--\> \[ [ Lobbying](LobbyEn "wikilink") \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outline of a guide to be written.

This page is, currently, just an idea, and the structure proposed below
is quick-and-dirty from someone with minimal lobbying experience. Feel
free to delete it in its entirety and rewrite it from scratch.

### How to dress {#how_to_dress}

Your cloth must be something you feel confortable with as you wear it
for the day, maybe under stress. Also the way you dress might be
different depending on wich MEP you want to meet.

### What to have with you {#what_to_have_with_you}

-   Printed version of the most important documents that you are ready
    to give away (giving an URL will not work).
-   Your ID card (see next point)
-   Paper and Pen (to take fresh notes after your meeting and report)

### How to enter the Parliament {#how_to_enter_the_parliament}

-   You must have an ID to enter the Parliament.
-   Only someone with a \"blue badge\" (Civil Servant, Political Staff,
    Assistant or MEP can let you in)
-   You will get a white \"visitor\" badge valid for the day, however
    you are suppose to stick with the assistant that let you in.
    Security guard are arround and check badge that should be wear
    visibly. It is best avoid the Bridge between PHS and ASP (stick with
    ASP building where the MEP and the food is) if you are not escorted.
