The German Ministry of Justice has issued a press release discussing
today\'s events in Brussels, in which it signals openness toward further
improvements of the Council\'s position. So far the position of the
ministry has been to insist on the political agreement of 18th of May
and to relegate everything else to the later stages of the co-decision
procedure. This is not really a departure from that but leaves
everything open for interpretation.

At the request of Poland, the EU presidency today adjourned the
ratification of its Common Position on a draft directive on the
patentability of computer-implemented inventions. Poland had expressed a
need for further consultations. On 18 May 2004, the EU Competitiveness
Council had politically agreed upon a common position on the EU
Commission\'s draft directive, which was slated to be finally ratified
today.

Germany\'s federal minister of justice, Brigitte Zypries, said: \"The
German government had already achieved a lot with the political
agreement in May. Nonetheless, we were well aware that the respective
compromise also has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of
arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European
Parliament. We will continue to work constructively toward finding a
solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the
decision taken in May of this year. In that process, we will also
introduce the position meanwhiled formulated by the German parliament
(Bundestag) into the discussion in the Council.\"
