*What will happen next in with Regard to Software Patents, in particular
the EU directive project? What is up in India, Australia? at WIPO, WSIS?
FFII & friends try to keep this page up to date.*

## Software patents, as a back door in the Community Patent Directive? {#software_patents_as_a_back_door_in_the_community_patent_directive}

After failing to push through software patents with the CII-directive,
using EPO-newspeak, the commission has reawakened the community patent
directive. This now comes with a a dangerous twist: That the new court
should use the EPO-praxis on software patents.

-   2005-06-20/2005-06-21? JURI vote
-   2005-07-06? Plenary vote. EP rejected the directive.

### Council

The [ software patent agreement of 2004-05-18](Cons040518En "wikilink")
did no longer enjoy the support of a legitimated majority of
governments, but it has been pushed thru the Council nevertheless. The
FFII asked [ 23 Questions](LtrFfiiCons050308En "wikilink"), to which one
member received a written response which did not answer them and thereby
only strengthened the impression of illegality. [ Investigation and
Commemoration of the Council\'s Adoption Farce of
2005-03-07](Eu0307En "wikilink") will have to continue.

## USA

-   Patent reform act in Congress (little impact on subject matter,
    mainly procedural issues)

## Indian Government Ordinance {#indian_government_ordinance}

Change with regard to software patents stopped for the time being, but
granting of software patents in India not stopped.

## Australia-USA Free Trade Agreement {#australia_usa_free_trade_agreement}

The AUSFTA will be used to push the limits of patentability or to
legitimate caselaw created by the patent judiciary.
