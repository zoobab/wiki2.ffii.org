## Patents

-   [2005-05 Shoring up rights to technology inventions - EU
    style](http://www.it-analysis.com/article.php?articleid=12700 "wikilink")
    -   -   opponents are \"the open source movement\", a similar
            adocacy group like the
            [FSA](http://swpat.ffii.org/gasnu/fsa/index.en.html "wikilink")
        -   \"The Open Source movement asserts that the EU Directive
            would stifle invention and developments. This is only an
            assertion or, put more gently, a prediction, as there are no
            historical facts to support the assertion. In turn, it is
            argued, it would lead to patenting of all inventions such as
            discoveries, mathematical formulae, rules, methods and
            business processes.\"
        -   Perhaps, if the patenting process could be simplified
            through legal reform, streamlining the processes and
            reductions in registration costs, the Open Source movement
            may be persuaded to encourage inventors and innovators of
            all shapes and sizes.
