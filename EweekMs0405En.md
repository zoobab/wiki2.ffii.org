An [article in
E-Week](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1566299,00.asp "wikilink")
says that Microsoft has lost billions through patent lawsuits in recent
years but meanwhile has built a sizeable patent portfolio which is has
been growing by 3 patents per week for the last few years and has now
reached a speed of 10 patents per day. The purpose of these patents,
according to the article, is to prevent interoperation with Microsoft\'s
next operating system version.

Microsoft is a [sponsor of the Irish EU
