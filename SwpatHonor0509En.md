Since the rejection of the EU Council\'s un-common position on software
patents by the European Parliament on 6 July 2005, juries and editorial
staffs have recognized our efforts in the form of listings on certain
rankings as well as nominations for awards:

While the FFII and !NoSoftwarePatents.com jointly received the CNET
award, other juries have decided to pick me personally as a
representative of our movement. In choosing a single individual, they
may only have observed the written or unwritten rules of the respective
awards and rankings.

I feel honored and uneasy at the same time. It has certainly been my
objective to make an impact on the software patent debate and on
political decisions. However, that has not been a solo accomplishment.
Without the FFII, I wouldn\'t have been able to prevent the legalization
of software patents through the proposed directive. If it weren\'t for
the FFII, I probably wouldn\'t even have become involved in the
controversy over software patents. In fact, the FFII and I wouldn\'t
have been able to do it without other organizations, committed citizens,
corporate supporters, and political allies in parliaments and
governments.

Instead of selecting me, the juries could have named Hartmut Pilch, and
I would have accepted that decision. Hartmut understood the software
patent issue years before I entered the debate. Without Hartmut, there
would be no FFII. Without him, the pro-swpat forces in the patent
bureaucracy would most likely have succeeded five years ago in modifying
the European Patent Convention (deleting the exclusion of computer
programs from the scope of patentability).

Let\'s respect the choices made by the juries, and let\'s make the best
out of the opportunity in front of us: to heighten the profile of the
anti-swpat cause by winning the EU Campaigner of the Year or overall
European of the Year award. That victory would belong to all of us
together. I said so right after my nomination, I have repeated it here,
and I will make it absolutely clear in the event that I do get to win
one of those awards on 29 November 2005. I would only win such an award
as a representative of our cause. I have also promised to designate the
FFII as the recipient of the prize money, which would indirectly
represent a donation of the world\'s largest software company (which
sponsors the EV50 awards) to the FFII.

From a strategic perspective, the exposure that I personally receive is
beneficial to our cause. I have already written about 60% of the
manuscript of my book on our successful fight against the proposed
software patent directive. That book is likely to be published within
about eight weeks. The book makes it perfectly clear how important the
contributions made by many key FFII players were.
