*Analyst Bob* !McDowall *of Bloor Research has published an essay in
favour of software patenting using a dialectical writing style. He does
not actually provide any evidence for the beneficiality of software
patents, but rather dismisses arguments against the Council\'s proposal
by reversing the burden of proof in favor of the \"established
practise\" of the European Patent Office. He further narrows down the
debate to \"open source vs patents\" and claims that open source
software is not adversely affected, since it is backed by big companies
who are successfully using software patents. To address widespread
discontent, he proposes some procedural reforms. FFII takes this text as
another opportunity to refute a standard set of popular errors, which in
this case are advanced in the name of science.*

    inventions - EU
    style](http://www.it-analysis.com/article.php?articleid=12700 "wikilink")

## Analysis and Rebuttal {#analysis_and_rebuttal}

The dialectical writing style makes it difficult to reject the reasoning
as the flaws are inherent part of the reasoning style. Arguments are
raised and mentioned but the author sets certain spin that leads to
misinterpretation. Wikipedia
[explains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic "wikilink"): Broadly
speaking, a dialectic is an exchange of propositions (theses) and
counter-propositions (antitheses) resulting in a disagreement.

-   The title \"Shoring up rights to technology inventions\" suggests
    that software were a \"field of technology\" as this is the very
    content of the article. Field of Technology is a term also used
    within the directive. Bob !McDowall later advocates in favour of
    software patenting using the argument that patents are available for
    classical inventions in fields of technology. However, it is
    impossible to draw a conclusion from that for other field, esp. when
    they are no \"field of technology\" in the sense of patent law.
-   The author sums up opponents of software patenting as the \"open
    source movement\", similar to earlier imaginative advocacy group
    like the
    [FSA](http://swpat.ffii.org/gasnu/fsa/index.en.html "wikilink").
    This rhetoric pattern enables him to set spin on what this advocacy
    movement stands for, and reject the opinions, thus undermining the
    position of real advocacy groups which share a far more
    sophisticated view.
-   \"The Open Source movement asserts that the EU Directive would
    stifle invention and developments. This is only an assertion or, put
    more gently, a prediction, as there are no historical facts to
    support the assertion. In turn, it is argued, it would lead to
    patenting of all inventions such as discoveries, mathematical
    formulae, rules, methods and business processes.\"
    -   -   The author here reverses the burden of proof of the patent
            system which lies upon those who want to apply the
            instrument to the field of software. Asserts that software
            patenting stifles innovation (!= invention) in the software
            industry only further weaken the case for software
            patenting. There are [numerous scientific
            studies](http://swpat.ffii.org/vreji/mirror/impact/index.en.html "wikilink")
            and negative experiences from the United States. He calls it
            a \"prediction, as there are no historical facts to support
            the assertion.\". Generally patent law has two different
            effects, a slower diffusion of innovation and an alleged
            incentive effect for stimulating innovation. For the latter
            effect empirical evidence is needed that it really takes
            place. If it does not, the first effect will predominate.
        -   He depicts opponents of software patenting as opponents of
            the EU Directive. But in fact advocates of software
            patenting such as EICTA rejected the Parliament\'s 1st
            reading directive, while many national Parliaments, FFII
            etc. reject the recent Council changes to the directive.
        -   \"discoveries, mathematical formulae, rules, methods and
            business processes\" are **no inventions** according to EPC
            52(2). Players such as FFII only insisted that weakening
            limitations of patent law leads to a slippery slope of
            patent law extention. When one wall breaks the flood the
            patent system out of control will grab for the next area by
            legalistic arguments. There is no huge step from software
            patente to patenting of computer-implemented business
            methods and then business methods in general.
        -   \"In turn, it is argued,\" **Who** argues it? The advocacy
            groups described by [MacDowell](MacDowell "wikilink") as the
            \"Open Source movement\"?
-   \"It is stated, correctly, that patenting is a costly and prolonged
    process. Patenting is beyond the financial capacity of individuals
    and small companies; it benefits large corporations, its patent
    agents and the legal profession. However, patenting is the
    conventional and accepted form of protection for most forms of
    technology invention:\"
    -   -   Patent law is designed for those technical fields, there is
            no need for application of the patent system to the
            non-technical field of software as software is already
            similarly protected by copyright. The scope of patent law
            has to be set by an economic rationale.
        -   There is no evidence that a market rule which allows
            software patenting **benefits** large corporations. All that
            can be supported is a competitive disadvantage for SME and
            the erection of an artificial market entrance barrier which
            will drive costs up.
        -   Yes, patent law benefits special patent agents and some
            legal professionals. These are the economic interests in
            favour of patenting.
-   \"Perhaps, if the patenting process could be simplified through
    legal reform, streamlining the processes and reductions in
    registration costs, the Open Source movement may be persuaded to
    encourage inventors and innovators of all shapes and sizes.\"
    -   -   The patent system is an incentive system that does not suit
            the software market needs and offers protection for the
            wrong object. There is no need to apply an inappropriate
            tool.
