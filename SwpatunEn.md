## Summary

Agencies of the United Nations are traditionally strongholds of the
patent lobby, especially in WIPO. Treaties signed between governmental
patent movement activists at the UN level are used to preempt
legislative discussions at the national (more democratic) levels.

This may be slowly changing due to a growing presence of the \"civil
society\" (non-governmental organisations) at the sessions of the UN
organisations (mostly in Geneva) and due to the activities of some
developing countries who have been resisting the patent movement\'s
agenda.
