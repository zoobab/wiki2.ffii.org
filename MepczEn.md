# A very brief overview of Czech EP representatives (FIXME) {#a_very_brief_overview_of_czech_ep_representatives_fixme}

ODS (The Civic Democratic Party) won 2004 Czech votes to EP. It is a
right-wing party which is currently in opposition in the national Czech
parliament. Members of this party have often criticised bureaucracy in
the EU. All 9 members of this party belong to Group of the European
People\'s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fractions.
They have one seat in the JURI (Jaroslav Zverina).

The Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People\'s Party, a member
of coalition in the Czech Parliament, has gained 2 seats. It is a
right-center party. Their [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") are in Group of the
European People\'s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.

The Social Democratic Party, the chief party of Czech government, has
gained only 2 seats. Richard Falbr is a former chairman of Czech labour
union and (judging from his speeches and commentaries in Czech media)
should be open to discussion. Both [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") are members
of the Socialist Group.

The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia has gained 6 seats. Their
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") belong to the Confederal Group of the European
United Left - Nordic Green Left group. They have one seat in the JURI
(Daniel Stroz).

There are 3 [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") belonging to European Democrats
(FIXME: There is a difference between Association of Independents -
European Democrats and European Democrats, but I can\'t recall the
details) who are in the Group of the European People\'s Party (Christian
Democrats) and European Democrats.

Two representatives of the Czech Republic are a bit difficult to
analyse. Jana Bobosikova (Non-Attached Members) and Vladimir Zelezny
(Independence/Democracy Group) used to be important figures in the Czech
media. Mr. Zelezny is a former director of largest Czech private TV,
where Mrs. Bobosikova used to host political discussions. I have no idea
what their position towards patents is.

I can only guess what are the relationships between the
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") and Czech government, but communication probably
isn\'t ideal, noting the low number of government
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink").
