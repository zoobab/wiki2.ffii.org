*The patent laws of most South American countries have been modelled on
the European Patent Convention, and we can expect the movement for
misinterpretation of Article 52 of that Convention to have its parallels
in Brazil, possibly going through without anybody noticing. On the other
hand there is a strong climate in favor of free information
infrastructures in Brazil. This is only guessing, we need to document
more.*
