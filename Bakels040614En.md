------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a summary of a presentation delivered by [ Reinier
Bakels](ReinierBakelsEn "wikilink") to the people in charge of patent
policy at the dutch ministry of ecnomics in connection with the
Parliament\'s recent questioning of the ministry\'s behaviour on the
software patent directive.

### Specific

-   In the version of the Council, there is no definition of
    \"technical\", which completely undermines all limitations.
-   The problems with trivial patents lie outside the scope of this
    directive. The juridical condition that inventions only must \"not
    be obvious to a person skilled in the art\" remains applicable.
-   Business methods which are not implemented in computers also lie
    outside the scope of this directive. Americans strive towards no
    longer patenting \"abstract business methods\", but only
    \"computer-implemented business methods\". The directive proposal
    will obtain exactly the reverse: it rewards vague formulations of
    patent applications.
-   The concept of a \"(technical) contribution\" is in contradiction
    with the system of patent law en thus will lead to a lot of
    confusion.

### More general {#more_general}

-   Misconceptions
    -   -   \"Patent law is *the* instrument of innovation policy.\"
        -   \"Intellectual Property is to the information society what
            the conventional property right was to the industrial
            society.\"
-   Reality
    -   -   Patent law is derailing (see
            [FTC](http://www.ffii.org.uk/ftc/ftc.html "wikilink") and
            [NAS](http://www4.nationalacademies.org/news.nsf/isbn/0309089107?OpenDocument "wikilink")
            studies in the US): it has become a stifling lawyers\'
            paradise.
        -   The patent-incrowd calls the shots (because of lack of
            opposition)
        -   The academic world has also been critical for a very long
            time in The Netherlands (Verkade, Spoor, Hugenholtz,
            Grosheide and other professors).
        -   Wrong incentives: patent granting is profitable for the
            granting organisation (government/EPO), which is unique
            among licensing bodies.

### Conclusion

-   Directive is tip of the iceberg.
-   Patent law is ripe for serious, systematic political attention.
-   It has everything to do with the \"knowledge economy\".
-   A chance for the Dutch Presidency?
