*3rd May 2005 \-- Christian Ude, mayor of Munich, criticises the
European Commission and the German government for their intransigence
regarding software patents.*

An article published by the Munich city administration cites Ude as
saying: \"The European Commission could have stepped onto the golden
bridge built by the European Parliament, but instead tries to affront
the Parliament and all critics.\"

The article goes on: \"Hence it is now to the EU Council of Ministers to
start a renewed discussion on the topic on a council level and to avoid
the clash of EU Commission and Parliament. At the end this is about
fruitful discussion and not about a power fight.\"

Ude is cited again: \"The best way out of this rare confrontation is for
the German government to ask for a reopening of negotiations in the
Council.\"
