*\*Brussels, 21 December 2004\** - A-items on the Tue 21 Dec afternoon
15:00 on the a-item list published 08:30, this is unusual
<http://kwiki.ffii.org/ConsAgenda041221En>

*\*Brussels, 20 December 2004\** - Appears as A-item on Tue 21 Dec
agenda, morning 10:15, in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council

*\*Brussels, 17 December 2004\** - The [agenda for the Environment
Council](http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/envir/83092.pdf "wikilink")
meeting of Monday is already up to its third revision at the time of
this writing. Earlier today, it mentioned that the software patents
directive would be handled at that meeting. In the afternoon, the
software patents directive was removed again from the schedule. The
Dutch government apparently didn\'t want to be accused of misinforming
its Parliament again.

Wednesday, Dutch State Secretary Van Gennip was questioned by the Dutch
parliamentary commission of economic affairs about the [preliminary
unilateral
statement](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st14/st14574-ad01co01.en04.pdf "wikilink")
of the Netherlands. At the end of the meeting, she conceded to have the
statement reviewed by the Parliament before it is officially presented
at the Council.

Yesterday, she sent a letter to the Parliament in which she noted the
directive would be treated on Tuesday 21 December. As such, the
Parliament would have time till Monday to decide about whether or not
stating that \"the rules on and the implementation practice of the
patentability for computer-implemented inventions are sufficiently
clear\" is compatible with [ its motion](NlMot040701En "wikilink") that
noted the Council text offers \"insufficient guarantees to prevent
excesses with regard to software patentability\".

Today\'s [ appearance](Cons041217En "wikilink") of the item on the
Environment Council\'s agenda from Monday raised a few eyebrows in the
Dutch Parliament, along with a hasty message from the Dutch government
stating that it was just a mistake (possibly another [ error in the word
processor](NlVote040701En "wikilink")). Now, the item has been removed
again from the Environment agenda.

It has not yet appeared on the [Agriculture and Fisheries
agenda](http://ue.eu.int/cms3_applications/Applications/newsRoom/loadbook.asp?BID=1000&LANG=2&cmsId=364 "wikilink")
of Tuesday either, however. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely the Dutch
Presidency will let its beleaguered directive text just slip away after
all the trouble it went through until now.

Jonas Maebe, board member of FFII, comments:

` "An artificial majority, an unsubstantial justification, motions`\
` which are ignored, agendas which are modified like there's no`\
` tomorrow... Maybe Brinkhorst miscalculated after all, in the sense`\
` that reopening the discussion in the Council would probably have`\
` made him look much more able than all this scheming to save a`\
` non-existent qualified majority. And we wouldn't be stuck with`\
` this text that nobody really likes."`
