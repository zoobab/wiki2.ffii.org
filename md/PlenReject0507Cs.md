Parliament has done a lot of work on the directive, and with the right
amendments passed, it *could* be amended to be not too bad. The decision
is therefore quite finely judged. However, on balance, FFII believes
that in the end a better legal text would be obtained by starting again
with a clean sheet of paper. It would also allow the time for more
comprehensive economic research into the implications, and keep all of
Europe\'s options open in the meantime. The decision is a narrow one,
but the need for a directive at this moment is not pressing. There is
therefore something to be said for taking time out to get it right.
