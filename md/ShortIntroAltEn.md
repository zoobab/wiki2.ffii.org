# Software Patents in Europe: A Short Overview {#software_patents_in_europe_a_short_overview}

A **patent** is a right to monopolize an invention.

A the applicant of a patent specifies a scope of activities from which
he wants to exclude others (the claims), and submits it to the Patent
Office (applying for a patent), which evaluates whether these claims
depict an *invention* within the sense of the law and whether the
invention is correctly disclosed and industrially applicable (formal
examination).

In addition, Patent offices have to examine whether the invention is new
and non-obvious (substantive examination). However the non-obviousness
standard is very low world-wide, in the EU like in the US.

If the application passes the examination, the Patent Office grants the
patent which means that the applicant gets the right to forbid others to
do what is destribed in the claims of the granted patent.

The common patent law in Europe is the [European Patent Convention (EPC)
from 1973](http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/ "wikilink").

In it\'s Article 52, it
[states](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/epc52/ "wikilink") states:

`(1) European patents shall be granted for any inventions which are susceptible`\
`    of industrial application, which are new and which involve an inventive step. `

`(2) The following in particular shall not be regarded as inventions`\
`    within the meaning of paragraph 1:`\
` (a) discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods;`\
` (b) aesthetic creations;`\
` (c) schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts,`\
`     playing games or doing business, and programs for computers;`\
` (d) presentations of information. `

So programs for computers are excluded from patentability, together with
many nother fields which where is makes sense to not have patents for.

In 1986, the European Patent Office (EPO) [started granting patents on
computer
programs](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/epo-t840208/index.en.html "wikilink")
nonetheless.

Today, the number of software patents granted by the EPO is [estimated
to be abouve than
30.000](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/stats/index.en.html "wikilink"),
and is increasing at a rate of 3,000 per year.

In 1997, the patent establishment surrounding the EPO began attempting
to rewrite the EPO to make their practice of granting patents on
software legal.

In August 2000, the European Patent Organisation, intergovernmental
organisation that runs the EPO, attempted to delete all the exclusion of
computer programs from the EPC, but failed due to public resistance.

In 2002, the European Commission submitted a [proposal
2002/0047](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/ "wikilink") for
a Directive \"on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.\"
The Directive was claimed to serve the purposes of harmonizing Member
State laws and clarifying some details in order to prevent excesses by
the EPO. However, a closer reading of the misleading phrasing and
terminology in the Directive reveals that the proposal would codify
unlimited patentability, as practiced by the EPO.

Representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and activists from
all across Europe, coordinated by the
[FFII](http://www.ffii.org/ "wikilink") undertook intensive lobbying.

In September 2003, the [European Parliament
voted](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/plen0924/index.en.html "wikilink")
incorporated [a set of amendments into the
Directive](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/index.en.html "wikilink")
clarified the non-patentability of programming and business logic.

Within the Council, the \"Working Party on Intellectual Property
(Patents)\" which consists of exactly the same members as the
Administrative Council of the EPO: patent office administrators from the
national governments. After a few months of secret negotiations, the
Working Party produced a [\"compromise
document\"](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/index.en.html "wikilink")
that eliminated all the Parliament\'s clarifying amendments, reinstated
the Commission\'s proposal which would make computer programs
patentable.

On May 18 2004, in a meeting of the Council a few cosmetic amendments
which do not change the text were added and the resulting text was
[adoped](http://kwiki.ffii.org/?Cons040518En "wikilink") by the Council.
It has been sent to European Parliament for 2nd reading.
