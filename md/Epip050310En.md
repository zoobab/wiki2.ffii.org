*10 March 2005 - The 5th EPIP conference, held in Copenhagen, included
several topics of interest to the people following the debate around the
European software patents directive. The FFII was also invited to
present its innovative Gauss patent database project.*

## About the conference {#about_the_conference}

The conference works on addressing the challenges of exclusion rights
(intellectual property) in the information age. Balancing the interests
in diffusion of knowledge with business requirements and desires is not
an easy task. Coupled with the fast-changing nature of the information
economy and the interdisciplinary requirements to assess all effects and
the effectiveness of proposed solutions, this provides for many
interesting presentations and discussions.

## FFII Contribution {#ffii_contribution}

This year, the FFII was invited to the conference as a keynote speaker.
Our contribution consisted of presenting the
[Gauss](http://gauss.ffii.org "wikilink") patent database project. The
two presentations were

-   [Gauss and EP political
    realities](http://www.ffii.se/erik/EPIP/img0.html "wikilink") by
    Erik Josefsson. This presentation demonstrates the usage of Gauss to
    compare the political claims of certain software patent proponents
    with their patent claims, and the discrepancies following from this
    confrontation.
-   [A searchable, commentable version of [CRM114](CRM114 "wikilink")
    applied to
    patents](http://gauss.ffii.org/roland/epip2005 "wikilink") by Roland
    Orre. This presentation focusses on the implementation of the Gauss
    database, how it works.

## Other interesting papers {#other_interesting_papers}

(in progress)

-   [Business Method Patents in Europe and their Strategic Use Â–
    Evidence from Franking Device
    Manufacturers](http://www.epip.ruc.dk/Papers/Wagner_Paper.pdf "wikilink")
    ([summary
    presentation](http://www.epip.ruc.dk/presentations/ses6nr3.pdf "wikilink"))
    by Stefan Wagner. The author has taken all US granted patents from
    their \"business methods\" class, and checked which ones had
    European equivalents. In March 2004, of the 8550 US business method
    patents, 1901 had European equivalent applications, of which 689 had
    already been granted. He concludes, among other things, that
    business methods are currently patentable at the EPO, and that
    business method patents have been used strategically in the industry
    for franking devices.

-   [ Software patents: a closer look at the European Commission\'s
    proposal](Rossi050310En "wikilink") by Maria Alessandra Rossi. A
    paper which analyses the original Commission proposal to the bare
    bones, along with an overview of the economical background. The link
    goes to an FFII summary of the paper (with a link to the full paper
    available, of course).
