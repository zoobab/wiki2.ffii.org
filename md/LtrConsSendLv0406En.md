An Urgent Appeal was sent to Latvian Prime minister Indulis Emsis by
Aigars Mahinovs (aigarius at laka.lv) from [Latvian Open Source
Association](http://www.laka.lv "wikilink") on the 1st of September
2004. The letter had also a 10 page Latvian explanation attached to it,
describing exact problems with the directive (arguments were taken from
FFII addendums to the appeal letter).

The announcement is also available at [LAKA home
page](http://www.laka.lv/tiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=25 "wikilink")
