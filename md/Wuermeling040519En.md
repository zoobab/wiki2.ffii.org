The shadow rapporteur of the European People\'s Party, Joachim
Wuermeling, issued a press release in which he praises the Council\'s
decision of 2004-05-18 as a \"strong signal for innovation in Europe\",
saying that they got it right, made ABS patentable while preventing a
drift toward patentability of business methods and programs as such, and
thereby protected particularly software developpers and !SMEs from
free-riding and idea-stealing. The European Parliament had been
misguided by an irrational campaign of panicmakers last september
according to Wuermeling.
