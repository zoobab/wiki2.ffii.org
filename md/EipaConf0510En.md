At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the
Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and
employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU
should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and
liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support the
knowledge society.

Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore
presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property
should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world,
particularly to stop internet piracy.

The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes
harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy,
of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to
the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.

EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its
innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries,
and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to
developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in
ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.

## Invitation

Luxembourg, 30 June 2005

Dear Sir/Madam,

On 6 and 7 October 2005, the Luxembourg Antenna of the European
Institute of Public Administration  the European Centre for Judges and
Lawyers  is organising a seminar on

Latest Developments in the Field of Intellectual Property

At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the
Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and
employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU
should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and
liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support the
knowledge society.

Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore
presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property
should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world,
particularly to stop internet piracy.

The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes
harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy,
of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to
the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.

EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its
innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries,
and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to
developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in
ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.

The seminar is aimed at lawyers, counsels in industrial property,
representatives of national industrial property institutes or agencies,
EU officials and national civil servants, professionals from the
industry and research sector, academics and other professionals
interested in intellectual property law.

EIPA would be honoured to count you among the participants. For
registrations received before the 9th of September, the registration fee
is  650 (including documentation, beverages, 2 lunches and a dinner).

interpretation between the two languages will be provided.

not hesitate to contact Mrs Juliette MOLLICONE-BOUSSUGE, Programme
Organiser, tel.: +352 426 230 304, fax: +352 426 237 eMail: Send We
