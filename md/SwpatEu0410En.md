# Software patents - state of the union {#software_patents___state_of_the_union}

Here is a short overview of the current situation.

## Legislative procedure {#legislative_procedure}

We are talking about a EU directive (that later is going to be
implemented into national law), that is to decide whether mathematical
and business methods implemented in computer programs should be
patentable.

-   In January 2002 the EU commission presented a proposal claiming to
    harmonise the situation in Europe. In reality, it cemented the
    enforceability of all granted software patents throughout the EU.
-   On 24 September 2003 the EU parliament changed this proposal, so
    that by clear exclusion clauses the enforcement of patents
    concerning pure software innovation is blocked.
-   On 18 May 2004 the EU council of ministers reached a preliminary
    political agreement over a new text. This text kept those exclusion
    clauses that can be easily circumvented. It would make 30,000
    already granted software patents (incl. business method patents)
    enforceable in the entire EU. At that time, Spain, Italy, Austria
    and Belgium did not support that position.
-   In Summer there was a Parliament decision in the Netherlands asking
    the minister to change his vote.
-   In July, the Dutch parliament passed a motion requesting the Dutch
    government to stop supporting the Council text.
-   In Germany, a motion by the liberals was discussed in the Bundestag
    on 21 October 2004. Other motions, by the conservatives and possibly
    also one by the Greens and Social Democrats are under way in
    Germany.
-   There is discussion in the Parliaments of several other countries as
    well
-   A possible date when the EU Council of Ministers could pass or
    (hopefully) revisit the preliminary political agreement, is 25/26
    November 2004. The representatives in the Council of Ministers
    typically come from the ministries of justice, economy or research,
    and are bound by the decisions of your government.

## FFII Position {#ffii_position}

FFII demands:

-   Legal certainty by clear exclusion clauses of the type \"X should
    not be patentable\" (emulating paragraph 52(2) EPC).
-   Freedom of publication: no patent violation by publishing or
    distributing software.
-   Guarantee that the usage of a computer in an office or networking
    environment can never lead to a patent infringement.
-   Clarification of the inclusion terms imposed by
    [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink"). Clear limitation of the term
    \"technology\". \"Technology\" never should refer to logic or
    algorithms.
-   Substantiation of Paragraph 30 [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") as
    interoperability privilege
