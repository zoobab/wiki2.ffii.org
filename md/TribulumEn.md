# Separate the wheat from the chaff {#separate_the_wheat_from_the_chaff}

(draft)

### Purpose

This article explains what directive is needed to seperate the wheat
from chaff. That is allow patenting of hardware patents and consumer
electronics and confirm the non-patentability of software \[1\]. It is
the the obligation of the law maker to clarify patent legislation and
maintain a plain level field for entreprenuers on the Single Market. The
current EPO practise that hampered competition has to be restrained.

### Remarks

\[1\] Often the destinction is made of non-patentability of software and
non-patentability of software \"as such\". However this phrase \"as
such\" is meaningless and derived from the wording of EPC 52(3) and thus
part of a misinterpretation of article 52. Therefore we will not make
the distinctions unless some institution defines the difference of
software \"as such\" and software.
