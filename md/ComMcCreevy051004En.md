*In reply to a question from a member of the European Parliament, the
Commissioner refused to help to solve the European software patent
problems created by the EPO. He mentioned that a regulatory act falling
in Community acquis could enable the Commission to act as it did before.
Here only \'technical\' problems were at stake. The Commissioner shows
unwillingness to solve the problems of European software development
creating by the EPO interpretation of the EPC and to act according to
the will expressed by the historical EU-Parliament decision.*

## The Question {#the_question}

-   [written question E-3015-05 by MEP Proinsias De Rossa
    (PSE)](http://tinyurl.com/c3ean "wikilink")

## E-3015/05EN Answer given by Mr [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink") on behalf of the Commission (4.10.2005) {#e_301505en_answer_given_by_mr_mccreevy_on_behalf_of_the_commission_4.10.2005}

The European Patent Convention (Article 52 EPC) **remains the applicable
legal framework in relation to computer programmes**. The European
Patent Office (EPO) applies and interprets this text when it grants the
patents.

The EPC provides several legal mechanisms which enable third parties to
monitor the procedure and allow decisions taken by the EPO to be
challenged. The EPC makes the following procedures available:

\- inspection by third parties of pending applications

\- observations by third parties on pending applications

\- opposition by third parties to granted patents

\- appeals by any party adversely affected by an EPO decision in grant
and opposition proceedings.

Furthermore, after these procedures have been exhausted actions for
revocation of European patents may be filed in national courts.

The EPO boards of appeal, who are completely independent in their
decision-making, have been assigned the duty of reviewing the decisions
of the EPO in grant and opposition proceedings, thereby interpreting the
EPC in cases where disputes arise. Neither the European Court of Justice
nor the Commission are competent to interpret the provisions of the EPC.
**The Commission, therefore, cannot judge whether the award of the
patents mentioned by the Honourable Member is compatible with Article 52
of the EPC**.

The Commission is entitled to oppose a decision of the EPO within the
statutory time limits. However, its competence is limited to matters
falling within the Community acquis. Therefore, **it is not able to act
where no such acquis exists**, e.g. in the area of computer-implemented
inventions where, following the rejection by Parliament of the
Commission\'s proposal for a Directive on Computer-Implemented
Inventions (vote of 6 July 2005), there are currently no specific
Community legal texts in force which are relevant to this issue. The
case of the computer implemented inventions is different from that of
the areas covered by the Directive 98/44/EC of the Parliament and of the
Council of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological
inventions\[1\], in which case the EPO has inserted the provisions of
the Directive into the Convention by way of an implementing regulation.

Parties to opposition proceedings at the EPO are not required to have
any economic or legal interest in the patent: any European citizen or
any entity with legal personality can file an opposition to a granted
patent.

The Commission **does not consider it necessary to contact the EPO with
regard to the patents that this body has granted**, to which the
Honourable Member refers. In the case of the EP0695351 patent
(biotechnology), moral and ethical issues were at stake. However, **in
the case of computer implemented inventions, the issues are purely
technical and the Commission does not therefore intend to intervene**.
The Commission has nevertheless forwarded to the EPO the concerns of the
Honourable Member regarding the patents in question.

In recent years, the Commission has not expressed concerns about any
other patents granted by the EPO.
