*On 31st March 2005 Czech Senate (the upper chamber of the Parliament of
the Czech Republic) on its plenary session voted for a recommendation
towards the government of the Czech Republic and Czech members of
European Parliament, asking them to regard the Council\'s agreement of
18th of May 2004 as illegitimate and to turn the fake limitations on
patentability, which are found in the Council\'s text, into real ones.*

## Resolution of Czech Senate (summarising translation) {#resolution_of_czech_senate_summarising_translation}

        programs as such can not be patented

    -   support efforts of EU member countries who have been opposing
        the Council\'s \"political agreement\" of 18th May 2005

## Quotes

Dan Ohnsorg of FFII.cz says:

Very few people in the Czech republic stand to benefit from software
patents. We don\'t even have a company like Siemens or Nokia with a big
software patent portfolio. The Czech share in the software patents
illegally granted by the European Patent Office is near zero percent.
Yet the ministry in charge has, under the influence of the patent office
and of diplomatic conformism, taken a hardline pro-patent position in
the EU Council, and it seemed that nobody in the Parliament cared what
they were doing. Now that has changed, but it remains to be seen whether
our Parliament can really exert any influence on those anonymous
diplomats and patent office administrators who legislate in our name in
the EU\'s supreme legislative body.
