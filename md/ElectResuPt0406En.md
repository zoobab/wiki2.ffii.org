# Analysis:

NOTE: good means a good vote (or intent of vote), bad means a bad vote
and unknown means position is not yet clear, regarding the September
24th, 2003 vote on Software Patents. There\'s no character evaluation
involved :)

**BE** has elected one (good) MEP: Miguel Portas. BE is as opposed to
software patents as CDU and PP.

**CDU (PCP+Greens)** has maintained the number of
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"), the same (both good) [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink")
continue: Ilda Figueiredo and Sergio Ribeiro

**PS** maintained number of [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"). Elected were:
António Costa (unknown), Ana Gomes (unknown), Francisco Assis (unknown),
Elisa Ferreira (unknown), Paulo Casaca (good), Sérgio Sousa Pinto (bad),
Fausto Correia (unknown), Edite Estrela (unknown), Capoulas Santos
(unknown), Jamila Madeira (unknown), Emanuel Jardim Fernandes (unknown)
and Manuel dos Santos (bad).

**PSD** lost two [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"). Elected were: João de Deus
Pinheiro (unknown), Vasco Graça Moura (good), Assunção Esteves
(unknown), José Silva Peneda (unknown), Sérgio Marques (unknown), Duarte
Freitas (unknown), Carlos Coelho (good).

**PP** (in coalition with PSD) maintained the (both good)
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") Luís Queiró and Ribeiro e Castro.

# OVERALL

PSD lost profoundly. With one less MEP over all and BE electing one MEP,
this means a bigger stroke than just loosing two
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"). Considering we lost one MEP in the reshuflle,
at first sight the software patent critical side may have been
reinforced, particularly if both PP [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") were
reelected.

Since PS lost Maria Carrilho and António Campos, there is lots of work
to do here, since PS voted quite badly on the software patents vote of
setember 24, 2003. **However, with the support from José Magalhães, PS
MP in national parliament, to the urgent appeal** for consillium vote
reversal, maybe the scenery will change positively.

BE didn\'t have any MEP before, but their position is clearly against
software patents.

# CONCLUSION

\|\| \|\| \*1999 good\* \|\| \*1999 bad\* \|\| \*1999 unknown\* \|\|
\*2004 good\* \|\| \*2004 bad\* \|\| \*2004 unknown\* \|\| \|\| \*BE\*
\|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\| 1 \|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\| \|\| \*CDU\* \|\| 2 \|\|
0 \|\| 0 \|\| 2 \|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\| \|\| \*PS\* \|\| 3 \|\| 8 \|\| 1 \|\|
1 \|\| 2 \|\| 9 \|\| \|\| \*PSD\* \|\| 5 \|\| 3 \|\| 1 \|\| 2 \|\| 0
\|\| 5 \|\| \|\| \*PP\* \|\| 2 \|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\| 2 \|\| 0 \|\| 0 \|\|
\|\| \*TOTAL\* \|\| \*12\* \|\| \*11\* \|\| \*2\* \|\| \*8\* \|\| \*2\*
\|\| \*14\* \|\|

Number of good [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") dropped by 4

Number of bad [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") dropped by 9

Number of unknown [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") increased by 12

To be sure, lots of those 14 unknown positions should be brought over to
our side. If we can do that, we can see our position reinforced. Loosing
a few [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") but incresing largely the number of
unknown positions means there\'s a lot of work ahead of us.
