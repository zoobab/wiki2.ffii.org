# FFII Media Work: Empowering the Media to write about Software Patents {#ffii_media_work_empowering_the_media_to_write_about_software_patents}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*News organs often lack the competence and confidence to write about
software patents and other subjects of interest to the FFII. We need to
be ready to explain things and to provide usable pieces of text and
graphics. Inquiries from media and potential volunteers are answered by
the media helpdesk media-help at ffii org.*

## Objectives

-   watch the media:
    -   -   subscribe to
            [UrlWatch](http://www.ffii.org/assoc/knecht/watch/ "wikilink")
        -   <http://news.google.com>, search for keywords such as
            \"software, patents\"
-   encourage the media to take up information infrastructure themes
    more regularly (the main reason that such themes are not in the
    media is a shortage of educated journalists, not disinterest of the
    readers)
-   find out and document who the interested journalists are, what they
    need from us
-   investigate into misinformation campaigns of the Commission et al
    (e.g. regular false claims about contents of their proposals and
    through which channels they are propagated into the media)
    -   -   complain to [ EU Ombudsman](EuroOmbudsmanEn "wikilink") and
            organisations for journalistic ethics as well as watchdogs
            that look at media abuse by administrations
-   help our helpers to talk to the media
    -   -   make sure the core data are in our repr database and
            accessible to the <http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en> system, so
            that supporters can more easily participate in the work
-   make sure the interested journalists are on our [news mailing
    list](http://lists.ffii.org/listinfo/news/ "wikilink") and on more
    specific news lists where applicable
-   push current !PRs to the media
-   directly communicate with some journalists regularly
    -   -   write short mails that point to whatever info FFII can
            offer, publish these as letter templates here
-   write articles or text modules that journalists or editors can
    directly use
-   make sure we can make best use of media channels
    -   -   find out prices and conditions for pushing !PRs to media
            (e.g. OTS)
        -   find out prices and conditions for advertising in media

`    * `[`Parliament`` ``Magazine`](http://www.ffii.org/proj/media/parlmag/ "wikilink")

-   write documents (!FAQs) that answer questions of journalists and of
    people willing to help
