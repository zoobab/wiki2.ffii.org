# Invitation:

Dear Intellectual Property Professional:

The Intellectual Property Society (\"IP Society\") produces events and
forums that address the interests and concerns of investors,
entrepreneurs, technologists, artists, writers, and other professional
and creative workers. Our special mission is to provide an outreach from
the intellectual property professions to business, technology and
creative communities, as well as the general public. We aim to enrich
the public dialog concerning the role of intellectual property and the
common welfare.

Please visit our website as <http://ipsociety.net> to learn more about
our mission and activities. The readings section (located at

informayion of special interest to many of you.

In particular, if you or your clients are involved in the wireless or
