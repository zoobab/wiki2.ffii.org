*Note: the German translation of the original letter which was on this
page can still be found* [ here](OpenLtrOrg050307De "wikilink").
*Although I do not think that anything I wrote there was fundamentally
wrong, the criticism on the proposed European Constitution had in fact
little to do with what happened in the Council session of 7 March 2005.
Although the Constitution does not address the problems which arose
there, it would not have made things worse either. Additionally,
although it was clear* [ we had the rules on our
side](LtrFfiiCons050308En "wikilink"), *they found ways around them
anyway. Our primary need is a change of attitude at the Council, and
that\'s completely independent from any treaty or Constitution.*
