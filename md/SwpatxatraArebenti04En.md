Direct your message to your local !MPs and let them forward it to the
appropriate party representatives and to the ministers in charge of the
subject. Usually, this is the ministry of trade or the ministry of
justice.

Tell them your own experience and draw the conclusions, mentioning for
example:

-   Programmers shall not be deprived of their work. When a programmer
    has made a program, he has the copyright on it, and no one else
    shall be able to restrict his right to publish or sell it or lay
    down the conditions of use without the programmer\'s consent. This
    is the very foundation of any working business model in the software
    market, and software patents undermine it.
-   Software patents promote only one business model: Impose a private
    tax on market players, divert resources into patent filings and
    lawsuits instead of R&D, perform litigation instead of innovation.
    This climate only supports megacorporations and oligopolists, it
    raises prices, slows down innovation, hinders competition, decreases
    variety and quality.
-   It is easy to describe an algorithm as a computer-implementable
    method, the actual work is in doing the implementation. That\'s what
    programmers do. Therefore, the incentive must be for the programmer,
    in the form of copyright, without any legal uncertainty or risk of
    stepping onto patent mines.
-   Software patents have not encouraged innovation, but have stifled
    it. Broadly known examples are data formats and communication
    protocols using compression methods: Stac (ISDN), LZW (GIF), RLE
    (JPEG), MP3 where patents severely affect interoperability. (See
    <http://swpat.ffii.org/patente/wirkungen/>.)
-   Algorithms are useless until implemented. Patenting algorithms means
    hindering others from making them useful. This directly hinders
    innovation.
-   It\'s like patenting truths to hinder others from making any use
    thereof. Logic is a system, and making one part unavailable
    demolishes the system.
-   The hope for a genius rewarded by a software patent has no support
    from real business. Actually, software patents are spread out like
    traps for others to step into by accident.
-   The key to distinguish unpatentable logic from patentable subject
    matter is a strict definition of technical contribution, requiring
    the use of controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable
    results. The european parliament has provided such a definition, and
    it shall not get weakened.
-   Without requirement of a use of controllable forces of nature,
    claims become so abstract that they cover *any* implementation, not
    just a specific one. This is what makes software patents so harmful
    und unjust.
-   The task is about reverting EPO grant policy back to a lawful
    doctrine. It is \_\_not\_\_ about legalizing illegal patents in the
    name of harmonization.
-   It is not up to us to switch to doing patent business when we
    already know that it\'s bad. It is up to politics to save us from
    getting robbed by software patents.
-   Explain that the US patent laws, the EPO is adopting, are designed
    to protect slave labor and not Intellectual Property. In order for
    US corporations to move production around between countries with
    cheap labor, they have to prevent their products from being copied
    by manufacturers in those countries and be sold into the markets.
    The US is putting pressure on countries to have the same patent
    laws. The US patent laws create market monopolies necessary to
    facilitate this use of slave labor, even for products that
    technically are not new inventions, but just variations over old
    themes. This is an attack on the work forces of countries that
    provide the bare necessities of a modern democratic society with a
    higher cost of living.
-   The US patent laws the EPO is adopting, is protecting market
    monopolies by big corporations, which forces smart people to work
    for them instead of starting their own businesses.
-   A good environment for starting up software development in Europe
    will encourage smart people in the US and around the world to come
    to Europe to build their futures there.
