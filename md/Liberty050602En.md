*2005-06-02: A huge Statue of Liberty was erected at Place du
Luxembourg/Brussels.*

A Statue at Place du Luxembourg signalled the protest against software
patenting. Unfortunately the demonstration could not pass Place du
Luxembourg, but soon after the demonstration many participants took part
in a free software dinner organised by FSF Europe in a Caf√© at Place du
Luxembourg. The Statue demonstrated bypassers the rejection of the
Uncommon Council Position unter surveillance of organiser Benjamin
Henrion (Association Electronic Libre. The statue of liberty uses the
symbolic statue known from the Eurolinux-Petition Logo. Therefore the
Statue wears the logo banner of the petition of 400 000 Europeans: \"No
ePatents!\"
