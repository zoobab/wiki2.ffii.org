*18 April 2005 \-- Erik Josefsson, FFII\'s Brussels representative,
today spoke at the \"Digital Ecosystems: Re-tuning the user requirements
after 3 years\" workshop. Confronting copyright ecosystems with patent
monocultures, Mr. Josefsson explained the importance of \"fast, cheap,
narrow and safe\" exclusion right systems for* !SMEs.

## Report

The [Digital Ecosystem](http://www.digital-ecosystems.org/ "wikilink")
initiative by the Directorate General for Information Society of the
European Commission is a project to encourage ICT adoption by
businesses, in particular !SMEs. It\'s goal is to enhance ICT usage by
businesses in Europe, especially by SME\'s, and finding out which future
ICT development are required in order to enhance their business
processes.

At today\'s
[workshop](http://www.digital-ecosystems.org/events/2005.04/workshop_3ya1.html "wikilink"),
FFII replaced CEA-PME to speak in the SME panel. In [his
presentation](http://www.ffii.se/erik/DBE/DBE20050418.html "wikilink")
titled \"!SMEs and Software Patents\", Mr. Josefsson stressed that it is
important for !SMEs to know that they own what they produce themselves.

One important fact the presentation demonstrated, was that applying
software patents to the envisioned Digital Business Ecosystem results in
potentially encumbering one third of the infrastructure.

Most of the attendants were very supportive of FFII\'s views, and one of
the presenters even included the !NoSoftwarePatents.com logo in his
presentation, saying \"We have to redesign the whole DBE-platform if the
software patents come to Europe\".
