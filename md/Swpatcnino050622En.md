This month\'s [Game Developer
Magazine](http://www.gdmag.com/homepage.htm "wikilink") spots an article
by [Mr. S. Gregory
Boyd](http://www.kenyon.com/attorneys/bio.aspx?attid=321231705 "wikilink")
on software patents and their conseguences titled \"Why Prior Art
Matters\". The author is involved in several patent litigations and had
previously spoken at this year Game Developer Conference on [IP
protection through
copyright](http://www.cmpevents.com/GD05/a.asp?option=G&V=3&id=269633 "wikilink").

The article itself is centered on prior art and its value against
patents. Provided the accused infringer can stand up the costs of
finding the prior art, a patent can be declared invalid. Actually,
finding prior art is especially difficult, costly, and time consuming,
often calling for industry experts and such rising up the costs of a
already expensive process. This search is also prone to fail because of
the lack of organization in this field of human knowledge, which has
often choosen trade secrets or copyrights as its IP protection
mechanism.

It is interesting to see an industry expert from what it is considered
to be the leading country in software production and patenting standing
this position against patentability. There\'s obvious evidence even the
US software producers greatly suffers from this kind of protection and
it\'s acting to dismantle it by the aforementioned organization of prior
art.

Mr. Boyd personally takes a very clear position on the topic: \"/Patents
are offensive instruments. Contrary to the popular belief, a patent does
not give a company the right to sell an invention; instead, a patent
prevents others from selling any product or system that falls within the
claims of the patented invention. Patent holders often use litigation or
the threat of litigation to force competitors to stop selling or, more
commonly, to pay for a license fee/\".

It is remarkable the given elements perfecly meet what many
organizations already said against software patenting. The fact it\'s on
paper press is evidence of a large audience and thus that many
enterprises are being hampered by this largely abused kind of IP
protection.

1.  1.  PS: maybe the issue will be avaiable online at
        <http://www.gdmag.com/archive/jun05.htm>.
    2.  While it\'s unlikely the article will be mass-diffused, maybe
        providing the link will be
    3.  useful.
    4.  I understand using wiki referring to commercial initiatives is
        not a good thing however,
    5.  i did so to make people weight this more. If you think it\'s
        bad, feel free to remove the
    6.  references (please keep me informed so I won\'t do this mistake
        twice).
    7.  UPDATE 1.1: I forgot to mention the title of the original
        article. Added.
