## Outline

An insurance venture called \"Open Source Risk Managment\" (OSRM)
estimates that Linux-based systems fall afoul of 283 not-yet-litigated
patents, among them 27 from Microsoft, and offer an insurance for
covering the litigation risk.

[ Dan Ravicher](DanRavicherEn "wikilink") claims to have conducted the
investigation but does not disclose the patents and how they are
infringed because by doing so he would expose people to a heightened
risk of knowing and wilful infringment.

Apart from the confidentiality, there are however some more reasons to
doubt about the figures:

-   it seems impossible for 1 person or a small group to investigate the
    mass of relevant patents and relevant software code and single out
    any precise number of patents.
-   the campaign seems to serve a clear PR purpose, e.g. that of telling
    people that
    -   -   there is a big risk
        -   the risk is managable, we can handle it
        -   the risk is due to patents which can be challenged in court
            with prior art, corroborated patents are not infringed
            (lawyer\'s dream: litigation services are the key to solving
            all problems)
-   As the [Forbes
    article](http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2004/08/02/cz_dl_0802linux.html "wikilink")
    points out, Ravicher has made some questionable public statements
    before.

Yet there is some reason to believe that the OSRM people are seriously
committed to building a systematic defense strategy for the free
software community in the US.

Perhaps the figure of 283 is simply a conservative estimate of the
number of patents of which an ordinary GNU/Linux system (and also an MS
Windows system) probably falls afoul.

In a recent [ rough report for the Munich Municipal
administration](Limux040730En "wikilink"), FFII came up with a figure of
50 probably infringed patents granted by the EPO, but this figure was
based on very insufficient browsing of both the patents and the
concerned software. Especially in kernel-related fields such as memory
managment the situation looks completely unoverseeable and we would
especially like to hear how OSRM arrives at their estimate that the
Linux kernel is not falling afoul of any one of hundreds or thousands of
patents in this field or that all these patents problems can be solved
by an insurance.

An insurance will not cover operational losses or the losses associated
with not being able to use a patented technique. There is also a risk
that an initiative such as OSRM, just like the meanwhile defunct
priorart.org initiative which was associated with some of the same
\"community leaders\", will just enlist volunteer labor from the free
software community in order to help the patent office clean up its mess
of poorly examined patents and thereby strengthen the credibility of the
more dangerous ones.

See our [criticism of
priorart.org](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/shield/ "wikilink").
