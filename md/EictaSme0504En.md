*EICTA is sending 50 \"hightech SME//s\" to visit the European
Parliament and complain about loss of patent protections. Most of these
SME//s are losers of the software patent game. As far as they own any
patents at all, these are either business method patents, which their
own \"Manifesto\" says shouldn\'t be grantable, or patents on solutions
involving forces of nature, which are grantable under the Parliament\'s
position of 2003 anyway. At least two of of the SME bosses are
high-ranking Microsoft managers. Others are business partners of
companies like IBM. Yet EICTA\'s \"SME\" lobbying efforts appear to have
swayed several formerly critical JURI MEP//s into publicly stating that
\"the industry\", regardless of company size, wants software patents.*
