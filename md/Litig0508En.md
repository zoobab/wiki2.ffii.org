*FFII is being attacked by people who are trying to consume our
ressources with legal costs. We need to find ways to reduce these
costs.*

-   nutzwerk: warn all parties who could receive lawyer threat letters,
    establish channels for emergency cases
-   nutzwerk (phm & lawyers): deal with
    [Nutzwerk](http://nutzwerk.ffii.org "wikilink"): documents needed to
    make IT-unsavvy courts understand what is wrong with Nutzwerk. Will
    be made accessible at <http://nutzwerk.ffii.org/ffii/>
