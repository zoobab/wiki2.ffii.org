Q: Note to webmaster: Broken Link, in the Further Reading block at the
bottom of your Horror Gallery page, I received an Alert box in my
Netscape 7.02 browser, bearing text saying, \"www.bountyquest.com could
not be found. Please check the name and try again.\" And it has repeated
six 6 times, now, at 1625 to 1637 GMT 2003/11/30.

A: Indeed Bountyquest seems to have closed down. In fact many
initiatives aimed at fighting \"bad software patents\" with prior art
seem to have been unsuccessful, including

\- [Software Patents Institute](http://www.spi.org/ "wikilink") (accused
by [ Greg Aharonian](SwpataharonianEn "wikilink") of having been a
\"fraudulent\" enterprise from the start)

\- [Priorart.org](http://www.priorart.org "wikilink")
