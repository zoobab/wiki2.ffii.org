-   it should become clearer more quickly what exactly the sender wants
    the recipient to do. Asking questions is one way of prompting
    action. Anything that isn\'t designed to prompt an action could be
    left out to shorten the letter. General remarks that are not
    specific to the relation between sender and recipient are better
    transferred into external documents or replaced by references to
    such documents.

## Dear Mr. Erkki Liikanen, {#dear_mr._erkki_liikanen}

I am founder and owner of !OpenSceneGraph Professional Services, a
software company based in Scotland. My company specialises in the
development of real-time graphics software, with a user base which
include large corporation/organisations such as Boeing, NASA, ESA, Sony,
!BAe, Indra, Halliburton, Dera, US Army/Navy right down to small
business and university researchers. My company develops both open
source and closed source software.

I write out of concern over the Irish Presidency\'s proposal for the
directive on patentability of \"computer-implemented inventions\".
Perhaps I should rephrase my concern: like may others in software
industry I am simply **appalled** by the new proposal, as its has very
serious consequences to the viability of my own business, and on the
user base that depends upon my software.

The new proposal scraps all the key ammendments brought in by the EP in
September 2003, and introduces introduces program claims\[1\], thereby
making the text even more pro-patent than the Commission\'s proposal of
February 2002. This brings the text in line with the recent practises of
the European Patent Office (EPO), which has been systematically granting
broad and trivial patents on pure software in anticipation of a planned
change of law since 1986 and especially since 1998. Since DG Infosoc
appear not to have objected to these very serious departures from the EP
text of 2003 and from the Commission text of 2002 (in which the absence
of program claims is widely believed to have been an achievement of DG
Infosoc), should it be assumed that DG Infosoc now supports
patentability of \"computer-implemented\" algorithms, business methods
and of program texts, as practised by the EPO?

If DG Infosoc does now support unlimited patentability of software could
you please provide details of any independent economic studies that show
such unlimited patentability of software is good for European business
and society in general?

With 76% of software patents granted by the EPO being from outside the
EU \[2\], it would at least seem at a first glance to suggest that the
bulk of revenue from licensing of software patents would leave the EU.
Do DG Infosoc have an analysis of the value of the licensing of software
patents and its effect on the trade deficit?

At a smaller scale, what this deficit actually means to the average EU
software business is that they will incur greater costs than they
receive in revenues from software patents, and therefore will be less
competitive, less profitable, and have less freedom to develop features
that customers require, not to mention the greater risks due to
offensive patent litigation. Clearly software patents are not
universally good for the industry. What types of business does the DG
Infosoc expect to gain which types would loose from unlimited software
patentability?

Legal analysis \[3\] of international treaties (Berne, Trips etc)
clearly shows that computer programs should be treated as works of
literature, and therefore are covered by copyright, futhermore works of
literature cannot be treated as inventions, and therefore cannot be
covered by patents as doing so would contradict the rights governing
literature. The Presidency draft treats software as patentable therefore
is in contravention of these treaties. Does DG Infosec believe that
computer programs are works of literature or invention?

I do not envy DG Infosec position, no doubt under pressure from the
patent community, and well funded lobbying from multi-nationals which
are pushing for unlimited patability of software, and on the other side
pressure from [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") (which form economic majority in
the IT sector\[4\]) and the EU community at large pushing for the
continuation of copyright as being appropriate protection for software.
It might be worth noting how much opposition software patents have in
Europe - over 320,000 people have signed the Petition for a Software
Patent Free Europe \[5\], this is 1/3rd the size of population of
Brussels. That\'d be quite a welcoming party if all the signatories
turned up on your doorstep at once.

Of course whether they\'d be welcoming or hostile depends very much on
DG Infosoc\'s actions over the coming weeks. I would encourage the DG
Infosoc to consider very careful what is best for Europe, and if it has
any doubts about what is the best way forward then it should do
everything in its power to defer the Council decision on the Presidency
proposal, due on the 17th/18th May meeting of Ministers, and refer it
back for further discussion and refinement.
