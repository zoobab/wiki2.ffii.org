## Quotes

The list the jury has drawn up covers inventions from all the **fields
of technology** in which the EPO granted European patents between 1991
and 2000. It granted over 380 000 patents in that period, so in making
their choice the jurors drew on the technical expertise of the Office\'s
3 500 patent examiners. Prizes are to be awarded in six categories, and
three candidates have been nominated for each of them.

As President Pompidou puts it: \"The panel\'s selection is clear
evidence that major R&D achievements, especially in marketable high-tech
fields, are nowadays primarily the result of teamwork and coâ€‘operation.
Obtaining patent protection for this research is a key to successful
product marketing.\"

Lifetime achievement nominations:

Karlheinz Brandenburg (Ilmenau, Germany) revolutionised the music world
by inventing the MP3 **format**, now the standard for music storage.
There are 200 million people with MP3 **software** on their computers,
and 50 million MP3 players were sold last year alone.
