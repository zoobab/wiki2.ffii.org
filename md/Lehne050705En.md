*Lehne first praises Kauppi for adopting the party line which he forced
on her, then procedes to claiming that this directive is not about
software and the Council\'s position is to prevent patents on pure
software, and that small and medium companies in the software field are
happy with the Council\'s position.*

Thank you president, ladies and gentlemen.

Ofcourse we give thanks to rapporteur and shadow raporteur, but here in
partucular I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur for our group,
Piia-Noora Kaupii who has done a great job here, and found some
excellent compromises to come up with the right solutions and shown
tremendous know-how here. I have as much admiration as is possible for
the job that she has done on this.

One thing I want to make perfectly clear, and it was clear in the legal
affairs commmitee there too. Nobody, no political group, no individual,
wants software patents , well - some individuals might, but that\'s not
really what this is all about.

The point behind the directive was to prevent the development that has
taken place in the US and is taking place in Europe too. That is the
goal. And the common position meets that goal as well. We have heard the
chamber of commerce and industry in Munich and Upper Bayern and they
said to us that (that is btw, the part of Germany where they have the
biggest concentration of small business developing software), and they
feel that too, that the common position will solve their problems and
meet their requirements, but they can be improved none the less, and in
the legel affairs commitee we came up with a whole series of decisive
improvements in the form of 39 amendments, clarifications , new options
being created, interoperabitily, technical definitions and so on. Those
are examples. It\'s a moderate report which is a good attempt to solving
the problems we have.

The Rocard amendments and those from other groups however have gone way
beyond this goal. They even refer to the Lisbon process. There is
nothing in the Lisbon process about the knowledge based economy in
Europe. All our knowledge depends on the skill of our people. So what is
going to happen if we have all these extreme amendments that go far too
far, if we go along with those, future generation in this continent will
loose the chance of livelyhood, and I think that is why the vast
majority of our group do not agree with those amendments.

The next important point is the refusal amendments, the refusal
amendments so called, to refuse the common position and send it back to
commission. There are two reasons to take this into consideration. First
of all, we are going to have to go through a long conservation process
on the basis on amendments in the legal affairs commitee and then we
could loose out at the end of the third reading by a simple majority.
Secondly we don\'t want to cause harm to Europe in general and the
Lisbon process in particular by means of these amendments. That is the
decision we have to make today.
