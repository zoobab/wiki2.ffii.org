*28th February 2005 \-- On Februari 11, Carl B. Hamilton, member of the
Swedish Parliament for the Liberal Party of Sweden, asked the Swedish
government to handle the software patent directive seriously and with
great great care. It would be reasonable to raise the issue as a B-item
at the Competitiveness Council, said Hamilton speaking for the Liberal
group in the Swedish Parliament.*

In the answer published on Friday, Swedish minister for justice Tomas
Bodström declined a clear answer.

Bodström has been one of the most vocal promoters of the hardline
pro-patent course of the Council that culminated in the agreement of May
2004, which since then was not adopted due to the lack of a qualified
majority in the Council. His unclear answer suggests that he would like
to see the Council\'s current draft adopted as an uncontroversial item
(A-item) at one of the upcoming Council meetings.
