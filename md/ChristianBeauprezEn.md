Christian Beauprez is a programmer who has studied law. Christian runs
the website codeliberty.org, where he has, beside some humorous pieces
and database search systems, studied the position of patents and
copyright in the system of !TRIPs, Berne Convention and European Patent
Convention, arriving at the conclusion that \"programmers have rights\"
and that these rights are under threat from a lobby of patent lawyers
acting in bad faith.
