*The European Union is a quasi-state where legislative power is wielded
by anonymised rounds of bureaucrats, without effective parliamentary
control. The software patent directive is a point in case. The proposed
constitution threatens to further strengthen the Council\'s and
Commission\'s autocracy.*

*\"If the EU were to apply for membership in the EU, we would have to
reject the application due to lack of democracy.\"* (apocryphal quote by
enlargement commissioner Guenter Verheugen)

Todays EU has several serious democratic deficiences. This has become
apparent, for example, in the software patent directive (2002/0047 COM,
\"on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\"). Here a
small group of patent bureaucrats is able to largely ignore the European
Parliament and national parliaments. Due to the relatively great public
interest in the case (many Members of the European Parliament say
popular concern over this directive was greater than over any other
piece of legislation which they have handled) and the tradition of
oligarchy in patent legislation, the problems have perhaps become more
apparent in this case than in most others.

However the EU\'s lack of democracy has been well known and identified
in the European Convention, which also recommended possible solutions.
However, these solutions were incorporated into the Draft Constitutional
Treaty only partly.

## Criteria

-   Should be: Legislative powers in the hand of an elected body.
    Codecision by indirect elected body. Balance of Powers.
-   Today: Hostile takeover from the executive branch (Commission,
    member states administration), Elected bodies Eu-Parliament and
    national Parliaments may issue \"statements.\" EU-Parliament is
    voted with regard of National policy. In the Council process
    National Parliament has very little influence. Commission has
    legislative initiative right only and drafts a lot of different
    legislative acts with its large staff, for which EU-Parliament lacks
    capacity to care about them all. Additionally Brussels is
    overcrowded with Business lobbyists, while [NGOs](NGOs "wikilink")
    and citizens\' are underrepresented. Meps often take ordinary
    citizen not serious as long as they do not represent a larger group.
-   Souvereignity: The EU is granted its rights by member states, not by
    the people.
-   Lack of interest from unprofessional observers. Criticism of EU
    policy is often bound to the EU at large. E.g. being against the
    current EU-Constitution draft does not mean beeing anti-European.
-   Frame regulation under the mantra of harmonisation which decreases
    flexibility: FCN - Test: Cheap, Fast, Narrow.
-   one Commissioner for each memberstate leads to unsystematic Profiles
    of Commissioners: Industry, Internal Market, Information Society,
    \... with a lot of overlap.
-   Programmatic rather than liberal policy.
-   Constitution draft commits European parties to a certain core
    policy, this could be rendered meaningless but is expression of
    abusive pratice.

## Convention works {#convention_works}

*Introduction*

The process of discussing and reaching agreement on Treaty change is
known as an Intergovernmental Conference (or IGC). On 4 October 2003, at
a meeting of Heads of State or Government, an IGC was convened by the
President of the Council of the EU (Council), on the recommendation of
the Council and following consultation of the European Parliament and
the Commission, and was conducted by Heads of State or Government,
assisted by Ministers for Foreign Affairs. This IGC was different from
others, since it has been preceded by a Convention which was set up in
order to come forward with recommendations on the key issues arising for
the Union\'s future development. The Convention met between March 2002
and June 2003, and was built by Representatives of

-   the Heads of State or Government of the Member States
-   the National Parliaments
-   the European Parliament
-   the European Commission
-   the Governments of the accession candidate countries
-   the National Parliaments of the accession candidate countries
-   Observers

The European Convention submitted its recommendations in the form of a
new draft Constitutional Treaty on 19 June 2003.

### EU reform: Questions relating to the European Commission\'s sole right of initiative {#eu_reform_questions_relating_to_the_european_commissions_sole_right_of_initiative}

*Note: The following are not quotes but only excerpts roughly translated
from a german original !*

-   There was a discussion in the plenary 02-09-12/13 about the
    commissions monopol of legislative initiative: Only the commision
    can start a legislative process, including requests for changes in
    the EU law itself, which was considered to be a serious democratic
    weakness.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Parliament and Council can request starting a lex procedure,
    however, this is not legally binding for the Commission. It can
    decide to meet such requests freely. (There are a few exceptions for
    Council in some special areas). Example: EP decided to support the
    EU border regions with ¤ 100,000,000 and requested to create a new
    legal basis for such purpose. Commission, however, simply refused to
    do so and intends to direct the money into another (already
    existing) programme.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The commission refuses even strong political will to propose law
    corrections. Example: Commission didn\'t follow the clear request by
    member states to postpone the duty-free abolishment.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Also, the commission can withdraw a proposal (eg in the case of
    unwanted amendements) at any stage of the procedure. This can be
    used to pressure EP to abstain from specific amendements, as for
    example with the directive on \'alien take-over\'.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   As a consequence, reasons and desire for corrections of laws
    increases over years, and once a directive get voted in EP, many
    amendments on a broad scope are done at once, which is rather
    strenuous for politicians, and not very efficient in terms of
    dynamic flexibility.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Especially critical is the fact that Commission regulates itself.
    For example, if it simply doesn\'t propose to hand over
    responsibilities itself, the will never happen.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The initiative monopol descends from the EC foundation which was
    built by 6 member states only and had a very limited scope. It
    doesn\'t fit into todays democratic EU of 25 member states with a
    wide range of responsibilities and much more power.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   For real democracy, there\'s no way but Parliament and Council must
    also have the right to propose laws, where Commission should be
    focused on executive tasks.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Accordingly Council should hand over executive tasks to Commission.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   As first step, Council and Parliament could get the right to porpose
    law modifications at least in the area of legislative and codecision
    itself. Commission would participate in this process with limited
    power of influence only: In Council, the fall-back on unanimity
    voting in case Commission disagrees should be abandonded, and
    Commission wouldn\'t have the right to withdraw proposals which
    origin from Council or EP.

Brussels, 18 September 2002 CONV 276/02 CONTRIB 95

### True Subsidiarity Contribution to the Convention on Subsidiarity {#true_subsidiarity_contribution_to_the_convention_on_subsidiarity}

The 3 principles in art. 5 of the treaty now has to be taken seriously.
The principle of legality means that the EU can only take a decision if
there is a proper legal base for the decision in the treaty. The
principle of subsidiarity means that decisions shall be taken as close
to the people as possible. The principle of proportionality means that
no EU decision can be defended if it is possible to fulfil the purpose
with a less restrictive measure. It means that directives shall be
preferred for regulations. Recommendations should be preferred before
directives. Deliberate and voluntary standards shall be preferred before
harmonisation. That minimum-harmonisation shall be preferred before
total harmonisation.

*\_The scope of the problems\_*

The existing acquis shall be tested towards the 3 strong principles. The
European Commission shall be asked to deliver a report. Every GD shall
be asked to define what part of their acquis they would prefer to get
rid of if they should reduce their part of the acquis to the half. The
Regional committee should have the same parallel task. The working group
of subsidiarity could then put forward a proposal for slimming the
existing acquis. This exercise is paramount if we want to be in dialogue
with the citizens. The majority of citizens in all European countries
except Luxembourg and Ireland would ignore or even be happy if the EU
was dissolved. Rightly or wrong, Peoples across Europe feels that the EU
decides too much. Referendums can have No-majorities in any country in
Europe unless all EU institutions adapt to the 3 fundamental limitations
in art. 5. The former Commission president Jacques Santer was aware of
the fundamental problem of lack of popular support when he proposed that
the EU should work \"Less and better\" in order to apply to the
principle of subsidarity. For a lot of reasons he could not deliver less
and better. President Prodi has suggested the same cure, and even former
president Jacques Delors has criticised too much centralisation in
Brussels. Since we now have an EU, with a degree of centralisation that
no one wanted, we have to adopt new procedures to avoid unwanted
centralisation in the future.

*\_We are all Sinners\_*

All Members of the European Parliament are sinners to the principles of
legality, subsidiarity and proportionality. The distribution of
competencies invites to sin. When a Member of Parliament has a good idea
or is asked to help for a good cause, they automatically try to do it
through the EU system, instead of considering whether it should really
be an EU affair or a national task. The European Parliament has no
responsibility for taxing the citizens but a wide range of possibilities
for inventing new expenditures leading to future taxation where the
electorates do not hold them responsible. They can decide expenditure
but has no responsibility for where the money comes from. The budget
procedure is used in creative and even illegal manners to insert new
expenditures for new purposes. Many projects start as pilot projects
without proper legal base from a decision in the Council. The Commission
is forced to use the non-obligatory money as decided by the Parliament.
If the Commission refuses they can be punished through the decharge
procedure.

-   The European Parliament shall no longer have a right to insert new
    expenditures before there is a proper legal base decided by
    legislative authority.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The European Commission shall have no right to finance any activity
    without a proper legal base.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Any citizen and institution shall have the right to question the
    lack of legal base before the Court. The right to initiate new
    legislation and activities is a monopoly of an institution in
    Brussels who would gain influence and power by using this monopoly
    to centralise activities. You cannot expect the Commission to act
    against their own narrow interest. We need a system of checks and
    balances where the monopoly of proposing legislation is modified by
    a body composed of others interests.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The national parliaments and regional parliaments with a legislative
    function shall control the Commission initiative right. Shall it be
    in a new institution as proposed by Joschka Fischer and Tony Blair?
    Can we establish a second chamber of elected national MPs to control
    subsidiarity? If we establish a new institution based in Brussels it
    will soon start thinking and working as the other centralising
    institutions in Brussels. A vast majority of speakers in the
    Convention clearly rejected the idea of a second chamber.

*\_Recipe for how National Parliaments to control Subsidiarity\_*

We should avoid setting up a new institution and instead give the
framing of the initiative right to the national parliaments.

-   The national parliaments shall adopt the legal base for any piece of
    community legislation and activity. It can be unanimously or by
    qualified majority, but the decision on the legal base shall be
    moved from Brussels to the capitals of our parliamentary
    democracies. The national parliaments should have the final say when
    decided on whether the Community can make binding regulations or
    recommendations according to the legal base are taken. The decision
    on the legal base can be included in the annual legislative
    programme. The procedure could start with meetings between the
    specific committees of the Member States parliaments who could form
    specific Cosac-structures for the transport committees,
    environmental committee\'s etc. They could discuss where they are
    not able to make efficient legislation in their own countries. They
    could also suggest where common legislation could give an additional
    European value, which can not be obtained by the parallel acting of
    15 - 25 different parliaments. If they propose a common regulation
    it must be because of added value, for they would lose the
    legislative power in their own parliament. They can only win from
    centralisation if they have nothing to loose. If their own democracy
    is powerless they can win a co-influence in an area where they
    otherwise would have no say. Centralisation in that case would then
    add to democracy instead of increasing the democratic deficit. And
    that shall always be the condition for accepting a decision from a
    higher level than the national parliament.

To balance sectors interests the adoption of the annual legislative
programme could be taken by for example 20 representatives of each
national parliament meeting on an ad hoc basis for example one week
twice a year. With 20 members from each parliament it will be possible
to include all political directions in the national delegations. They
could decide the legislative programme With legal bases for every
proposal for example with 75 % majority and representing 50 % of the
population. Then, the Commission can draft the proposals with the
binding character decided downwards up instead of the existing procedure
where it is always top down. Today all member states need to be
unanimous if they will alter a legal base proposed from the Commission.
It gives over centralisation a strong position.

-   The final decision on the annual legislative programme could be
    taken by the national parliaments in a yes/no vote. To be adopted
    the annual programme would need the support of 75 % of the Member
    State parliaments.

*\_Further initiatives for simplification and democratisation\_*

This downward-up system could be further underlined by giving the
national parliaments the right to appoint their national commissioner.
The commissioner could then meet with a European Committee of a national
parliament ones a week and listen and report. The wish to decentralise
could be further strengthened by giving every national parliament a
right to veto a proposal for binding European law as proposed by Georges
Berthoin, the former right hand of Jean Monnet.

-   The veto should be limited to vital issues the condition being that
    the prime minister is prepared to defend the veto in the next
    European summit. One could also demand a public reading and decision
    in the national parliament for those seldom occasions. With a veto
    right in vital questions it might be easier to make qualified
    majority vote the general rule for the necessary cross-frontier
    legislation. It could also facilitate clearness in decision making
    if the existing more than 30 different decision making methods were
    reduced to the two fundamentally different methods of common laws or
    co-ordination. Why continue with directives and regulations when
    there is no clear difference? Why not simply talk about a community
    LAW if it is binding according to the European Court. Then the
    national parliaments would know clearly the consequences when they
    decide if they want a common law. If a decision is not legally
    binding we do not need a lot of different words for that.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Keep it simple and call all non-binding decisions for
    recommendations. If the national parliaments don\'t call for a law
    they would then know that they them selves have the last word on
    what shall happen with the recommendation and they will be able to
    alter their decision at a later date after their own decision. The
    proposals here will give the national parliaments a strong position
    in defining legality, subsidiarity and proportionality. What about
    the citizens, companies and organisations? Could they have a legal
    access to question a proposal before it is decided? Why not open a
    possibility for questioning the proposed legal base in the annual
    programme?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The Court could then annul a proposal for law deciding that there is
    only a possibility for coordination through non binding
    recommendations or that their is no legal base at all because the
    proposal is outside the competencies assigned to the institutions by
    the treaties.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The distribution of competencies could be much clearer if all
    competencies were described in a more precise way in a so-called
    catalogue of competencies. This catalogue of competencies could then
    be changed for new needs only through clear procedures involving a
    unanimous decision by the national parliaments and eventual
    ratification. With these proposals the national parliaments will
    become the masters of European cooperation. Our elected
    representatives will have the last word over legality, subsidiarity
    and proportionality. That is what democracy is about.

## Selected Quotes {#selected_quotes}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*\"In a radical democracy in which everybody should be able to
co-decide, not everyone meets the [of](criteria "wikilink") competence,
preparedness to serve the common interest and economic independence.
That\'s why this form should be rejected. Every four years, the citizen
can give his judgement on government policy in all openness, and in this
manner have influence. For this, it is necessary however that the
citizen is well informed. That is a task of the government\"* \-- Frits
Bolkestein in: Lecture at the University of Amsterdam, 11 March 1997

*\"I am a proponent of representative and not of direct democracy. I
don\'t like referendums and all those things. Representatives are chosen
for an integrated rule, they have to be able to oversee everything.\"*
\-- Frits Bolkestein in: De Standaard Magazine, 28 February 1997

*\"We are in a democracy, and the commission itself is a collegiate
body,\" Torres said. \"And, of course, I do find that the commissioners
have, obviously, to have an opinion on such an important subject
[Turkey\'s accession](as "wikilink"). Whether they make it public or
whether they should make it public is another issue.\"* \-- Commission
Spokeswoman Torres, in [this article.

## Problems still persisting in the Constitution {#problems_still_persisting_in_the_constitution}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The power of the Council is preserved, the Europarl wins only very
    little (see section **How Council can decide with much smaller
    majorities** below)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A major bug is a short article about \"Intellectual property shall
    be protected\". After all, a constitution should protect citizens,
    not something as fuzzy as IP which is not a basic right but simply
    an economical instrument.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Will something called constitution indeed be adopted without a
    pan-european referendum ?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   However, the participation in european election was lower than 30 %
    in some member states. So how democratic would a referendum be ?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Better something that can be changed in the near future than no
    constitution at all.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The Commission and its Commissioners should be \'elected\' by the
    parliament, e.g. by a working coalition of the political parties in
    the parliament.

### How Council can decide with much smaller majorities {#how_council_can_decide_with_much_smaller_majorities}

*Contribution by Gibus*

Art I-23.3

` 3. The Council shall act by a qualified majority except`\
` where the Constitution provides otherwise.`

Art I-25 defines qualified majority:

` Article I-25`\
` Definition of qualified majority within the European`\
` Council and the Council`

1.  1.  A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of

` the members of the Council, comprising at least fifteen of them`\
` and representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the`\
` population of the Union. A blocking minority must include at`\
` least four Council members, failing which the qualified majority`\
` shall be deemed attained.`

` 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when the Council does`\
` not act on a proposal from the Commission or from the Union`\
` Minister for Foreign Affairs, the qualified majority shall be`\
` defined as at least 72 % of the members of the Council,`\
` representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the`\
` population of the Union.`

` 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply to the European Council when`\
` it is acting by a qualified majority.`

` 4. Within the European Council, its President and the President`\
` of the Commission shall not take part in the vote.`

Note that European Council is not the Council of Ministers (named here
simply \"Council\"), who is co-legislator (along with European
Parliament) in the software patents directive, thus paragraphs 3 and 4
don\'t apply to swpat directive. Note also, that more restrictive
criterium for qualified majority in paragraph 2. does not apply for
swpat directive.

Thus, with *only* Denmark, Poland, Portugal and others countries in
favour of B-item but not specified by Luxemburg presidency (but we know
that Spain, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Latvia and Neederland could be
included), the requirements for a qualified majority, as defined in
paragraph 1, for refusing a B-item should be easily reached *(could we
have confirmation of this point ?)*.

Nevertheless, refusal for B-item, implying removing of A-item, doesn\'t
need a qualified majority. I haven\'t found any reference to A-item or
B-item in the Treaty for an European Constituion. Thus, *my (Gibus)
interpretation* is that rules of procedures, as defined in [OJ
Art3](http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexdoc!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=EN&numdoc=32004D0338&model=lex "wikilink")
still apply:

`3.8. However, an "A" item shall be withdrawn from the agenda,`\
`unless the Council decides otherwise (...)`

It is up to the Council to decide. How ? It isn\'t specified, but it
isn\'t the Presidency\'will alone.

    German legal historical analysis of Laughland\'s Anti-EU Grossraum
    (C.Schmitt) polemics in the UK - while he agrees that Schmitt\'s
    theory applies partially as a positive description, he points out
    that the core of Schmitt\'S Grossraum concept translates to
    structural techno-economic \'power sphere\', and does not mean
    domination of the German State in particular.
