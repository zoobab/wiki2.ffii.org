`<phm >`{=html} That project isn\'t over \[20:18:04\] `<phm >`{=html} We
still don\'t have a multilingual data base with the amendments in it.
\[20:18:14\] `<phm >`{=html} And it\'s needed for reference.
\[20:18:42\] `<phm >`{=html} It will be a basis of a lot of discussions
in and around Council etc \[20:19:06\] `<gibus>`{=html} thanks phm,
i\'ve seen this page and send some missing french translations to gilles
\[20:19:10\] `<bkaindl>`{=html} ok, thanks for the explanation!
\[20:19:40\] `<phm >`{=html} I tried to put some things todo into
<http://swpat.ffii.org/group/todo/> \[20:19:45\] `<phm >`{=html} but
it\'s still very rough. \[20:19:47\] `<ijuz>`{=html} phm: i can do at
least one language, but is there a list of the syntax? you know for
lists for example \[20:20:45\] `<zoobab>`{=html} Preparations are under
way to withdraw the directive and legalise patents by means of an
agreement between national patent officials, who are used to deciding
patent policies among themselves. \[20:20:48\] `<phm >`{=html} Am17 \|
fr \| Tout logiciel est non-brevetable, sauf s\'il marche sur un
ordinateur. \... \[20:21:01\] `<zoobab>`{=html} do you use leaks about
that? \[20:21:09\] `<ccorn>`{=html} BTW, phm sent me account info to
submit translations directly to mlhtimport\@a2e.de. Questions: (1) Need
to uncomment the special tags lang, login, passwd? (2) txtlang instead
of lang (as in the template)? (3) Only uncomment changed text paragraphs
or all? I\'d then sent the result vial mailx, as suggested by phm.
\[20:21:44\] `<phm >`{=html} Special tags at bottom must start with \#
and end with ; \[20:22:00\] `<phm >`{=html} 2 yes 3 yes \[20:22:24\]
`<ccorn>`{=html} Thanks! \[20:22:56\] `<phm >`{=html} thank you.
\[20:23:58\] `<ijuz>`{=html} phm: no, i saw this, i\'m about this
\|%(linol\| stuff \[20:24:52\] `<phm >`{=html} That kind of structure is
explained at <http://swpat.ffii.org/langtxt/> \[20:25:29\]
`<phm >`{=html} Indeed with some amendments there are problems of
choosing the right markup. \[20:25:36\] `<phm >`{=html} But we needn\'t
worry about that at first. \[20:26:14\] `<ijuz>`{=html} is it not
\[20:26:35\] `<phm >`{=html} The explanations are very rough.
\[20:26:56\] `<phm >`{=html} %(al\|Non-Brevetabilite du Logiciel\|Tout
logiciel \...) \[20:27:22\] `<phm >`{=html} would mean: we have a
structure of paragraphs (alineae, separated by \|), \[20:27:28\]
`<ijuz>`{=html} yes, ok, i can guess them from other files, i just
thought that there might be some documentation somewhere \[20:28:03\]
`<phm >`{=html} Not many tags are needed, so I guess I should document
them in more detail at the named page. \[20:28:41\] `<gibus>`{=html}
.oO(one of these days you\'ll end up with XML) \[20:29:32\]
`<phm >`{=html} I came from SGML/XML and found it unwieldy for the
purpose of multilinguality managment \[20:30:01\] `<phm >`{=html} The
tags usually won\'t get very complicated in this system. \[20:30:08\]
`<gibus>`{=html} i know, i\'m on the traduk list and seen your comment
about that\... \[20:30:09\] `<ccorn>`{=html} Yep, XML is a wrist-breaker
(particularly [DocBook](DocBook "wikilink")) :-) \[20:30:10\]
`<phm >`{=html} Anything more complicated will be split into chunks.
\[20:30:30\] `<phm >`{=html} One problem with SGML is that it tries to
\[20:30:50\] `<phm >`{=html} put all text structures into one single
hierarchy. \[20:31:04\] `<phm >`{=html} The %(q:\...) tags etc are only
for structures at a very low level. \[20:31:28\] `<phm >`{=html} And
saying \"low\" is inaccurate, since they don\'t belong into one
hierarchy. \[20:31:29\] `<ijuz>`{=html} phm: ok, so something else
unclear: all amandments or the ones used in the plen0309 voting recom.
or the ones that where voted for? \[20:31:56\] `<phm >`{=html} I\'d say
it would be very good to have all amendments in a database. \[20:32:27\]
`<phm >`{=html} The Council people will claim that the EP chose poorly
crafted ones instead of well crafted ones. \[20:32:49\] `<phm >`{=html}
We will need to show that the alternatives are not better crafted but
simply in favor of unlimited patentability. \[20:33:13\] `<phm >`{=html}
They are trying to depict the EP as incompetent. \[20:33:28\]
`<phm >`{=html} and to say that those who can judge well-craftedness
should dictate the law. \[20:33:32\] `<ijuz>`{=html} ok, i\'ll do at
least the .de amandment database file \[20:33:45\] `<phm >`{=html} i.e.
turn this into a matter of legal technicality (not technicity) again.
\[20:34:09\] `<phm >`{=html} great, that will encourage people.
\[20:35:56\] `<gibus>`{=html} we have started a discussion by mail with
Michèle, Gilles and Cédric for french translations \[20:36:10\]
`<gibus>`{=html} thinks it\'s ok for us to translate to french
\[20:36:45\] `<phm >`{=html} yes, thanks to you the swpat.ffii.org site
now has better supply with french than with german texts. \[20:36:58\]
`<gibus>`{=html} :) \[20:37:50\] `<gibus>`{=html} are there others
priority (for french translation) than
<http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/kinv/>
<http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/prog/>
<http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/itop/> ? \[20:38:01\]
`<gibus>`{=html} (priorities) \[20:38:31\] `<phm >`{=html} also
<http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/reag/> \[20:39:04\]
`<phm >`{=html} This may need to be reference by people when talking to
politicians (national MPs) these days. \[20:39:29\] `<gibus>`{=html} ok
i\'ll add that on the french wiki, and try to do some later this night

# Further Hints for Translators {#further_hints_for_translators}

-   it seems, it is not possible to send a mail with multiple translated
    texts attached, things get screwed (in my case, one file got
    imported but at the wrong place and overwrote another file I sent
    in)
