------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Council of the EU has found a new formula for distribution of power
between the member state governments in the Council and thereby removed
one of the last obstacles to the adoption of the EU Constitution.

The last obstacle could be plebiscites in some countries such as UK and
Denmark.

-   [Euractiv
    report](http://www.euractiv.com/cgi-bin/cgint.exe/1798497-738?204&OIDN=1507895&-home=home "wikilink")

In discussions within FFII about the constitution, the following points
of criticism have been raised:

1.  The constitution perpetuates the current undemocratic system of the
    EU, wherein legislative power is wielded mainly by the Executive. It
    cements the EU as a \"Union of Councils\", i.e. a consiliar (soviet)
    union, where much of the legislative process takes place in the dark
    without supervision by any parliament (\--\> [ further
    analysis](EuKonstitCons04Fr "wikilink")).
2.  The constitutions says \"Intellectual property shall be protected\".
    This is bad legislation, because the concept of \"intellectual
    property\" is unclear and wide open to abusive definitions. It is
    primarily the interests, especially freedom interests, of citizens
    that deserve \"protection\", inter alia against abusive
    \"intellectual property\" claims (\--\> [ further
    analysis](EuKonstitProp04Fr "wikilink")).
3.  Some parts of the constitution seem to lock Europe even further into
    worldwide \"IP\" treaties and unelected organisms which add extreme
    interpretations to these treaties (\--\> [ further
    analysis](EuKonstitMond04Fr "wikilink")).

Further analysis is under preparation.
