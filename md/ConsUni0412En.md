The unilateral statements attached to the directive by various
countries.

(I guess we would need links to parliament motions as well.)

The statements are listed in increasing order of determinedness.

-   Hungary: [ConsUniHu0412En](ConsUniHu0412En "wikilink") (Happy with
    the directive. No mention of patentability of software. Emphasis on
    [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") needs. No goals in second reading stated.)

    the text, some parts are open to conflicting interpretations, will
    be careful in implementation)

```
-   Latvia: [ConsUniLv0412En](ConsUniLv0412En "wikilink") (Exclude

    abstain)
