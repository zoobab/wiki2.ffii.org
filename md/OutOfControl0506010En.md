# Open Letter for a tight Democratic Control of the Council of the Banana Union {#open_letter_for_a_tight_democratic_control_of_the_council_of_the_banana_union}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Dear Members of a National Parliament of Europe,

Your minister XXX has the heavy responsibility to open or not the flood
gates for software patents in Europe (1). Currently, in the complete
secrecy of their dark rooms, anonymous patent administrators of the
Council Working Group on Intellectual Property (Patents) are already
deciding the position of your country on this issue, without any control
from public eyes. When their proposal lays on the table in the Council,
it will be practically impossible for it to be changed. These officials
represent their national ministries but, due to the apparent technicity
of the matter, they are often selected among the staff of their national
patent offices. Since, most often, ministers follow their cabinets,
these officials have decisive power.

In the first reading of this directive, the official documents issued by
this Working Group have resulted in the most extreme text for unlimited
patentability of software and business methods (2), which has been
formally approved on last 7th March, the Luxembourg Presidency using an
unknown procedure to ignore the will of three countries which wanted to
reopen negotiations (3). Access to those documents was denied until the
very last minute \"due to the sensitive nature of the negotiations and
the absence of an overriding public interest\" (4).

The Luxembourg Presidency has proposed a very hurried agenda on which
anonymous patent administrators of each country should take position on
the amendments proposed by the Legal Affairs Comitee of the European
Parliament. This initiative of the Council will probably result in
weakening the transparent work of the Parliament, influencing Members of
the European Parliament to vote for amendments on which the Council
anonymous patent administrators can agree with.

The leaked minutes of the secret meetings organised last 27th May and
3rd June (5) show that most anonymous patent administrators still profit
from their anonymity by promoting the extension of patentability, in the
interests of the European and National Patent Offices, in which most of
them play an active role. It is not rare to find the same people who are
participating in those meetings at the Administration Board of the
European Patent Office.

Therefore, in light of the hurried agenda (6) defined by the Presidency,
we strongly urge you:

1.  to not give the Luxembourg Presidency a mandate for discussions on
    this issue if the position of your country has not been approved by
    your democratic assembly;
2.  to draft a resolution so as to ask an extension from 3 months to 4
    months for the Second Reading of the Council;
3.  to urgently schedule an agenda with discussions in your Parliament
    on this crucial issue for survival of a competitive and open
    information society.

We would be very happy to see democracy and transparency taking the step
over the dictatorship and the darkness of the most powerful body of the
European Union.

The undersigned,

Type your name here\"
