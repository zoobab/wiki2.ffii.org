# Charles E. Perkins\' interview by FFII {#charles_e._perkins_interview_by_ffii}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brussels, 3 and 4 may 2006, the first edition of the \"European
Inventor of the Year\" was held at the Hotel Le Plaza in with the gala
dinner and awards ceremony taking place at the Autoworld Museum on 3
May. Organised by both the European Commission and the European Patent
Office, the aim of this event is to promote software patents in Europe.
FFII couldn\'t miss this \"exceptional\" manifestation.

 One of the nominees in the non-European countries category was Charles
E. Perkins, who worked at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Centre in
Hawthorn, New York, when they developed mobile IP, enabling mobile
devices, such as laptop computers, to be moved between different
networks. \"To ensure safety for use in a corporate environment, he used
an encryption method, effectively blocking malicious code by
mathematically verifying messages that were intended for the addressee.
Hailed as the \"father of mobile IP technology\", the American inventor
won several IBM Invention Achievement Awards and a Service Award for
contributions to the Internet Architectural Board\".

## Here\'s a peace of the transcription of our interviews at the Autoworld. {#heres_a_peace_of_the_transcription_of_our_interviews_at_the_autoworld.}

o FFII: Hi ! I am actually representing FFII, a non-profit association
supporting the development of information goods for public benefit,
based on copyright, free competition, and open standards\... [having
shortly presented FFII, Benjamin introduces the problematic of software
patents in Europe](After "wikilink"). Do you know that in Europe
algorithms are supposed to be not patentable?

o Charles E. Perkins: I think that is a good idea.

o FFII: Are you aware that EPO delivers patents on algorithms?

o Charles E. Perkins: I am personally not aware that they do deliver
such patents\... But I think it must be the common practice of
industries such as Google or Nokia [he presently
works](where "wikilink") to request such patents. \[\...\] Developing a
program costs a lot of time and money, in a certain view the practice
may be comprehensible.

o FFII: \[\...\] Do you think it is a good solution for Europe to make
algorithms patentable? Is there another adequate solution to really
promote innovation and make Europe competitive?

o Charles E. Perkins: it\'s a problematic question because developing
software is really expensive and patent seems to be the sole solution to
protect innovation\...

o FFII: Have you heard about the [BlackBerry](BlackBerry "wikilink")
case [in Motion Ltd., maker of the [BlackBerry](BlackBerry "wikilink")
mobile device, has just countersued Visto Corp., a software company that
sued RIM last week over patents on wireless e-mail](Research "wikilink")
?

o Charles E. Perkins: Yes. It is quite an odd story\...

Laughs

\[\...\]

o FFII: Last year an European Commission directive making software
patentable failed. Have you heard about the new project of European
Commission directive concerning the idea of Community patent? The
project is especially promoted by Nokia, Alcatel, Siemens\... Another
issue into which such groups are involved is the EPLA [Patent Litigation
Agreement](European "wikilink"), another subtle way to make software
patentable\...

o Charles E. Perkins: Well. I work for Nokia\... I think they only want
to have certain level of IPR protection. They simply want to have the
same ability to compete with the other groups\... I don\'t believe they
have a specific interest into promoting patent software\...

o FFII: The problem is that EPO (European Patent Office) have granted
software patents. But theoretically, software are not patentable
referring to European Patent Convention (Munich, 1973). Software as
other intellectual creations cannot be patented\...

o Charles E. Perkins: I think it is a good thing [not being
patentable](software "wikilink").

o FFII: \...But EPO interprets the sphere of exceptions narrowly and
considers that \"computer-implemented invention\" (or software having a
\"further technical effect\") is patentable.

o Charles E. Perkins: Well, I am not a lawyer, it seems to me a very
complicated situation.

o FFII: The problem is that EPO is a non-European institution\...

\[\...\]

Briefly, it appears that the one tends to consider that software in
itself should not be patented though at the same time he reckons the
necessity of protecting the expensive process of developping software.
