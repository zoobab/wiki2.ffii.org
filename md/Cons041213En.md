1.  1.  on Tuesday it will be discussed by the Mertens group, which
        prepares the meetings for the Coreper; the Coreper meeting
        itself is on Wednesday) (jmaebe)

*Brussels, 14 December 2004 \--* Diplomats of the EU Council will decide
on Tuesday and Wednesday whether the Council\'s Software Patent
Agreement of May 2004 will be passed by the upcoming Fishery or
Environment Council meetings, the last ones of this year. Contrary to
recent information given by the Belgian government, the Dutch Presidency
is apparently still trying to push through the text from last May as an
A-item, i.e. without discussion and without vote. The published
justifications for throwing away all of the European Parliament\'s
substantial amendments range from the [longtime debunked (\"TRIPs
requires software
patents\")](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trips/index.en.html "wikilink")
to the downright absurd (\"politicians must not change established
practice\").

A recently published [Council
agenda](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st15/st15967.en04.pdf "wikilink")
(page 2, item 5) notes that the adoption of the Council\'s text from May
will be discussed by the
[Mertens](http://www.ukrep.be/jargon.html "wikilink") group on Tuesday.
This group prepares the meetings of Coreper, which in turn prepares the
meetings of the Council. The only Council meetings left under the Dutch
Presidency are one on Environment on 20 December and one on Agriculture
and Fisheries on 21-22 December.

1.  1.  do we have any information at all that other governments also
        tried to bully Poland?
    2.  I deleted \"and other governments\" from the paragraph below for
        now (jmaebe)

The Dutch Presidency has been using diplomatic pressure to [ bully
Poland](Nlpl0411En "wikilink"). Although everyone knows that neither the
Polish government nor the Polish industry supports the directive text,
the Dutch Presidency insists that, due to some [ formal
reasons](ConsReversEn "wikilink"), Poland must vote \"Yes\" or agree to
a formal adoption without a vote. However, as has been pointed out
before and as verified with the Council\'s own public information
service, any country has the right to demand that the directive text
should be treated again as a B item (i.e., as a discussion point).

Laura Creighton, software entrepreneur, venture capitalist and
vice-president of FFII, comments:

`"Before today it was possible for generous people to look charitably at this`\
`text as an example of a tragic mistake, not malice. But not with this`\
`last-minute maneuvering. Only the most committed opponent to the democratic`\
`process would believe that the proper response to the widespread consensus`\
`that there is something profoundly wrong with the Council's text, is to race`\
`it through with an A-item approval the week before Christmas in a __Fisheries__`\
`Council Meeting. The bad smell coming from Brussels has nothing to do with`\
`the fish."`

Mag. Othmar Karas, MEP of the Austrian People\'s Party (ÖVP) and Vice
President of the European People\'s Party (EPP) in the European
Parliament, recently lambasted the Council\'s behaviour as well [in a
press
release](http://www.othmar-karas.at/ok.php?ok=new_presse_zeigen.php&id=226 "wikilink"):

`"The planned directive on software patents no longer has a majority in the`\
`Council. The political agreement of May is outdated, both because of the`\
`new voting weights stipulated by the Nice treaty and because of the changes`\
`of position in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany."`

A [ draft statement of reasons](Cons041203En "wikilink") proposed by the
Dutch Presidency has to justify this defiance of democratic decision
making. It claims that a large number of the European Parliament\'s
amendments \"did not reflect established practice\" or \"would be
contrary to the international obligations under the [TRIPs
agreement](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trips/index.en.html "wikilink")\".

1.  1.  link to static trips page is better

Hartmut Pilch, president of the FFII, notes:

`"The Dutch presidency seems to be avoiding conflicts by preparing an`\
`explanatory document that explains as little as possible. They do not`\
`explain which kinds of patent claims should be acceptable and which not,`\
`which interests are served thereby and which not and why. They merely`\
`point to the European Patent Office as the authority. One may wonder`\
`whether this is the intention of a qualified majority. Also, the Dutch`\
`presidency adds the `[`TRIPs`](TRIPs "wikilink")` fallacy. They could just as well have added a`\
`statement that the earth is flat."`

Jonas Maebe of FFII Belgium adds:

`"One group of amendments from the European Parliament is dismissed by the`\
`Council with the simple justification that they "did not reflect`\
`established practice". Let's hope for the Council's sake that the European`\
`Parliament does not ever again get the idea that they can submit proposals`\
`which actually change things."`

It is not yet known whether Poland will bow to the pressure. Poland\'s
diplomats at the Council have, ever since May 2004, contradicted their
government\'s repeated statements of opposition to the directive draft.
They have always insisted on unwritten rules of diplomacy whose
violation, they fear, would be disadvantageous to Poland.

## Further Comments {#further_comments}

[ Andre Rebentisch](AndreRebentischEn "wikilink") comments:

As we found out it is [ no ius nondum to change your council
voting](ConsReversEn "wikilink"). In fact there is no formal obligation
to stick to a \"political agreement\" that is obsolete. Adoption of
obsolete agreements in fact contradicts the whole concept of **political
agreements** as an informal part of the decision making process. However
the Nl presidency insists on non-existing council rules. They are doing
the exact opposite of what a [ 2/3 majority of their Parliament asked
them to do](NlVote040701En "wikilink").

### Jozef Halbersztadt {#jozef_halbersztadt}

Jozef Halbersztadt works as a patent examiner at Polish Patent Office.
The Polish Patent Office has resisted pressure from the European Patent
Office to allow software patents and is one of the most fervent
opponents of the Council\'s text, which it fears would plunge it into a
quagmire of broad and trivial patents on abstract subject matter.
Halbersztadt has watched the EU developments for many years and draws
the following analogy to the Ukrainian presidential elections:

\"We could see our fight in terms of Ukrainian presidential election.
Yanukovych was picked as a candidate by the current president, Kuchma,
in return for guarantees to the president and his allies of immunity
from prosecution for all his crimes, committed while in power, as well
as protection of their assets gained through manipulated privatisation.
The Ukrainian people were fed up and voted him down. And they were
denied their victory by a group of crooks.

Our scenario is similar. We have won in the European Parliament. We are
now denied victory by manipulation and irregularities in the Council.
The Kuchmas of the EU don\'t like consultation with national
parliaments, recounting in the Council or restarting in the EP, nor any
other open approach to problems. The main difference is that they \-\--
hopefully \-\-- aren\'t considering deployment of troops and use of
force.\"
