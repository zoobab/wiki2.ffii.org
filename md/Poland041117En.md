Joint Press Release

Poland Does Not Support Current Proposal for EU Software Patent
Directive

Official statement on government website after cabinet meeting: \"Poland
cannot support the text which was agreed upon by the EU Council\" -
Political agreement of May 18th on a proposed directive can no longer be
formally adopted as the common position of the EU Council

Warsaw, 17 November 2004. Subsequently to a cabinet meeting, the Polish
government officially declared yesterday evening that \"Poland cannot
support the text that was agreed upon by the EU Council on May 18th,
2004\" as a proposal for a \"directive on the patentability of
computer-implemented inventions\". Consequently, the EU Council is
unable to formally adopt that legislative proposal as its common
position. Without the support of Poland, those countries that supported
the proposal in May now fall short of a qualified majority by 16 votes.
New voting weights took effect in the EU on the 1st of this month.

After extensive consultations with organizations of IT professionals and
the Polish Patent Office, the Polish cabinet concluded that the proposal
at hand does not achieve the stated goals of limiting patents on
software and business methods in Europe. The Polish government explained
that it would \"definitely\" support \"unambiguous regulations\" but not
a directive under which the functionality of computer programs could be
patented. The EU Commission and various governments of other EU member
countries claimed that the legislative proposal would not allow for the
patentability of programs that run on an average personal computer.
However, at a meeting hosted by the Polish government on the 5th of this
month, everyone including representatives of the Polish Patent Office,
SUN, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, as well as various patent
lawyers, confirmed that the present proposal of the EU Council does make
all software potentially patentable.

Jan Macek of FFII Poland said: \"Countries such as Luxembourg, Latvia,
Denmark and Italy had called for changes similar to the amendments made
by the European Parliament, but those were rejected by the then-Irish
presidency. They now have a chance to propose their amendments again,
with support from Poland. That will help bring the directive more in
line with the European Parliament which took the position of clearly
disallowing software and business method patents.\"

Wladyslaw Majewski, president of the Internet Society of Poland,
emphasized the economic and societal implications of software patents:
\"The questionnable compromise that the EU Council reached in May was
the biggest threat ever to our economic growth, and to our freedom of
communication. The desire of the patent system and the patent
departments of certain large corporations must never prevail over the
interests of the economy and society at large.\"

The political agreement of the EU Council had been under heavy criticism
ever since it was announced on May 18th. Politicians from all parts of
the democratic spectrum, small and medium-sized enterprises, software
developers and economists called on the EU Council to reconsider its
position. Deutsche Bank Research and
[PriceWaterhouseCoopers](PriceWaterhouseCoopers "wikilink") had
expressly warned of the negative consequences to European IT companies,
to innovation, and to the ability of the EU to achieve the goals set out
in its Lisbon Agenda. On July 1st, the Dutch parliament passed a
resolution that its government change the position of the Netherlands
from support to an abstention. On October 21st, all four groups in the
German parliament spoke out against software patents and the legislative
proposal in question, and introduced different motions to that effect.
