*The Swedish Agency for Public Procurement, British school authorities,
German municipal administrations, labor and health authorities and even

## Outline

Governments are among the most active centers of pro-patent lobbying,
because the governmental patent institutions control the legislative
process based on their community\'s belief system, without much
effective challenge from other agencies or the public.

A prominent case of conflict within governments is in pharmaceuticals:
one branch encourages patents to stimulate innovation (which they
probably often really do in the case of pharmaceuticals), while another
branch tries to cut government spending by refusing to reimburse patient
costs for patented medicines.
