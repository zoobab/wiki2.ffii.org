*Brussels, 13th February. \-- From all over Europe, software developers
and company representatives will join forces in Brussels on Thursday,
February 17th to demonstrate against the possible legalization of
software patents in Europe. This will be followed by a Press Conference
in which representatives from the European Parliament, from national
parliaments and from the corporate world will present their views on the
proposed European directive.*

The organizers point out that on that day a number of important
decisions will be taken about the proposed directive. Firstly, the
German \"Bundestag\" will vote that evening on a motion in which the EU
commission and the EU council of Ministers will receive harsh critique
over their behavior in this matter. Secondly, the EU parliament will
formally request the European Commission to restart the entire
procedure.

Originally, a vote was also planned on the 17th of February in the
Council of Ministers of Finance on a heavily contested text that would
have opened the gates for unlimited patentability of software. Bowing to
heavy pressure from the Dutch parliament, the Danish government and the
Spanish senate, this plan is currently postponed. This has lead to
serious dissatisfaction in the European Commission.

Nevertheless, demonstration on 17th of February will proceed as planned.
Dieter Van Uytvanck, spokesperson for the FFII, explains:

` Of course, we are very pleased with the decision of the Council to`\
` not continue to pursue its proposal, that is actually no longer`\
` supported by a majority in the Council itself. But, we should`\
` remember that this is only by virtue of the brave national`\
` parliaments and the EU Parliament.`

` The Council and the Commission have demonstrated over and over again`\
` that they do not show the slightest respect for the European`\
` citizen. Over and over again, they continue to promote software`\
` patents with a complete neglect of the opposing voices from a large`\
` majority in the EU parliament. Enough is enough, and on 17 February,`\
` they will know it!`

Criticism on the proposed software patents is heard from many sides.
SME\'s, consumer organizations, academics and software developers claim
that software is very well protected already by the existing copyright
system and the software patents lead to the creation of excessive
monopolies and an uncertain business climate.

## Practical information {#practical_information}

The demonstration starts at 9:30 am at the Justus Lipsius building,
Wetstraat/Rue de la Loi 175, in Brussels (near the metro station
