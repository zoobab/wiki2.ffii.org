\"Mar 16-17: A delegation led by Chris Israel, U.S. Coordinator for
Intellectual Property Enforcement, visited Brussels to participate in
the second meeting of the newly established U.S.-EU Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR) Working Group. The delegation also included
officials from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Trade
Representative, and the State Department, Commerce Department and
Department of Homeland Security. During the meeting, U.S. and EU
officials met with European stakeholders to discuss how business and
government could work together to address their IPR enforcement
priorities. The U.S. and the EU also discussed specifics of an action
plan on transatlantic coordination. The first meeting of the U.S.-EU IPR
Working Group, established by the U.S.-EUs Economic Ministerial in
November 2005, took place in Washington, D.C. on January 26-27.\"

The EU, United States and India also joined hands to fight a coalition
of developing countries, including South Africa, Venezuela, Kenya and
the Philippines, that want to limit the multinationals\' access to their
services markets. South Africa proposed that each country would
negotiate with each of the other members of the WTO. But the Deputy US
Trade Representative, Susan Schwab, retorted that talks about services
markets were becoming abstruse even by WTO standards. An acrimonious
debate arose over the extent to which countries should be required to
let foreign competitors into their markets for services like banking,
telecommunications, hospital management and computer programming.

SCHWAB: Thank you. Is this the end of the Doha round as we know it? No,
not yet. Too early to make that prediction, and we\'re still hopeful.
We\'ve got a year to go. We had greater ambitions for Hong Kong than
have been realized, but that doesn\'t mean that we aren\'t in a position
to move the ball forward.

On your question as to bilateral negotiations, the economist in me feels
very strongly that multilateral agreements, particularly
trade-liberalizing agreements, are much more beneficial. That said, free
trade agreements \-- bilateral or groups of countries \-- can be used
very, very effectively to meet ambitions, to create precedents in areas
like services or intellectual property, to go further than
lowest-common-denominator solutions.
