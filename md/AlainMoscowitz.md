We expect more \"joint statements\" of \"the industry\" with
\"associations representing millions of consumers in Europe\", jointly
asking for software patents and opposing the European Parlament\'s vote,
to be sent confidentially to heads of governments in Europe, as has been
done in recent months. Alain Moscowitz seems to be playing the role of
Graham Taylor.
