Just wondering whether you\'ve considered the [DjVu](DjVu "wikilink")
format for your work? DjVu is a free, open-source library designed to
efficiently compress scanned documents, and it includes OCR capability.
The result is a small file with features such as progressive loading
(e.g. over the Web), full text search, and faithful reproduction of both
text and images (by virtue of automatically segmenting the document and
using different compression techniques on each). See
<http://www.djvuzone.org/> to check it out.
