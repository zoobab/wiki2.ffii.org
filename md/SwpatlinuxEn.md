# Linux and Software Patents {#linux_and_software_patents}

\--\> \[ [ OSRM](OsrmEn "wikilink") \| [

[ OSRM](OsrmEn "wikilink") says that the Linux kernel infringes on 283
US software patents, most of which could probably be defeated in court.

Linux kernel developper Linus Torvalds has consistently warned of the
danger of software patents and yet advised developers to tackle the
threats as they come rather than try to steer around each patent, which
would be tantamount to giving up Linux development.

Microsoft has been targetting Linux with a large patent portfolio and an
aggressive licensing policy which excludes free software from use of the
ideas which they have patented, and with warnings that coroporate Linux
users are exposed to patent dangers.
