\|\| Rocard \|\| ++ \|\| The competitive position of Community industry
in relation to its major trading partners will be improved if the
current differences in the legal protection of computer-controlled
inventions are eliminated and the legal situation is transparent. The
present trend for traditional manufacturing industry to shift their
operations to low-cost economies outside the Community, as well as the
requirements for sustainable and balanced development, are factors to be
taken into account when determining an appropriate level of intellectual
property protection and in particular patent protection for technical
inventions and copyright protection for software. The level of this
protection, as well as the monopolistic effects it might create should
be determined in a manner that will not prejudice the dynamics of
competition and cross-fertilisation which are the key to the development
of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union
with easy market access, which will serve to ensure the Community\'s
future competitiveness. \|\| \|\| 247 \|\| Lichtenberger, Frassoni \|\|

248 correctly deletes the Commission and Council\'s strange logic that
introducing software patents will help against or compensate for
outsourcing manufacturing. In fact, software patents make it more easy
to outsource software R&D as well, since this allows such companies to
gain European exclusion rights on their foreign software R&D (so it
becomes harder for the left-behind European workforce to compete with
them). Multinationals such as Philips are already outsourcing software
R&D to China today, simply because China has a very highly trained and
cheap workforce (and at the same time they want \"protection\" in Europe
from the same Chinese companies who make use of that same workforce to
develop products).

20 (= 247, except for \"computer-controlled\" instead of
\"computer-assisted\") adds additional nuances to the recital, noting
that clarification of the law in itself is no guarantee for improved
competitiveness (e.g., making it clear that software must be patentable
would not be better than being in doubt over whether or not that is the
case).
