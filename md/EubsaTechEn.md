*The Europen Commission and European Patent Office started their
software patent legislation project in 1997 with the explicit intention
of \"harmonisation\" with the US and Japan and using business method
patents to stimulate economic growth. Later the wording was changed but
the substance remained. We show this for the proposal of the European
Parliament\'s Legal Affairs Commission of July 2003, which was
subsequently overruled by the Plenary of the Parliament. The same is
however true of the proposal of the Council\'s Political Agreement of
May 2004, whose wording is largely identical to that of JURI.*
