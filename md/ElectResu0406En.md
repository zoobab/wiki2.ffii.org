## Preliminary Analysis {#preliminary_analysis}

### Summary

In most countries the patent-critical forces were strengthened.

EPP (conservatives and christian democrats) is still the strongest group
but the parties of the pro-patent hardliners [
Wuermeling](SwpatjwuermelingEn "wikilink") and [
Harbour](SwpatmharbourEn "wikilink") were both weakened by 7-10%
(despite opposition role against unpopular national government) and [
Fourtou](SwpatjfourtouEn "wikilink")\'s party was cut to only half the
size of the French Socialists, to whom the software patent critics owe
very much. Eastern Europe is likely to strengthen the growing camp of
critics within EPP.

### EU-wide Parties {#eu_wide_parties}

Within these groups, only the small ones have unified positions on
software patentability, mostly siding with FFII. The large groups were
weakened, and within them the patent-critical national parties were
strengthened. This trend would be even more apparent if the new member
states were taken out of the statistics.

## Comments

### Hartmut Pilch (ffii) {#hartmut_pilch_ffii}

While on many issues the parties are indistinguishable from each other,
the software patent issue showed clear differences, and many opinion
leaders within the electorate took note. It became apparent which
parties are willing to treat legislative issues in a responsible way.
Failure of an organisation to use its members\' brains is often a
symptom of an organisational illness, and such illnesses will lead to
other failures and ultimately to losses in elections. It is nice to see
this fact reflected so clearly this time.
