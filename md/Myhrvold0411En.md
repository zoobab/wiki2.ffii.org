# 2004-11-15 MSNBC on Myhrvold: Megacorps creating their own Patent Trolls {#msnbc_on_myhrvold_megacorps_creating_their_own_patent_trolls}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Myhrvold\'s \"Intellectual Ventures\" is buying up thousands of patents
with money from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Sony, Nokia, Apple,
Google and eBay, in an attempt to create a large patent portfolio. One
of the reasons is to buy out small patent trolls, so the big companies
do not have to fear lawsuits from them. Another is however obviously
offensive usage (royalty extraction), given the fact that \"they charge
that Silicon Valley companies have stolen other people\'s inventions for
too long\". A Silicon Valley VC notes \"We\'re concerned that these
giant pools of patent rights are going to prevent entrepreneurs from
entering markets, as opposed to being used to promote innovation\".
