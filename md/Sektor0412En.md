## Areas of Concern for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and FFII {#areas_of_concern_for_smes_and_ffii}

### Preventing Monopolism & Proprietarisation of Infrastructures {#preventing_monopolism_proprietarisation_of_infrastructures}

-   open standards important, skeptical about vendor lock-in of
    Microsoft & the like
-   in favor of an [ integrated system of Intellectual Property which is
    fast, cheap and narrow](IndpropEn "wikilink"), critical of patents
-   critical of activities that raise state quota, for lean taxation
    systems, low or no taxes on information goods, but positive about
    state involvement in basic research, open infrastructures and
    education
-   cautiously skeptical about some extensions to the free trade agenda
    that deprive local communities of their space of maneuver and tend
    to favor monopolistation by big players. GATS and Bolkestein Service
    Directive have this aspect.
-   need to learn more about these things

### Counter-Balancing Legislative Capture by Professional Groups {#counter_balancing_legislative_capture_by_professional_groups}

-   patent lawyers have been speaking in the name of large companies
    without many people noticing
-   Large companies have more specialised departments than
    [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")
-   Grassroots education efforts with Internet means
-   Conferences with MERIT, CEAPME et al
