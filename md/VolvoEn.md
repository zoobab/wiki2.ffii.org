*Volvo, formerly Sweden\'s national automotive champion, is now part of
the Ford group. Volvo has almost no activities in the area of software
patenting, even in a wide sense. Yet Volvo has written letters to the
European Parliament claiming that its interests would be seriously
threatened if the Parliament did not give its support to the software
patenting practise of the European Patent Office. Volvo is also part of
the Swedish Entreprise Association, which has campaigned for the same
position.*

## Volvo patents {#volvo_patents}

We have searched the whole EPO patent database and found only 6 Volvo
patent applications which we suspect of being sofware-related. While
none of these was granted so far by the EPO, most of them qualify as
patentable subject matter under the European Parliament\'s postion of
September 2003. This fact all the more underlines that Volvo does not
have a genuine interest in this field but is just carelessly lending its
name for abuse by the patent lawyer network.
