## Power-to-the-Parliament domain registration {#power_to_the_parliament_domain_registration}

-   [DnsPttp0507En](DnsPttp0507En "wikilink"): FFII has registered the
    domains power-to-the-parliament.org et al. Configuration of
    power-to-the-parliament.org will be handled by our admin team. the
    \*.eu domains have also been pre-registered and will have to be
    confirmed as soon as the .eu TLD is officially launched.

## Some things to do {#some_things_to_do}

-   [ Current thank you page](EmDank0507En "wikilink") is very
    rudimentary
-   The power-to-the-parliament.org domain is available to be used for
    thanking.
-   [ Call for Action IV](Cpedu0507En "wikilink"): rally behind 21
    cross-partisan amendments
-   [ EP Speech transcriptions](ParlTrans050705En "wikilink") to be
    completed
-   More systematic commemoration needs to be worked on. Various
    audiences need books about the software patent fight put on their
    table. FMueller has been working on a book for the politically
    interested masses. Another one for patent judges is needed.
    note(arebenti): consider <http://www.bod.de/> for conference
    proceedings. Lenz also published there afaik.

-   Individual speeches need to be forked out into subpages like
