------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Polish Institute convened a conference on software patents in
Prague on Monday November 21st. Protagonists from Czechia, Poland and
from the EU directive debate explained the problems of software patents,
of EU policy, of social mobilisation and gave an outlook to the future
of the European software patent struggle. The ambience, the food and
simultaneous interpreting between Polish, Czech and English were all
very pleasant. Video footage of the event will be published by the
Polish Institute.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Panel 1: What is wrong with software patents {#panel_1_what_is_wrong_with_software_patents}

-   Polish greeting speeches from amabassador and institute director
    explained why their country got involved.
-   Jozef Halbersztadt from Polish Patent Office: EPO grants 90% of US
    software patent claims without change. Polish Patent Office has been
    partially resisting, and the courts also have woken up and issued
    decisions which resist the EPO line. The political mobilisation has
    been instrumental for this.
-   Reinier Bakels introductory lecture on broad coverage of \"ideas,
    not inventions\" by software patents
-   Czech patent office spokesman Jaroslav Kozak explained that the
    directive only aimed to harmonise the status quo.
-   Josef Sima, economist from Charles University, explained
    [Machlup](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/machlup58/ "wikilink") was
    right, patent system is ill-conceived, springs from a tradition of
    state-granted privileges, is not promoting innovation and
    competition today.

### Panel 2: What is wrong with the EU\'s legislative procedures {#panel_2_what_is_wrong_with_the_eus_legislative_procedures}

-   Hartmut Pilch narrates history of European software patent lawmaking
    from 1973 to 2004
-   Jan Macek, substituting Wlodzimierz Marcinski, narrates Polish role
    starting on [ 2004-05-18](Cons040518En "wikilink")
-   Jaroslav Popilek from Czech IT Ministry states that Czech government
    only wanted to harmonise the status quo, that EP position would have
    broken the patent system, that legislative attempts are continuing,
    that it was an error to make a special law about software, and that
    EU lawmaking is all about finding compromises between states.
-   Jiri Jirsa, assistant of Zuzanna Roithova MEP, says Council\'s
    behaviour on this directive had little in common with democratic
    lawmaking, that things would have been better under the EU
    constitution; suggests that the EU needs a cheaper unified patent
    system and to solve the software problem in this framework.
-   In discussion, Pilch questions how much the EU constitution could
    really have changed, and asks for some clarifications on the
    Community Patent, which two speakers seemed to have alluded to, and
    as to how it could solve (rather than perpetuate) the software
    problem.

### Panel 3: How did media and society get involved {#panel_3_how_did_media_and_society_get_involved}

-   Polish magazine publisher Edwin Bendyk explains how in Poland the
    right people came together at the right time
-   Ales Cepek, president of FFII.cz, explains how his group campaigned,
    how they sent news to journalists but found it difficult to arouse
    interest.
-   Owner of Czech publishing house computerpress.cz Jiri Hlavenka
    compares successes and shortcomings of various internet campaigns
    and says that software patent campaign failed to reach critical mass
    in CZ. A heated debate occurs with some participants from FFII.cz
    who felt that they did what they could but for some other reason
    computerpress.cz was spreading pro-patent propaganda. Hlavenka
    objects, saying that his publishing house wishes FFII.cz\'s
    campaigning efforts the best possible success and tries to report
    neutrally.
-   Pilch briefly enumerates some mobilisation successes and failures,
    from <http://petition.eurolinux.org> to
    <http://economic-majority.com> and
    <http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/> and the attac campaign of this
    year; acknowledges that, at least as far as ffii.org was concerned,
    media work was not its strong point.

### Panel 4: Where to go from here {#panel_4_where_to_go_from_here}

-   Jirsa explains plans for patent reform and community patent
-   Pilch: the directive became \"our directive\" twice during the
    process, once in September 2003, once in July 2005, when the [21
    compromise
    amendments](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/komprom0506.en.pdf "wikilink")
    made the breakthrough, thanks specially to Polish and Czech efforts
    in EP. These amendments provide a peer-reviewed and practise-proven
    solution to the problem that has everything which the EPO practise
    does not have: desirable results, clarity and legitimacy. This
    message needs to be brought to the patent community. A community
    patent might be ok if at the same time the European Parliament is
    simultaneously put in sole charge of the conditions of
    patent-granting, i.e. substantive patent law. This would require an
    amendment to the EC treaty.
-   Bakels explains continued need for an IPR counter-lobby
-   Halbersztadt seconds Pilch on 21 compromise amendments, explains how
    they were reviewed and approved by polish scholars of patent law
-   A question from the organiser Anna Godlewska leads fo further, more
    specific comments from all 4 speakers on what they intend to do in
    the future
