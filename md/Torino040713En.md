-   phm is participating i a two day conference at Turin Polititechnical
    University on IP & Knowledge Society
    -   -   venue: Fondazione Agnelli, Via Giacosa 38 (Agnelli family
            \--\> Fiat)
        -   [full program](http://cyberlaw.ieiit.cnr.it/ "wikilink")
-   the university in this industrial center of Italy has produced many
    studies that show how innovation and scientific progress are
    increasingly unlikely to benefit from the patent system.
    -   -   these studies were laid out at the conference table
        -   language of the studies and the conference is Italian,
            phm\'s presentation is also in Italian
        -   an interdisciplinary group of researchers has grown and
            created a center of competence on \"IP\" matters that acts
            as a counter-weight to the usual simplistic IP propaganda
            and has an influence on politicians
        -   politicians and diplomats, some of whom represent IT in
            Consilium, are present
        -   it appears that Italy s efforts to counter the patent lobby
            in the Council are deep rooted, but so far the diplomats
            often feel weak and discouraged in face of an overwhelming
            majority of patent believers from other countries
