*\*Correction:\* the original text stated René Stockner currently still
is global manager for Microsoft Navision. This is incorrect, he gave up
that job when he became CEO of Giritech. We apologise for spreading
outdated information in this regard.*

*25 April 2005 \-- Apparently unable to find enough independent small
and medium-sized enterprises SME//s to lobby for software patents, EICTA
has resorted to sending companies to the European Parliament in which
its multinational members hold a strong position. Additionally, several
SME//s who were inspired by this action and signed EICTA\'s appeal turn
out not to have any software patents at all.*

\"The patent system in Europe has worked well for us in the past\", says
Jan Ishøj Nielsen, CEO of !PremiTech A/S. However, he forgets to mention
that his company\'s first European software patent is still waiting to
be granted (its US cousin is already valid) and that the Chairman of the
Board of his company is Klaus Holse Andersen, VP Microsoft Business
Solutions EMEA. Mr. Andersen was previously also CEO of the investment
company IVS, another signatory of EICTA\'s demands.

Apart from sending !SMEs to Brussels, EICTA also organised a letter
writing campaign to the European Parliament. While for most companies
the CEO has signed this letter, in case of Giritech the CTO observes the
honours. One reason for this might be that the CEO of Giritech, René
Stockne, was global manager for Microsoft Navision until November 2004.
This is the same Microsoft Navision that threatened the Danish
government during that same month with moving out of Denmark if the
software patents do not come through.

Jonas Maebe, FFII Board Member, comments:

`It is really sad how low EICTA is sinking here. Unable to factually`\
`counter the resistance to software patents from real SME associations`\
`such as UEAPME and CEAPME, they are now resorting to dressing up`\
`Microsoft as an SME. "Oh, grandmother, what big teeth you have got"`\
`indeed.`

Some other companies that signed the letter and which are not tied to
any big firms, have simply been improperly informed about the reach of
the European Parliament\'s amendments. For example, Te Strake, an
innovative Dutch SME active in the field of \"mechatronics\", owns
several patents on inventions related to automated weaving. According to
an analysis performed by the FFII, all of their patents would remain
enforceable under the directive as approved by European Parliament in
first reading.

Hartmut Pilch, President of the FFII, comments on the results of FFII\'s
preliminary analysis:

`Preliminary research shows that most of these companies own less than`\
`a handful of patents and that the claimed solutions either involve`\
`forces of nature and are largely unaffected by the Parliament's first`\
`reading, or are in the realm of abstract problem descriptions or`\
`business methods and thus should, according to these companies' own`\
`"Manifesto", not be patentable.`

Nevertheless, the fact that EICTA\'s tactics work to a certain extent
was demonstrated last week at the European Parliament\'s Legal Affairs
Committee (JURI) meeting. A number of !MEPs there was convinced that
most !SMEs do want software patents, and that \"only programmers\"
oppose them. The FFII therefore urgently calls upon the real !SMEs to
stand up and to make their voice heard in Brussels.
