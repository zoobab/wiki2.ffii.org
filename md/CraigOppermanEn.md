------------------------------------------------------------------------

Craig Opperman is one of the US patent lawyers with a particular
interest in European legislation and, according to one publication,
particularly close relations to the European Commission. Yet Opperman
can speak quite bluntly, without the doublespeak of European software
patent promoters, about the matter.

## To Do {#to_do}

A few years ago there the Opperman website had a text which boasted
about \"excellent contacts to the European Commission\", which aroused a
stir on the [patent at aful org
forum](http://www.aful.org/wws/arc/patents "wikilink") around 2001 and
was later removed. We need to find this again and check whether we are
talking about the same Opperman.

## Comments Opperman {#comments_opperman}

Not the same Opperman. I have no particular contacts with the EPO.
