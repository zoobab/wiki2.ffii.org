Toine Manders, \"intellectual property expert\" of the European
Parliament\'s Liberal (ALDE/ELDR) group, member of the Bolkestein party
(VVD) from the Netherlands, habitually sides with lobbies that favor
stronger enforcement of the broadest possible \"intellectual property\"
rights. When such a position becomes indefensible within the EP Liberal
group, Manders tries to take an approach of rejecting it on procedural
or other formalistic grounds.

-   2004-02-00 Manders fights hard in favor of [IPR enforcement

-   2004-09-00 Manders fights hard for Bolkestein line on software
    patent directive but is forced to compromise.
-   2004-06-17 Manders recommends both an amendment in favor of program
    claims and one in favor of freedom of publication to his party in
    JURI vote, with the result that freedom of publication isn\'t put to
    vote because program claims are (correctly) thought of by JURI as
    excluding the latter. In other words: Manders uses legal tricks to
    fool his party group into supporting a pro-patent line which they
    don\'t want to support.
