# European Court of Justice Case C-317/04 {#european_court_of_justice_case_c_31704}

One of the questions in this case is whether assent European Parliament
was needed, instead of just advice, art 300 EU Treaty. The question was
not answered by the court: \"Consequently, Decision 2004/496 cannot have
been validly adopted on the basis of Article 95 EC. That decision must
therefore be annulled and it is not necessary to consider the other
pleas relied upon by the Parliament.\" We do have the opinion of the
advocate general.

## OPINION OF ADVOCATE GENERAL {#opinion_of_advocate_general}

LÉGER

delivered on 22 November 2005 1(1)

\"infringement of the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) EC, because
Directive 95/46 was amended;\"

( & C-318/04)

Quotes from the text:

B  The plea alleging that the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) EC
was infringed because Directive 95/46 was amended

In the view of that institution, the agreement in question entails
amendment of Directive 95/46, which was adopted under the procedure
referred to in Article 251 EC.

164\. In the Parliaments opinion, the undertakings which the US
authorities agreed to implement under the agreement fall short of the
conditions for processing data laid down by Directive 95/46. The
agreement therefore has the effect of derogating from certain
fundamental principles in that directive and of rendering processing
operations which are not authorised by it lawful. In that sense, the
agreement amends Directive 95/46.

171\. The EDPS supports the claims of the Parliament in that, in his
view, the agreement affects Directive 95/46.

172\. By contrast, the Council, supported by the Commission, submits
that the agreement does not entail amendment of Directive 95/46. In
support of that view, it cites paragraph 8 of the agreement, according
to which the latter is not intended to derogate from or amend
legislation of the Parties.

### Assessment

178\. By way of derogation from that generally applicable procedure, the
second subparagraph of Article 300(3) EC requires the assent of the
Parliament in four circumstances, including, so far as is of interest in
this case, where the agreement entails amendment of an act adopted
under the procedure referred to in Article 251. It is a question of
guaranteeing the Parliaments ability, as co-legislator, to exercise
control over any amendment by an international agreement of an act
adopted by it.

180\. In assessing the merits of this plea, I would point out first and
foremost that little importance attaches, in my view, to the fact that
the agreement states, in paragraph 8, that it is not intended to
derogate from or amend legislation of the Parties. What is important
for the purpose of giving effect to the second subparagraph of Article
300(3) EC is to ascertain whether the international agreement entails
amendment of the internal Community act, that is to say, whether it has
the effect of amending that act, irrespective of the fact that that is
not its aim.

181\. That said, it seems that the Court has not yet ruled on the
meaning to be given to the relatively vague expression amendment of an
act adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 251. (79) Some
authors have raised the question here whether the term amendment means
an amendment conflicting with the provisions of the internal act or
whether any amendment, even one consistent with the provisions of the
internal act is sufficient to require compliance with the assent
procedure. (80)

183\. Generally speaking, I am of the opinion that, in order for there
to be amendment by an international agreement of an internal Community
act adopted under the codecision procedure, one of the conditions is
that the field of application of the agreement overlap with that of the
internal act. In that case, the internal act may be amended by the
international agreement, either if the agreement contains a provision
which conflicts with one of those of the internal act or because the
agreement adds to the content of the internal act, even when there is no
direct conflict.

184\. In the present case, I take the view that the agreement was not
capable of amending the content of Directive 95/46.
