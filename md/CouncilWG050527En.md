*Below you can find the official attachés (civil servants/diplomats)
report of the Council Working Party on Intellectual Property (Patents)\"
meeting of 27 May 2005, where they discussed the software patents
directive.*

Delegates of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and
Hungary actively promote the most uncompromising and crude pro-patent
views, some of them in gross violation of obligations toward their
national parliament. Spain and Austria follow the lead of the patent
extremists and show no support for patent-critical !MEPs from their
countries. UK showed a certain flexibility and refinement in promoting
its pro-patent agenda. Only Poland clearly supports the amendments that
are needed to exclude pure software from patentability. Italy seems
willing to follow Rocard on many amendments. Malta sometimes follows
more patent-critical delegations. Luxemburg supports interoperability.
Denmark largely abstains from the discussion due to \"sensitivity\" of
the issues.
