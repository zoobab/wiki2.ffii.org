------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The FFII has a lot of experience with the European decision making
process. It is from this angle that we approach the proposed Data
Retention directive and the way it is being shoved through Parliament.
Unfortunately, parallels with the software patents directive are easy to
draw. It is even worse in this case, as the Commission and Council are
pushing for a single reading deal after less than 3 months since the
initial Commission proposal.*

It is unfathomable how the European institutions, and the European
Parliament in particular, are supposed to properly assess the impact of
this directive in cooperation with various human and digital rights
associations.

We mention a number of issues below which clearly demonstrate that this
directive is by no means ready to be adopted.

## Misrepresentation of study conclusions {#misrepresentation_of_study_conclusions}

*\"Wie wat bewaart heeft wat\"*, or *\"He who retains something has
something\"* in English. This is the title of a study by the Dutch
Erasmus University on the usefulness of data retention for law
enforcement purposes (the first, and even only as far as we know,
European public research of its kind). As [noted by
EDRI](http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number3.13/retention "wikilink"), the
[Commission\'s
assertion](http://europa.eu.int/comm/justice_home/doc_centre/police/doc/sec_2005_1131_en.pdf "wikilink")
(page 4) that it confirms *\"the importance of traffic data for all
sorts of investigations\"* was thoroughly blasted in the Dutch
Parliament. Even the researchers who wrote it warn they can\'t qualify
the usefulness of these data as direct or indirect evidence, or the
representativeness of the sample of cases for law enforcement in
general.

In case of the software patents directive, the Commission drew similarly
unfounded conclusions from an \"impact assessment\" study which
consisted of polling UK-based !SMEs about their need for software
patents. The consensus among all 11 respondents was that they were not
interested in software patents, and did not want them. From these 11
responses, the Commission concluded that European !SMEs need to be
better informed about the advantages that software patents offer them.

## National parliaments disagree {#national_parliaments_disagree}

The Committee on Justice and Internal Affairs of the Dutch Senate is
currently debating with Dutch Minister of Justice Donner regarding the
Council framework proposal and the proposed Commission directive. In its
[letter of 1 november
2005](http://europapoort.eerstekamer.nl/9345000/1/j9vvgy6i0ydh7th/vg7slw5im1tl?key=vh58o73zgyqn "wikilink")
to the minister, it strongly criticised the various proposed measures,
the lack of supporting evidence regarding necessity and the existence of
various ways to circumvent the collection of data (making it largely
useless in their eyes).

Additionally, it also strongly attacked the conclusions of the KPMG
report which is cited by the Commission. Minister\'s Donner\'s [reply on
28 November
2005](http://europapoort.eerstekamer.nl/9345000/1/j9vvgy6i0ydh7th/vg7slw5im1tl?key=vh5zbqk8wcs3 "wikilink")
was clearly unconvincing, as the Committee once more [refused to approve
his
proposal](http://www.europapoort.nl/9345000/1f/j9vvgy6i0ydh7th/vgq8mlyezvzt "wikilink")
on 29 November 2005. It remains to be seen how the Dutch government will
behave in the Council, given its [ infamous track
record](NLParlpreti040830En "wikilink") in the software patents case.

## Responsible advisory EU body disagrees {#responsible_advisory_eu_body_disagrees}

The [European Data Protection
Supervisor](http://www.edps.eu.int/12_en_opinions.htm "wikilink") notes
in [his
opinion](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/c_298/c_29820051129en00010012.pdf "wikilink"),
among other things, that *\"The EDPS recognises the changes of
circumstances, but is as yet not convinced of the necessity of the
retention of traffic and location data for law enforcement purposes, as
established in the proposal.\"*. He cites a lack of studies showing the
need for data retention and notes concerns regarding respect for the
European Charter of Human Rights.

Similarly, the Economic and Social Committee [heavily
criticised](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2003:061:0154:0163:EN:PDF "wikilink")
the Commission proposal for the software patents directive due to lack
of impact assessment studies and because of the absence of a
demonstrable need for software patents.

## No consensus {#no_consensus}

On page 10 of its [\"extended impact
assessment\"](http://europa.eu.int/comm/justice_home/doc_centre/police/doc/sec_2005_1131_en.pdf "wikilink"),
the Commission notes *\"Although public consultation and debate on this
issue has been wide-spread, including discussions at the European
Parliament, no common solutions have emerged from this.\"*

The Commission\'s answer is apparently to write a text and try to push
it through the entire legislative procedure in three months. Forcing a
\"consensus\" this way by simply not allowing any time to form an
opinion about said text, nor to consider the impact of the legislative
proposal, is making a mockery out of the democratic process by which the
EU is supposed to be governed.

The software patents directive was not based on one or other consensus
either, but on the wishes of a few stakeholders with lots of influence.

## European Parliament has serious concerns {#european_parliament_has_serious_concerns}

The revised recital 18 of the [EP\'s LIBE
report](http://www.edri.org/docs/364679XM.pdf "wikilink") (LIBE, the
Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is the
responsible committee for this directive in the European Parliament)
reads

\|\| it is unclear whether this Directive does not go beyond what is
necessary and proportionate in order to achieve those objectives, as
also pointed out by the European Data Protection Supervisor. \|\|

Recital 19 notes

\| This Directive could better respect the fundamental rights and the
principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union \|

So we now have a Parliamentary committee proposing a directive which
states about itself that it is quite possibly going beyond what is
necessary and proportionate, and which also says that it could do better
in terms of respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights. At the very
least this indicates that this directive is not ready for
rubberstamping.

In case of the software patents directive, the attempt of the Commission
and Council to push through a text which did not answer at all to the
concerns raised by the EP is well known: the first ever rejection of a
directive in the second reading by the EP.

## Member state reservations {#member_state_reservations}

There is quite an impressive list of [reservations by member
states](http://www.statewatch.org/news/2005/dec/eu-coun-dat-ret-29-11-05-15101-ADD1.pdf "wikilink")
attached to the Council presidency\'s \"compromise proposal\". This is
extremely reminiscent to the software patents directive, which was
approved by the Council in first reading with reservations by Belgium,
Cyprus, Denmark, France, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands and Poland.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, it seems the Council and Commission have not given up on
their strategy on trying to push through Parliament whatever they like.
They misrepresent independent studies. They encourage Parliament to
disregard due diligence in the interest of some vague higher goal: the
Lisbon agenda in the software patents case, fighting terrorism in case
of data retention. Stakeholders don\'t get a proper chance to be heard,
or are plainly ignored.

Before the Commission took over the initiative, the Council was already
trying to get similar measures instated by means of a Council framework
decision. When using this legislative tool, the Council is not required
to ask the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor, but one
can wonder why they did not do so. If ever there was a matter for the
EDPS, this directive is it. But this is consistent with the Council\'s
past behaviour of commitment to keeping the legislation sausage machine
running smoothly. Their motto often seems to be \'Better Bad Legislation
than No Legislation\'.

What\'s even worse is that this is no isolated incident. We see similar
time pressure being exerted in case of the
[IPRED2](http://www.ipred.org/en "wikilink") directive, and a similar
contempt for the opinions of various stakeholder representatives. And in
both cases, terrorism is supposed to make Parliament swallow everything
the Commission and Council throw at them.

More than ever, we need a Parliament which can say a clear \"NO\" to
indiscriminate legislative spamming and pressure by the Commission and
Council. We need good directives, and a good directive means a proper
overview of the big picture (the relation between the various
\"terrorism\"-inspired directives thrown at various subcommittees of the
EP), proper impact assessment, time to consider concerns of civil
society and industry, and especially time for Parliament to form its own
opinion.
