The United Kingdom\'s patent matters are run nearly exclusively by the
UK Patent Office which has been a relentless promoter of software
patentability in Europe since the 1970s.

## Corrigenda

## Random Addenda {#random_addenda}

Since the law on both sides of the Atlantic has found it impossible to
legislate any meaningful difference between hardware and software then
this implies that the difference between the idea behind an invention
and the invention itelf has become immaterial. Therefore, in software,
technology and knowledge coincide; i.e. there is no meaningful
difference between \"software as such\" and its computer implementation.
The law does not know the difference between an invention and knowledge
because this difference has disappeared. This means that to patent
software is to patent knowledge.

Broadcasting this to cultural institutions or media would be a pertinent
tactic. As a general law of morality, the quickest way to change is
always the longest way around. Undermine the moral case for software
patents.
