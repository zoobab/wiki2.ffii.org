*10 March 2005 \-- The paper \"Software Patents: a closer look at the
European Commission\'s proposal\" by Maria Alessandra Rossi of the
Doctoral School of Law and Economics, University of Siena, argues that
the Commission\'s proposal for the software patents directive does not
increase legal certainty and that it lacks compelling economic arguments
to codify the European Patent Office\'s practice. Additionally, it notes
that the European Parliament\'s first reading text was a step in the
right direction.*

### About the Commission and EP texts {#about_the_commission_and_ep_texts}

-   The European Parliament reviewed the draft Directive on first
    reading on 24 September 2003, approving an amended version of the
    Commission\'s proposal that undoubtely made some steps in the
    direction of improving clarity in the definition of patentable
    subject matter in the field of computer-implemented inventions.

-   (about 18 May) The sudden switch in Germany\'s position was pivotal
    in allowing the reach of an agreement on a compromise document that
    rejected crucial amendments that Germany itself had proposed, and in
    particular a specification of the requirement of technical
    contribution according to which the use of natural forces to control
    physical effects beyond the digital representation of information is
    considered to belong to a field of technology, while the mere
    processing, handling and representation of information is not.

```{=html}

```
-   The agreement reached at the Council\'s 18 May meeting almost
    immediately showed signs of a breakdown.

```{=html}

```
-   (about the Commission proposal) In spite of the above-mentioned
    advantages, in this section we will argue that the answer to the
    question whether we should expect increased legal certainty to
    follow from the Proposal\'s approach to pursue the harmonization
    objective along the lines of EPO jurisprudence should be given in
    the negative.

```{=html}

```
-   (about the Commission proposal) The main problem with the approach
    taken by the Proposal is that it establishes a set of conditions for
    patentability whose only meaningful and consistent interpretation
    coincides with a significant extension of patentability, close to
    the situation corresponding to a deletion of art.52(2) and (3).

```{=html}

-   Alternatively, if the EPC is there to stay in its current form, an
    attempt to find criteria more stringent than those contained in the
    Commission\'s Proposal for a distinction between patentable and
    unpatentable subject matter should be pursued. This is the approach
    taken by Parliament in the amendments approved on first reading.

### About economic policy {#about_economic_policy}

-   However, it could be the case that !SMEs\' low propensity to patent
    depends on reasons different from a lack of information, given that
    it is currently low also in countries where software has long been
    patentable.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The only unquestionable conclusion is, perhaps, that there is a need
    for more economic analysis targeted specifically to the software
    sector in order to inform policy making.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Basing the rationale for policy intervention on an assessment of the
    ensuing benefits and costs to society seems a much more promising
    avenue to take than relying on inherently uncertain distinctions
    based on semantics. After all, it should not be forgotten that the
    primary rationale for the very existence of the patent system is the
    objective of increasing innovation, so that decisions concerning its
    modifications should be taken on the basis of an assessment of the
    measures that would best serve this purpose, rather than by focusing
    exclusively on the internal consistency of the system as it has
    historically developed.

```{=html}

```
-   The second assumption is that, in considering changes to the status
    quo, the burden of proof should be on those proposing the changes.
    This implies that if, as argued in the previous section, the
    Proposed Directive is likely to result in a significant extension of
    patent protection granted to computer programs, we think the
    Commission should provide a much more compelling economic
    justification for its Proposal.

-   \... only the results of a study conducted by the London
    Intellectual Property Institute (which is by no means an economic
    think-tank) on behalf of the Commission are expressly mentioned \...

-   All of the empirical studies we are aware of reveal that firms in
    the software industry, and especially !SMEs, tend to rely
    predominantly on means other than patents in order to protect their
    innovations

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   It is certainly true that patent holders\' initiatives such as
    patent pools and cross-licensing may reduce the adverse consequences
    of patent-related transactional difficulties, but the question
    remains as to whether the overall benefits of software patents
    outweigh their costs, including the costs of devising these private
    solutions.

```{=html}

```
-   First, there is the question of the high number of trivial software
    patents patent offices routinely grant. This does not seem to be
    only an administrative problem requiring an increase in funding for
    prior art searches.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Second, the risk of inadvertent infringement is particularly high in
    the software field.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Having said this, it should be noted that it might be particularly
    difficult to practically implement a high non-obviousness (inventive
    step) threshold in software, because of the difficulty of defining
    the very meaning of inventiveness in the software field

        engineering could constitute patent infringement

### Conclusions

-   If, on the contrary, the Directive chose to adhere to EPO
    jurisprudence as a basis for harmonization, as the Proposal
    submitted by the Commission does, it is doubtful that it would be
    able to serve well either the purpose of increasing legal certainty
    or the objective of promoting innovation.

```{=html}

```
-   As for the objective of increasing innovation in the software
    sector, our negative conclusion on the ability of the Commission\'s
    Proposal to achieve it comes from a survey of recent economic
    literature.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Indeed, the economic evidence surveyed in this paper suggests that
    software possesses some peculiar characteristics that deserve
    special attention in devising patent policy:
    -   -   \(a\) software presents some peculiar obstacles to the
            consummation of the traditional protection-for-disclosure
            bargain inherent in the functioning of the patent system
            !\[..\]
        -   \(b\) the characteristics of innovation in the software
            industry suggest that an \"inventive step\" requirement more
            stringent than in more traditional industrial fields should
            be applied !\[..\]
        -   \(c\) software-related patents should be narrowly construed

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Unfortunately, the Proposal currently submitted by the Commission
    does not take the chance of addressing these issues adequately.
