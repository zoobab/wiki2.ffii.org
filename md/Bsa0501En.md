In a new paper, the Business Software Alliance (BSA), a copyright
enforcement initiative financed mainly by Microsoft, raises concerns
about \"spiraling litigation costs over patenting rights\" which
\"threaten to stifle innovation\". BSA is particularly concerned about
small patent licensing companies that specialise on attacking large
companies.

## Outline

-   [BSA: \"Intellectual Property for the 21st
    Century\"](http://bsa.org/ceoinitiative/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=21193&hitboxdone=yes "wikilink")
-   BSA recommends only minor reforms of the US patent system. In
    principle, BSA wants software to be patentable in the US, in Europe
    and everywhere.
-   The paper is part of a \"CEO Initiative\", with other documents to
    follow.

\"The BSA also proposed changes to U.S. patent law. The technology
industry is facing spiraling litigation costs over patent rights, which
the BSA said threatens to stifle innovation.

One problem is that as patents have proliferated, a new kind of business
has emerged in which companies seek to enforce patents solely to make
money, not to use the technology. Even when the patents are not likely
to stand up in court, companies often settle with the patent owners
rather than go through costly legal battles.\"
