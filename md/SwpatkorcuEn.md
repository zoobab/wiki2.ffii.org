So far computer-implemented solutions (computer programs) are not
*patentable inventions* according to European law. This doesn\'t mean
that a patentable manufacturing process may not be controlled by
software. However the European Patent Office and some national courts
have gradually blurred the formerly sharp boundaries.

-   [Stefan Schohe 1999: The Present Status of Software Protection in
    Europe and
    Germany](http://www.law.washington.edu/casrip/newsletter/Vol6/newsv6i2Schohe.html "wikilink")
    \-- a fairly lucid account by a patent attorney of the changes that
    led to the call for EPC revision and for a EU directive.
