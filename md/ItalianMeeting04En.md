Law](http://www.vrijschrift.nl/Members/awessels/digital-era-paradise-law.pdf "wikilink")
\"In 1256, Bologna adopted the Paradise Law, it abolished slavery. It
was the first city in the world to do this. The world needs another
Paradise Law now, software patents need to be abolished. And there is no
better place to talk about this, than Bologna.\" From Ante Wessels\'
Bologna speech.

-   The announcement:

Cremona room at the Department of Mathematics 4th and 5th floor. Piazza
di Porta San Donato 5 Bologna

From emails by prof Renzo Davoli:

\"I am waiting for final confirmation. We should have the following
people (I hope to forget noone): dr. Vittorio Prodi MEP, former
president of the Bologna Province Administration (confirmation pending,
I have had a personal phone call, He is shifting another appointment to
join our seminar. He seems to be very concerned with the topic). dr.
Domenico Zucchetti, Zucchetti s.p.a. owner (maybe he will be busy but
somebody from zucchetti will join the seminar). Alessandro Rubini
(fsfe-i) will join the conference on the internet stream (I will be his
voice - as a loudspeaker \"chat\" connected). Antonella Beccaria, member
of linux.it and Tech Journalist. Pietro Suffritti, ing. Davide Dozza,
Dr. Dario Rigolin computer professionals dr. Pierluigi Perri Lawyer.   I
am contacting others. The idea is to bring a position from many
perspectives (large and small software houses, professionals, lawyers
and university - me).\"

Ante Wessels from the Dutch
[Vrijschrift](http://www.vrijschrift.nl/softwarepatenten/ "wikilink")
foundation will come too.

It has about 240 seats, overhead projector, amplifier and network. There
will be a stream.

Co-sponsors of the seminar are: - FFII. - Department of Computer
Science - University of Bologna - Master in Free and Open Source

Bologna.

And for those that do not make it to Italy :-)

\"it is www.cs.unibo.it/\~renzo/live There is a Webcam, audio streaming
via icecast/ogg-vorbis, synchronized html slides (a live UNIX terminal,
but this is not needed I think).\"

You may like to join the it-parl list. (www.ffii.org -\> what to do) or
the bxl list (Brussels lobby).

Friday there will be a press conference in the morning in Milano, with
Eva Lichtenberger, member of the European Parliament and Fiorello
Cortiana, member of the Italian Senate. Both very concerned about the
topic. They hope to reinforce the Italian position.

Have a nice day!
