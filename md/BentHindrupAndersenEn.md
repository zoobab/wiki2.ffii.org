-   EDD lost most of its mandates in 2004, including that of Hindrup
    Andersen (the campaign didn\'t seem well organised)

Bent Hindrup Andersen, member of the European Parliament for the EDD /
June Movement group, was one of the most active !MEPs in opposing the
Commission\'s plans for patentability of \"computer-implemented\"
algorithms and business methods and had the support of his group for
this.
