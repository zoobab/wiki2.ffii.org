reported as much as anyone so far was able to find out about the
Commission\'s planned provisions on Microsoft\'s use of patents. Sources
at the Commission were not willing to reveal more details as of
2004/03/23.

As reported by [Pressetext
Austria](http://www.pressetext.at/ "wikilink") - a commercial Austrian
news service - in <http://www.pressetext.at/pte.mc?pte=040224011> (in
German language) the member of the European Comission Frits Bolkestein
intervenes one more time in support of Microsoft to lower the pending
fine for abusing the monopoly (as admitted by Microsoft itself) on the
operating system on desktop computers.

The key aims of the intervention - according to the message - are to
avoid a \"too drastic fine\" meaning the amount of money and devaluation
of \"intellectual property\" of Microsoft. Further, according to
Bolkestein, the verdict sould not force Microsoft to change its policies
and methods which are applied against its competitors.
