# \"Autumn\" camp Markelo, The Netherlands (Sept 17-20, 2004) {#autumn_camp_markelo_the_netherlands_sept_17_20_2004}

What makes 17 Sept so different to justify an exclusion from autumn?
(Autumn starts 23 Sept)\"):

In the weekend of 17-20 september 2004, there will be a FFII/Vrijschrift
autumn camp in Markelo, which will be held in the farmhouse next to
[Kop\'ren Smorre](http://koprensmorre.nl "wikilink"). It\'s for
supporters who want to learn more about software patent advocacy.

There\'s a room in the farmhouse that will be used for workshops, etc by
about 30-50 people. The restaurant next door also contains some rooms,
that might be useful. And it will be handy for food, etc.

In the farmhouse, there is an \@home broadband internet connection (4
Mbit down, 512k up) and I will make sure there is a 10 mbit hub and wifi
access point there. That\'s about it. Please bring your own wiring and
further equipment.
