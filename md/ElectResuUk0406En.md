Conservative party \'expert\' on software patents, [ Malcolm
Harbour](SwpatmharbourEn "wikilink"), had a particularly close call,
only just holding off UKIP to win the last seat in the West Midlands
region \-- UKIP polled 251,000 but needed 11,000 more to win a second
seat.

-   3 of the 4 Tory !MEPs who voted against swpat (Villiers, Purvis,
    Callanan) return to the new Parliament. Corbett, Labour\'s lone
    dissenter, is also back.
-   [ [LibDems](LibDems "wikilink")](/?ElectUkLib0405En "wikilink") gain
    2 new !MEPs. Nick Clegg, the lone dissenter on IPRED, did not stand
    again. Party thus loses its best hope of moving its !MEPs towards
    FFII-friendly positions.
-   SNP hold onto 2 !MEPs but !McCormick does not return (retired).
    Plaid Cymru retain one seat despite heavy loss of vote and shrinking
    of Welsh region by one !MEP. Greens retain 2 seats.
-   Big gains for UKIP.
