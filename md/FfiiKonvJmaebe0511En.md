## About me {#about_me}

I have written a short [ \"FFII CV\"](FfiiKonvJmaebeCv0511En "wikilink")
giving an overview of the things I have done in the FFII during the past
years. In daily life I am a computer scientist working on my !PhD (on
\"intelligent instrumentation of computer programs\").

## Why

Because I thought the FFII needed a new structure and new kind of
leadership, which it now has (and it\'s not me, which is even better)!
