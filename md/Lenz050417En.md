*17 April 2005 \-- FFII has received permission from Dr. Karl Friedrich
Lenz, Professor of European Law in Tokyo University, to publish a
version of his legal analysis of the European Patent Convention, Article
52, in translation. The EPC is the treaty that governs the European
Patent Office (EPO) and it is the reinterpretation of EPC 52 within EPO
institutions which has led to its current practice of patenting
software. Lenz reaches the conclusion that the Technical Boards of
Appeal of the European Patent Office have for some time now regularly
granted patents on computer programs as such and are showing a
disturbing willingness to substitute their own value judgements for
those of the lawmaker.*

        announced improved versions of the documentation on the [Vicom
        1986](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/epo-t840208/) and
        [IBM/Computer
        program](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/epo-t971173/) case
        decisions which are important milestones of the EPO\'s
        progressive circumvention of the written law.

## Why Lenz\'s paper matters {#why_lenzs_paper_matters}

The main merit of the Lenz paper lies in the analysis of the phrase
\"software as such\", derived from EPC 52(3), which carries a certain
interpretation of the EPC along. According to Lenz\' analysis the
interpretation of the EPO\'s Technical Board of Appeal was a
misinterpretation which cannot be derived using the common methods of
legal interpretation from EPC 52.

In the current political debate the phrase \"software as such\" is often
quoted without knowledge of its original context. The recent [Council
proposal](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ "wikilink")
even has a magical Bolkestein insert which says \"software as such\"
shall not be patentable.

` Article 4.1 A computer program as such cannot constitute a`\
` patentable invention.`

It shifts the meaning of the written law\'s \"programs for computers
\... as such\" to unexecuted source, object code or an instance of a
program which no one ever intended to patent. Terminology in the
software patent debate is often very vague and complicated. Nobody can
really explain what the difference of \"software\" and \"software as
such\" actually is. Hartmut Pilch explains why: \"This is a bit like
taking the *it* in *it is raining* out of context and asking what
mysterious entity this *it* is that is raining there.\"

According to Lenz the Technical Board of Appeal in its [IBM/Computer
program](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/epo-t971173/ "wikilink") decision
were wrong in ruling that there are two classes \"software\" and
\"software as such\" in the European Patent Convention. Moreover Lenz
rejects the teaching as unfounded that \"as such\" has to be understood
in the sense that computer programs as such are computer programs
without a technical character. In his conclusion, Lenz criticises the
decisions of the Technical Board of Appeal as exceeding its competences
and changeing the meaning of law by its interpretation, in effect
exceeding the scope of the written law. As Professor Lenz puts it:

` However the assertion that the limitation of the exclusion of software`\
` from patentability to software as such in paragraph 3 served the`\
` purpose of promoting technical progress by acknowledging patentability`\
` in the light of new developments in information technology is not`\
` convincing. If the legislator had intended such a purpose, he would`\
` not have introduced the exclusion in paragraph 2 in the first`\
` place. The assumption of a legal purpose that matches the desired`\
` result is not a correct use of the method of interpretation from`\
` purpose, but it does clearly demonstrate the willingness of the`\
` Technical Boards of Appeal to substitute their own opinions for those`\
` of the legislator.`

Lenz\'s observation are shared by many writers of legal analyses,
including as Reiman PA Reimar König, editor in chief of the German
patent attorney magazine Mitteilungen für Patentanwälte, who
[criticised](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/grur-koenig01/ "wikilink")
that the EPO decisions \"do violence to the law\". Klaus W. Melullis,
presiding judge of the patent senate of the German Federal Court of
Justice approvingly quotes Lenz\'s analysis in an [article of
2002](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/mellulis02/ "wikilink") which reaches
similar conclusions.
