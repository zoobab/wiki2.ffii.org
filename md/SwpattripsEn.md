    Prof. Bhagwati strongly critizised the misuse of the WTO framework
    by the IPP Lobby: \"IPP is not a \'trade\' issue; and the WTO ought
    to be aboutlowering trade barriers and tackling market access
    problems that will often go beyond border measures to \'internal\'
    regulations: a thorny issue. [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") is by
    contrast only about royalty collection. It was put into the WTO by
    considerable lobbying pressure in the United States in particular,
    so as to make the use of trade sanctions against user countries who
    used knowledge without paying royalty. It turned the WTO therefore
    into a royalty-collection agency!\"
-   19xx-xx-xx EU vs Canada WTO litigation case: Canada used to allow
    pharmaceutics manufacturers to **prepare** start of sales before
    expiry of the patent, so that sales could be launched the day after
    expiry of the patent. EU argued before WTO panel that Canada\'s
    practise was contrary to !TRIPs, pushed for narrow interpretation of
    exemption clauses, and won.
