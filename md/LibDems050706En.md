[MEPS EXPECTED TO REJECT COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED INVENTIONS -
WALLIS](http://www.dianawallismep.org.uk/news/266.html "wikilink")

6th July 2005

Commenting on the expected rejection of plans for a controversial
directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions,
Liberal Democrat spokesperson Diana Wallis MEP said:

\"It\'s disappointing not have been able to legislate to bring legal
certainty to this area, however, the likely outcome of the current
debate, could have left us with something even more unworkable.

\"Of course to some degree Software Patents is something of a sideshow
and the larger goal remains to get a \'Community patent\'. If committed
to the Lisbon Agenda then a \'Community patent\' would set Europe on the
right path to achieving it\'s economic goals.\"

Notes:

The European parliament will vote on the directive, on harmonising the
patentability of computer-driven inventions today - Wednesday 6 July.
Recommendation for second reading: Michel Rocard (A6-0207/2005) -
Patentability of computer-implemented inventions

The aim of creating a Community patent is to give inventors the option
of obtaining a single patent which is legally valid throughout the
European Union. The expected advantages of this system are:

-   a substantial reduction in patenting costs, particularly those
    relating to translation and filing;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   simplified protection of inventions throughout the territory of the
    EU thanks to a single procedure;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   the establishment of a single centralised system of litigation.

The creation of a Community patent system remains a sensitive issue as
this dossier is still deadlocked after 13 years of discussions by
European decision-makers.

### Andrew Duff {#andrew_duff}

[Duff calls for overhaul of EU patents in wake of EU software
crisis](http://www.andrewduffmep.org.uk/news/165.html "wikilink")

Following the defeat of the Computer-Implemented Inventions Directive in
the Parliament today, Liberal Democrat Euro-MP Andrew DUFF has warned of
the dangers of inaction. Mr DUFF, who played a leading part in the
mounting of Parliament\'s opposition to the draft law, made the
following statement:

\"We can be satisfied though not complacent at the outcome of this
legislative battle. It is good that a bad piece of draft law is now
dead, but the Parliament\'s rejection of the Council\'s draft law at
second reading should only be welcomed if action is now taken to sort
out the mess that surrounds the question of patents in the European
Union.

\"At present the single market suffers from 25 different national patent
systems which is costly and long-winded for firms and inventors. EU
harmonisation of patent law is needed so that enterprises can have a
one-stop shop and a single language for filing for patents across the
EU. The European Court of Justice needs to be able to develop its own
case law in patents.

\"In the light of the defeat of the sector-specific legislation, Mr
Barroso\'s Commission must take action and give impetus to the general
\'Community Patents Directive\'.

\"With respect to the computer industry, our aim throughout was to stop
the spread of patentability to pure software. A majority of
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") realised the danger that the proposed CII
Directive risked stifling innovation and adding substantially to the
costs of software development. Less innovation would mean higher prices
for consumers, and a defeat for Europe\'s global competitivity.\"

Mr DUFF represents the East of England which enjoys Europe\'s largest
cluster of the software industry. He added:

\"The drafting of the law we were invited to pass was shoddy. There was
a real danger that it could have opened the door to a further spread of
patents towards computer programs. While software code can be protected
by copyright in any case, it is important that the spread of patents
does not impede the growth of open source development or the
interoperability of systems. What Europe needs is a clear, consistent
regulatory framework with enforceable remedies. The patent regime must
exclude software as such, algorithms and business methods while allowing
patents for genuine inventions with commercial application.

\"Unless we get more legal clarity and consistency, European
patentability will continue to be governed by a muddle of different
national laws, some trivial patenting by the (non-EU) European Patents
Office, and by decisions of the WTO under the 1994
[TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") agreement.

\"I am happy to have worked with the Parliament\'s rapporteur Michel
Rocard (Socialist), Jerzy Buzek (European People\'s Party) and others to
have halted this potentially damaging piece of legislation.

\"I am only sorry that although we had a simple majority of
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") on our side, we had not achieved the absolute
majority (367 votes) that is needed to amend the draft law at second
reading. It was clear that the quality of the CII Directive could only
have been improved through substantive negotiations between Council,
Commission and Parliament in the formal conciliation process that would
have preceded the third reading. In the end there was a lack of
political will to carry on the fight. Parliament\'s withdrawal of
support for this Bill in these circumstances does not mean that the
problems the legislation was first introduced to address have gone away.

\"Lastly, I must commend the vigorous and intelligent lobbying that has
been brought to bear on [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") from both sides of the
divided industry. Without effective lobbying the real and serious issues
involved in this legislation would never have been exposed. It has been
impossible to please everyone - but certainly the interests of
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") have been assisted by the Parliament\'s
rearguard action. The effort must however continue to ensure that
US-style patent laws do not spread by infection into the European single
market.\"

### Sharon Bowles {#sharon_bowles}

[EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT LOOKS SET TO GIVE \'SOFTWARE PATENTS\' DIRECTIVE
THE CHOP!](http://www.sharonbowles.org.uk/news/9.html "wikilink")

The European Parliament today is expected to send the Commission and the
Council a strong message that it will not be rushed into supporting a
directive that it isn\'t happy with. Sharon Bowles, Liberal Democrat MEP
and a European Patent Attorney said \"I would be happy with a decision
to reject the directive. As I\'ve always said it better to have no
directive than to have a bad directive\".

\"The speculation and interest surrounding this directive has been
immense. It is unfortunate that a directive which sought to harmonise
the status quo across the EU was so mis-presented\".

Many Members were attracted into supporting Rocard\'s Amendments due to
an enormous lobby from software writers who thought that the directive
was bringing in US style software patents. Although the amendments have
some attractive elements they were not drafted tightly enough to relate
only to computer software and had large impact on electronics.

Yesterday during the plenary debate Sharon Bowles said to Mr Rocard (the
rapporteur) \"If you wished to construct a series of amendments to
cripple and disperse Europe\'s industry - large and small - you could
not devise anything more mischievous\".

Today Mrs Bowles said \"It has proven impossible to find amendments that
gave the software writers the security they wanted that did not cause
collateral damage to industry. The lack of legal clarity in the report
risked creating a gold mine for patent lawyers and a nightmare for
businesses.\"

The Parliament does not want to bin this forever, it wants the
Commission to bring this back after there have been proper impact
assessments.

London Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford is not among
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") rejecting proposed directive on patentability of
\'computer-related inventions\'. She said:

\"Rejection only prolongs the uncertainty around patentability of
software-related inventions in the EU. It is running away from the need
to take a decision.\"

\"I deeply regret that [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") are proving incapable of
coming up with a sensible version of the text, one which could ensure
support for innovation but also reassure software writers and users that
we were not going down an American-style route of allowing patents for
pure software.\"

\"MEPs are not covering themselves in glory. This process has displayed
all the defects in the way we legislate at EU level, which must be
addressed if we are to avoid portraying ourselves as incapable of
legislating on complex but vital subjects:

First, secrecy in the Council of Ministers: it is impossible to be
well-informed on the reasoning behind the Council\'s common positions.

Second, obstacles to understanding: it is hugely difficult to track on
the Council\'s website the chronological development of the legislation
even if documents are theoretically available.

Third, the wrong choice of European Parliament rapporteur: the
convention that a report is the property of a group and it is \'not
done\' to query their allocation to a particular member must be junked.

Fourthly, the stupidity of using a misleading shorthand description: in
this case shortening the long title of a Directive (Computer-Implemented
Inventions) to \'software patents\' was understandable but disastrous.
While it is laudable to try to simplify technical terms, we managed
stupidly to signal, quite wrongly, that there was an intention to patent
pure software as in the US.

Fifthly, the absence of parliamentary draughtsmen to advise
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"): we need Westminster-style advisers who can give
guidance on the precise meaning of terminology.

Notes:

The European Parliament voted today to reject the Common Position of the
Council on the Directive on Patentability of Computer-Implemented
Inventions by 648 votes to 14, with 18 abstentions.

### Graham Watson {#graham_watson}

[Time for a comprehensive European
Patent](http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/122.html "wikilink")

The European Parliament rejected the Council Common Position on Computer
Implemented Inventions today by a massive majority of 648 to 14 with 18
abstentions. It is the first time a piece of draft legislation has been
rejected by Parliament in second reading.

Graham Watson MEP (UK, Lib Dem), leader of the Alliance of Liberals and
Democrats (the largest of the groups which tabled an amendment to
reject), called for the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a
Single European Patent regime covering all sectors:

\"The Commission\'s proposal was unclear, Council\'s Common Position
remained ambiguous and Parliament was faced with a barrage of technical
amendments pulling in all directions. The chances of achieving legal
clarity and improving on the status quo were remote.\" Insisted Watson

\"Rejection of legislation is never ideal but Parliament has shown that
it has the ability to pull the plug on inadequate legislation.\"

\"It is now time to put an end to the squabbling in Council as there is
a pressing need for a Community patent regime that will bring the work
of the European Patent Office under democratic scrutiny and reduce the
costs and burdens on business in registering inventions.\"
