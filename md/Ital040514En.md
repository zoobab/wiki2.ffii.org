# 2004-05-14 Italy\'s Minister for Innovation and Technology against Council Proposal {#italys_minister_for_innovation_and_technology_against_council_proposal}

[Italy\'s Minister for Innovation and Technology, Lucio
Stanca](http://www.mnii.gov.pl/mnii/index.jsp?place=Lead08&news_cat_id=30&news_id=432&layout=2 "wikilink"),
sent a
[letter](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/stanca0405/ "wikilink")
to the ministers in charge of dealing with patents, Rocco Buttiglione
(EU affairs), Antonio Marzano (industry) and Letizia Moratti (education
& research). Stanca asks to propose the Directive as proposed by the
Council and support the amendments of the European Parliament as well as
of the other delegations, in particular those for interoperability and
more strict definitions of \"technical\", explaining that software as
such should not be patentable, that 30000 questionable patents have been
granted by the EPO and that strict definitions are needed to avoid such
patents.

Stanca is not directly involved in the Council meetings but formulates a
position in the name of the Italian government. It is to be seen to what
extent Buttiglione (minister for EU affairs ans recipient of the [5 CEO
FUD letter of
2003/11/07](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/telcos1107/ "wikilink")),
Marzano (minister for political activities) and Moratti (minister for
University and Research) will accept Stanca\'s position and pursue it in
the council.
