## What is this {#what_is_this}

-   as announced in <http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en&f=netstrike> and
    elsewhere
-   packaging/naming somewhat different from previous \"netstrikes\",
    rely more on banners

## To do {#to_do}

-   find project leader
-   create short strike pages
    -   -   one appetite-whetting message
        -   on importance of Europarl for EU democracy, rather than just
            on swpat
-   create election banners
    -   -   possibly with logos of good parties
-   improve [ election pages](Elect0405En "wikilink")
    -   -   provide a usable instruction (e.g. \"in case of doubt
            green\") to the impatient
        -   ask national helpdesks to create proper national pages
