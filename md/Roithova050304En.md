*4 March 2005 \-- In a public statement, Dr. Zuzana Roithova, member of
the European Parliament for the European People\'s Party and
vice-chairwoman of Parliament\'s Committee for the Internal Market and
Consumer Protection, strongly criticises the attempts of the Commission
and Council to adopt the zombie software patent agreement of May 2004
without a qualified majority and calls on the Czech government to
support moves for reopening of negotiations.*

Roithova announced today the Council informed her that the directive
will be approved as an A-item on Monday, and all the three request for
restart from European Parliament will be ignored.

Roithova requested more information from the Czech government about
their position, and received a reply stating that the Czech minister
will vote in favour on Monday. Consequently, she publicly announced that
that she requests that the Czech goverment:

-   Requests a B-item in the Council
-   votes NO in case that there will be vote on Monday
-   should support the restart and should be working on a constructive
    text, made with respect to public

She said:

`"I believe that common sense will win, because the Council can otherwise`\
` only expect a vote against the whole directive from most of the `[`MEPs`](MEPs "wikilink")`"`
