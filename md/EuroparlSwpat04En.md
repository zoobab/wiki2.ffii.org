------------------------------------------------------------------------

In May 2004 the EU Council of Ministers kicked the European Software
Patent Directive back to stage 0 or -1 by ignoring all the changes of
the European Parliament and introducing new elements such as program
claims that widen the cleavage even further. Some people in the European
Parliament have proposed that the Parliament should under such
circumstances not go into a 2nd reading. A 2nd reading would expose a
new Parliament with 10 new member states to difficult decisions, taken
in short time with heightened majority requirements (absence counts in
favor of the Council) under the impression of an unprecedented lobbying
blitz, and then send them into backroom conciliation procedures with a
Council that has not even faced the problems yet.

## News & Chronology {#news_chronology}

-   2005-01-25 [ UNICE](SwpatuniceEn "wikilink") member associations ask
    their members to lobby against restart, arguing that Council
    position is good for them and EP will have difficulty in getting the
    required high majorities to seriously amend it in 2nd reading
-   2005-01-19 [ Commission attempts to thwart EP attempt for
    restart](Juri050119En "wikilink") but fails due to Polish

    [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink")](Restart0501En "wikilink"), rejected by EP
    tabling office in defiance of rule 55(4) and without an explanation
    (tabling office policy seems to be to strengthen the party groups)
-   2004-04-14 [ Olga Zrihen](OlgaZrihenEn "wikilink") calls for another
    1st reading of the directive (in an interview with EU Reporter)

## Arguments for 1st Reading {#arguments_for_1st_reading}

[ Olga Zrihen](OlgaZrihenEn "wikilink") has called for another 1st
reading of the directive (in an interview with EU Reporter on
2004-04-14).

The main arguments for this are

-   Council\'s work doesn\'t build on work of last parliament\'s
    plenary, is in substance like a new first draft
-   New parliament needs to make up its mind anew, doesn\'t necessarily
    want to build on last parliament\'s reading
-   2nd reading implies limitations, e.g.
    -   -   amendments are limited to what was submitted by last
            parliament or compromises with council
        -   everything must be done in 4 months, no opportunity for much
            discussion
        -   votes of absent [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") are counted as
            pro-council
-   [EP rules on
    readings](http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040501+RULE-071+DOC+XML+V0//EN&HNAV=Y "wikilink")
    say that another first reading would be appropriate \"where new
    elections to Parliament have taken place since it adopted its
    position, and the Conference of Presidents considers it desirable.\"
-   new Parliament is very different from old one, 10 new member states
    have not had a chance at 1st reading

## Rule 55 {#rule_55}

[Rule 55 Renewed referral to
Parliament](http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-055+DOC+XML+V0//EN&HNAV=Y "wikilink")

1\. The President shall, at the request of the committee responsible,
ask the Commission to refer its proposal again to Parliament

-   where the Commission withdraws its initial proposal after Parliament
    has adopted its position in order to replace it with another text,
    except where this is done in order to incorporate Parliament\'s
    amendments; or
-   where the Commission substantially amends or intends to amend its
    initial proposal, except where this is done in order to incorporate
    Parliament\'s amendments; or
-   where, through the passage of time or changes in circumstances, the
    nature of the problem with which the proposal is concerned
    substantially changes; or
-   where new elections to Parliament have taken place since it adopted
    its position, and the Conference of Presidents considers it
    desirable.
