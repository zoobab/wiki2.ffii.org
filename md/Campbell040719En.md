Gary Campbell, an executive of HP, upon conclusion of a patent
cross-licensing agreement with Microsoft, writes that attacks of
Microsoft on free software are to be expected soon and proposes a set of
measures to be taken by HP, including some degree of disengagement from
opensource software.

This \"Campbell memo\" surfaced this weekend, but it is already two
years old. Microsoft has meanwhile been engaging in a patent-application
frenzy together with buildup of a patent licensing program. Attack on
free software have still not been carried out on the massive scale
anticipated by the Campbell memo.

Commentators write that the attacks may have been put off because MS is
in the middle of building up a \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\"
licensing program and waiting for acceptance of this program by
antitrust authorities and for the EU to rubberstamp the European Patent
Office\'s practise by the means of its software patent directive.
