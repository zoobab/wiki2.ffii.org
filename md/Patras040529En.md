## Workshop in Patras, Greece, 29-30 May 2004. {#workshop_in_patras_greece_29_30_may_2004.}

During the last two months, the Greek activist team, which had unluckily
been inactive for months, has been re-organizing. This, to a large
degree, was triggered by the FFII events of April and the Council
Meeting of May. Until now we have setup a wiki, made many translations,
assembled a to-do list, prepared lists of candidate
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") and other important Greek persons, and directly
helped FFII with several contributions. The increased activity has
brought more people to the team.

In 29 and 30 May 2004, a workshop will be held in Patra. About five
people are expected to be there. People from other cities of Greece who
are unable to come to Patra will participate via IRC. Discussion
highlights are expected to be, among others, creation of a roadmap,
improvement of the Greek web site, press relations, political relations,
and closer co-ordination with FFII.

Because of our geographical location, we don\'t expect any people from
other countries to participate; however, anyone happening to be passing
by is, of course, welcome and encouraged to contact us at
epatents\@lists.hellug.gr.
