------------------------------------------------------------------------

Campaign for Creativity was shrewd in its claim to represent artists,
musicians, designers, engineers and software developers trying to mimic
a [grassroots political
movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots "wikilink") while in
fact it was a a professional political campaign, set up to lobby Members
of the European Parliament (MEPs), which was engaged in
[astroturfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing "wikilink")
supported by software giants like Microsoft and SAP and was orchestrated
by Campbell Gentry, a London-based public affairs firm, of which Simon
Gentry, a public affairs consultant, was the leader of this campaign.

Gentrys pedigree was being a successful agent for corporate lobbys
with top quality. His previous associations include involvement in the
shameful industry campaign for patents on life on behalf of pharma giant
!SmithKline Beecham which succeeded in convincing leaders of a few
patient interest groups that patents on genes are a precondition for
cure and managed to fly some to Brussels, bring them in wheelchairs into
the European Parliament using and slogan \"No Patents, No Cure!\".
Later, the patient group leaders which have been used by Gentry\'s
campaign regretted their use in the campaign.

Tactics of the C4C have included giving out free ice creams to
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") while sending the invitation to it from the
office of pro-program-claim MEP Malcolm Harbour on a hot afternoon and
renting a sailing big motorized yacht, staffed with a huge banner saying
\"Vote for the CII directive\" in canal of Strasbourg like a modern
pirate, next to the European Parliament.

The English language website mentioned that the campaign is supported
by corporations including software multinationals Microsoft and SAP,
and industry association CompTIA. But to qustions from
[LobbyControl](LobbyControl "wikilink"), Gentry refused to disclose how
C4C is actually financed. He claimed that C4C has some hundred
individual supporters, but these do not contribute financially. The
companies, Gentry told [LobbyControl](LobbyControl "wikilink"),
contribute to specific actions of the campaign, not on a fixed scheme.
Lobbycontrol complained in a public statement that Gentry dismissed
their questions about finances as meaningless, arguing that the
campaign also benefits from resources provided (e.g. providing access to
rooms or help from a patent lawyer), not only money. The burning
question, who the Campaign for Creativity really represents, was not
answered.

C4C also failed to make reference that C4C co-ordinator Simon Gentry is
part of the public affairs firm Campbell Gentry. The German and French
language versions of the site did not even mention the support of
companies and CompTIA.

## Outline

Initially created as a campaign for strong enforcement of broad
\"intellectual property\" rights (probably created to lobby for the EUCD
which is the EU\'S counterpart to the DCMA and the intellectual propery
enforcement directive) it was attempting to find some people with
real-life stories around copyright.

One of them, [ Mandy Habermann](MandyHabermanEn "wikilink"), does not
fit in and she has even distanced herself from similar campaigns using
her as an example. The well known software patent protagonist and patent
agent [Axel
Pfeiffer](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/pfeiffer/ "wikilink") from
Munich appeared at the Strasburg Dinner of C4C in November 2004 as the
guest speaker.

The campaign site portrayed the opponents of software patentability as a
handful of ideologues who are trying to deprive creators of the
legitimate fruits of their work. It did not give a any name or web
reference to any of these ideologues, who must be extremely powerful,
since the site claims that the European Parliament voted for amendments
which \"destroy the incentive to create new software\" just to
\"appease\" this group.

C4C is a professionally designed web page, and it was likely that many
people actually believed it to be genuine. This site proved that the
lobbying is not always done in a honest manner and that this also
includes including actively and openly promoting misinformation.

The underlying back-office service was provided by a hired gun outfit
[Advocay
Online](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A//www.advocacyonline.net/ "wikilink")
which also works for a number of \"good cause\" charities, and as of
Summer 2006, <http://www.campaignforcreativity.org> redirects to the
start page of Campbell Gentry and <http://campaignforcreativity.org>
(without www) still shows the start page of Advocay online, like it did
while the campaign was active.

[Here](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A//www.adaptwestminster.co.uk/html/HoCDepts/MPexchange.htm "wikilink")
we see another product of the founder of advocacyonline, Mr. Graham
Covington. This is a portal where anyone can use a portal system to send
messages to an MP and the MP can log in to this sytem to read what
he/she has received.

There have been reports from politicians that they have been receiving
the mails generated by !C4C.

C4C never disclosed its supporters but [lobbycontrol.de
(german)](http://www.lobbycontrol.de/blog/index.php/2005/12/campaign-for-creativity-erhalt-worst-eu-lobbying-award/ "wikilink")
wrote that it has been supported by Microsoft, SAP as well as the
US-based international association CompTIA, which says that it is a
associaiton of computer professionals but it\'s political activities
show that it lobbies on the side of Microsoft, so a it can be assumed
that it at least in some part, dependent on Microsoft. The chief EU
Lobbyists of CompTIA ist Hugo Lüders, who regularily appeared at
Software Patent events, was often seen in the European Parliament and
was very vocal.

## EU Biopatent Directive Lobbying Success {#eu_biopatent_directive_lobbying_success}

About Simon Gentry, the registrant for this page, he lobbied for the
pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (SB) on the EU Life Patent
Directive issue:

<http://www.corporateeurope.org/observer1/patents.html>

` "`\
` The pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (SB) has been one of the `\
` most aggressive campaigners for the Directive, launching its own lobby `\
` campaign even before `[`EuropaBio`](EuropaBio "wikilink")` existed. According to SB lobbyist Simon `\
` Gentry, the company allocated 30 million ECU from the start for a `\
` pro-Directive campaign.`\
` "`

30 million ECU (Eur) for a pro-EU Life Patent Directive campaign from a
single company, what should be the budget for the pro-SWPAT campaign?

The biotech directive campaign eventually succeded by carrying lots of
handicapped persons in wheel-chairs into the European Parliament and
making them clamor for gene patents \"because otherwise the medicines
that save us will not be developed\".

It should be noted that thanks to Gentry\'s successful campaigning the
EU now has a directive which goes to such extremes in allowing gene
patenting that even some big genetics companies are unhappy about it and
some governments have tried to attack it at the European Court of
Justice or to delay its implementation.
