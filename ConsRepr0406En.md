### Poland (8 votes) {#poland_8_votes}

[ Poland](SwpatplEn "wikilink") was represented on the Council debate
and vote on this directive by minister Jarosl/aw Pietras, from the
Office of the Committee for European Integration. The body entiteld to
make the decision on this directive from the polish govrnement is the
Ministry of Scientific Research and Information Technology. That
ministry gave the instructions to vote against the directive in the
version presented by COREPER, and give support to amendments which where
to be introduced by Germany. All the time up until half an hour before
the vote on 18 may 2004, the German amendments where substantially
different from the ones that where introduced in the final vote.
Specifically they had the two very important sentences \"The use of
natural forces to control physical effects beyond the digital
representation of information belongs to a technical field. The mere
processing, handling, and presentation of information do not belong to a
technical field, even where technical devices are employed for such
purposes.\" Delegations, where like in the polish delegation not the
minister responsible for informatics, but another delgate is
participating in the vote, did not have any chances to make a good
decision, as they needed to consult appropieate ministries back in their
countries, and there was simply not enought time for that, as there was
less then half an hour between presenting the amendments and voting.
That was exactly the situation with the polish delegation: minister
Jarosl/aw Pietras called the ministry of scientific Research and
Information Technology in Poland, and asked for instructions about the
new amendments, but before any carefull legal analisys of the amendments
could take place, the vote was over in the Council. That is why the
representative of Poland did not make a vote after the break in the
Council - becasue he did not want to make a bad decision. This was
certainly not a sign of support for the directive.

### Hungary (5 votes) {#hungary_5_votes}

[ Hungarian](SwpathuEn "wikilink") representative Peter Gottfried made a
very ambigious speech in which he carefully did not give away his
mandate nor any opinions. No more trails can be found of the events,
except that he couldn\'t possibly have voted NO, despite every earlier
promises not to support software patents. There was confusion for a few
days back home after the session, and the IHM Ministry made a
clarification and justified their YES vote in a press-release. This
surprised many but noone was in position to do anything. The reversal is
on the agenda for a decision making body on the 28th of August 2004.

### Netherlands (5 votes) {#netherlands_5_votes}

Ministry misled the NL Parliament, claimed that nobody wanted software
patents and that for this an agreement between EP and Council had been
reached. Later the Parliament passed a motion asking the government to
withdraw its support from the Council proposal, see

### Denmark (3 votes) {#denmark_3_votes}
