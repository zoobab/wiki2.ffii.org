-   \"IP expert\" [Diana Wallis
    MEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Wallis "wikilink") voted
    with ELDR \"IP expert\" [ Toine Manders](ToineMandersEn "wikilink")
    -   -   But the \"professional IP expert\" of the Lib Dems/ELDR is [
            Sharon Bowles](SharonBowlesEn "wikilink")
-   [Andrew Duff MEP](http:AndrewDuffEn "wikilink") critical but
    insecure, afraid of \"destruction of IP assets\" etc, voted also
    with Diana Wallis (only rejected program claims, but not voted for
    any other limitations).
    -   -   Maybe also due to the partie\'s IP Lobbyist [ Patent
            Lobbyist Sharon Bowles](SharonBowlesEn "wikilink")

-   Versions of a standard letter from Elspeth Atwooll and Liz Lynne
    seem worryingly reassured by the new Council text

        -   [ Liz Lynne MEP letter](LtrLynne040608En "wikilink")

-   A [ longer variant from Sarah Ludford
    MEP](LtrLudford040608En "wikilink") seems more concerned. But she
    thinks that software patents should be available \"for new
    inventions only, rather than computer programs as such\" (?) \-- and
    again, apparently does not see through to the emptiness of the
    Council text.

```{=html}

-   A new, more personal [ letter from Elsepth Atwooll
    MEP](LtrAtwooll040609En "wikilink"), which does now appear to take
    much more on board the \'weakness\' of the Council text.

```{=html}

```
-   Both letters from Elsepth Atwooll are based on a [press release from
    Diana Wallis after the vote of September
    23](http://www.ffii.org.uk/players/people/meps/libdems/wallis.html "wikilink") -
    as you can see, the [critique to the new letter is the
    same](http://www.edlug.ed.ac.uk/archive/Jun2004/msg00213.html "wikilink"),
    but it\'s good to see some apparently personal comments at the end
    of this letter.

The Position of the national UK [LibDems](LibDems "wikilink") is defined
as follows from their policy paper 54: \"Making IT Work - Policies for
Information Technology\"

2.2.5 We do not believe that the citizen as consumer will be well served
if a wholesale failure in the copyright system leads to a drying up of
creativity as the financial incentives disappear. But we also recognize
that there are circumstances in which protection systems can have
thecontrary effect of stifling creativity against the public interest.
We are especially concerned about the use of patents in the area of
computer software in this respect.

2.2.6 There are usually many ways to achieve the same objective using
computer code. The public benefits from the fact that different teams of
programmers will work on solving problems and release their separate
solutions as competitors in the market.

The specific code each team has written is protected by copyright.

Allowing a wide definition of inventiveness for patents in the field of
software could lead to a reduction in this creative activity. This might
be justifiable if there were evidence that the software industry as a
whole were suffering because of an inability to secure revenue for
research and development but there is no evidence that this is the case
as the sector remains vibrant and growing.
