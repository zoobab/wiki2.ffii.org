*WIBU Systems AG, a German digital rights managment software company, is
being paraded as an example Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) that
need\'s the EU Council\'s text on software patentability in order to
secure the validity of a patent on its business model, the only one that
WIBU owns. Siemens and EICTA have identified this patent as relating to
a \"computer-implemented invention\" that \"makes a technical
contribution\", in the correct meaning of the term as used by the
European Patent Office and the Commission and Council. For once, they
are not lying about the Council\'s proposal.*

## News & Chronology {#news_chronology}

-   2005-04-07 [ DIHK event in Munich](Dihk050407De "wikilink"): [
    Siemens](SwpatsiemensEn "wikilink") patent attorney Kai Brandt
    allocates part of his speaking time to WIBU CEO and patent inventor
    Oliver Winzenried so as to more credibly argue the case that !SMEs
    need patents on \"computer-implemented inventions\" as allowed by
    the Council but not by the EP. In his speech, Winzenried explains
    that they own only one EPO patent, that this took more than 4 years
    to grant, that the process was expensive, and that other companies\'
    DRM patents are causing WIBU some trouble. However, Winzenried says
    that these experiences are not a sufficient reason to oppose
    software patentability, because business works like that in other
    fields as well.
-   2005-04-00 A patent propaganda film on a [ patent lobby
    website](Patents4InnovationEn "wikilink") shows WIBU as an SME that
    needs patents on \"computer-implemented inventions\" as authorised
    by the Council.

[ Hartmut Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink") comments: It should be noted
that the claims are directed neither to a new device nor to some new
mathematical magic but to a computer-implemented business model, whose
main features seems to be that licensing parameters are transmitted by a
key which is distinct from the key that is used for encoding and
decoding.

Siemens patent lawyer Kai Brandt has been [
touting](Dihk050407De "wikilink") this patent as an example of a
\"computer-implemented invention\" that \"makes a technical
contribution\" and would be [grantable only under the Council\'s paper
but not under that of the
Parliament](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ "wikilink").

### Main Claim as granted by EPO {#main_claim_as_granted_by_epo}

1\. Method of protecting computer software and/or computer-readable data
against unauthorised use, comprising the steps:

-   encoding of the software or data by the licensor as a function of
    licence parameters containing a User Code (UC) allocated by the
    licensor of the software or the data, which together initiate the
    encoding;
-   storage of the encoded software or data on a data carrier of the
    licensee;
-   encoded transmission of the licence parameters from the licensor to
    the licensee;
-   storage of the licence parameters in a non-volatile memory of the
    licensee;
-   automatic decoding of the software or data by means of a decoder as
    a function of the stored licence parameters during the use of the
    software or data by the licensee;

characterised in that

-   the encoding of the software or data is initialised as a function of
    a secret Firm Key (FK) freely selected by the licensor;
-   the encoding of the transmission of the licence parameters takes
    place as afunction of a secret Private Serial Key (SK);
-   the decoding of the software or data is initialised as a function of
    the Firm Key (FK) selected by the licensor.
