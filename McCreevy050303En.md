*3 March 2005 \-- The Commissioner for the Internal Market is coming to
the Conference of Presidents in the European Parliament at 11.00 to
represent the European Commission.*

The Presidents had invited Barroso, but Barroso had [
declined](Barroso050302En "wikilink").

On Monday Barroso had moreover [declined the Parliament\'s restart
request in writing without giving a
reason](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/barroso0502/ "wikilink"), but it is
[ known](Com050228En "wikilink") that the main reason is the
unwillingness of !McCreevy and the DG which he represents.

The EP\'s Legal Affairs Committee had already heard !McCreevy and voted
19:2 against his arguments. The purpose of today\'s meeting had been to
talk directly to Barroso, who is responsible for the rejection of the
Parliament\'s request and who should have coordinated a collegiate
decision involving all the directorates of the Commission, rather than
just transmitted the wish of the leading Commissioner.
