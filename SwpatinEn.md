*India\'s patent law states that computer programs per se are not
inventions in the sense of the law. Program claims are not allowed and
the patent office\'s [ examination
guidelines](SwpatRulesInEn "wikilink") seem to take the software
exclusion more seriously than in Europe. Multinational corporations are
currently hurrying to open R&D centers in India.*

## Synopsis

-   [Good analysis of the changed wording in the
    ordinance](http://wiki.ffii.org/Nath0412En "wikilink")
-   India\'s patent law states that computer programs are not invention
    in the sense of the law
-   Indian Patent law knows patentable inventions as opposed to
    non-patentable invention (\<\> non-inventions)
-   The patent office has been softening this, similar to the EPO, but
    there is more counter-pressure than elsewhere, partially due to the
    belief that patents are an arm of already-developed countries such
    as the US against developing countries such as India
-   Currently, [ program claims](EubsaProgEn "wikilink") are not
    permitted in India, and the [ US](SwpatusEn "wikilink") is exerting
    pressure to have them permitted.
    -   -   The newspaper articles to not give exact indications as to
            how high this issue is on the US patent lobby\'s agenda, but
            it is there without doubt. The purpose of the term \"program
            product\" is to trigger [
            [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink")](SwpattripsEn "wikilink").

\"NASSCOM\... is working with software vendors along with Business
Software Alliance (BSA) to implement stringent litigation and judiciary
to control software piracy:

    levels about copyrights, patents, trademarks and
