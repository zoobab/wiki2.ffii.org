------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Danish government has traditionally left patent matters almost
completely in the hands of the Danish Patent and Trademark Office
(DKPTO), which has been one of the most vigorous promoters of the patent
faith and of software patentability in Europe. However, as in other
countries, the DKPTO\'s control over the dossier has recently started to
become shaky.*

The government can\'t draw on its usual supporter, the EU skeptical
Danish People\'s Party (Dansk Folkeparti) in this matter, so draws
support from the main opposition party, the [Social
Democrats](http://wiki.ffii.org/DKSocialDemocrats "wikilink"). Right now
they are undecided, but check for
[updates](http://wiki.ffii.org/DKSocialDemocrats "wikilink").

On the Feb. 8 election the Christian Democrats lost all of their 4
seats. They are strong software patent opponents, and while their votes
were uninfluential this means the loss of a speaking platform against
unlimited patentability.

## Patent Movement in the Name of the Danish Government {#patent_movement_in_the_name_of_the_danish_government}

Their activities of the patent officials in the Danish Ministry of
Economics include

-   efforts to
    -   -   rush the CEC/BSA software patentability directive through
            the Council of the European Union (CEU) and to
        -   worsen it by introducing program claims
-   publishing \"expert opinions\" which claim that no innovation would
    happen without patents and that patents are beneficial even for the
    development of free/opensource software
-   placing the Danish EU Presidency of 2002 under the slogan \"Growth,
    Prosperity and Patents\"
-   lobbying for EU subsidies to a proposed insurance for patent owners
-   supporting the Council\'s [ political agreement of
    2004-05-18](Cons040518En "wikilink") while pretending to be
    \"unhappy\" about it \-- this was later negated publicly by the
    minister himself.

## Danish Patent Office stricter on Prior Art ? {#danish_patent_office_stricter_on_prior_art}

D. Martin explained at the [FFII Conference
2004](http://eu.ffii.org/sections/bxl0411/ "wikilink") that his company
is supplying prior art search services for the DKPTO which have enabled
them to reject many more patents than other patent offices. This in turn
has diminished the revenues of the DKPTO, because applicants now prefer
to go to the EPO instead.
