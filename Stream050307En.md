Thanks to the cooperation of several people, you will be able to follow
the Council debate live. To do so, download and install the
[VideoLan](http://www.videolan.org/ "wikilink") player for your platform
of choice, and connect to the following network address

[`http://apunkt.ffii.org:8000/live.ogg`](http://apunkt.ffii.org:8000/live.ogg)

You can also use a program which supports .m3u playlists such as !WinAmp
or XMMS (as long as it also supports the ogg vorbis audio codec), in
which case you can use this link:
