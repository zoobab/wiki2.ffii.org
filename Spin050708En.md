------------------------------------------------------------------------

*8th July 2005 \-- various patent lobby groups had invested many million
euro in order to press a pro-patent directive text from the Council
through the Parliament\'s second reading. Early this week they found
that this would not be possible and therefore asked \"their\"* !MEPs *to
go for rejection of the \"Common Position\". After some initial
statements of dismay, the patent lobby groups were however quick to
claim the Parliament\'s rejection vote as a victory. Some even interpret
it as a rejection of the 21 cross-partisan amendments. Such
reinterpretation of events is often referred to as \"spin-doctoring\".
The effort has to some extent been successful in influencing the
reporting of major media.*

A german PR distributed via presseportal.de goes further: \|\|
EU-Parlament weist alle Verbesserungsvorschläge der Patentgegner zurück
und lässt gemeinsame Richtlinie zur Patentierbarkeit von
Hightech-Innovationen in Europa fallen. \|\| \|\| EU Parliament rejects
all amendment proposals of the patent opponents and drops a common
directive on the patentability of hightech innovations in Europe. \|\|
\|\| Nach fünf Jahren der Beratung über die Patentierbarkeit von
Hightechinnovationen in Europa hat das Europäische Parlament alle von
den Patentgegnern der verschiedenen Fraktionen vorgelegten
Änderungsvorschläge mit überwältigender Mehrheit abgewiesen. \|\| \|\|
After five years of consultations about the patentability of hightech
innovations in Europe, the European Parliament has rejected all
amendments proposed by the patent opponents in the various groups with a
massive majority. \|\|

    \-- This article carries the spin of tory \"patent expert\" [
    Malcolm Harbour](SwpatmharbourEn "wikilink"), also [ used by Liberal
    patent expert Toine Manders](Manders050702En "wikilink"), which
    pretends that the [21 cross-partisan
    amendments](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/komprom0506.en.pdf "wikilink")
    would have created a mess. In fact nearly half of the tory
    [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") were planning not to follow Harbour but to
    vote for these 21 amendments. The Parliament had a certain majority
    for central amendments and high likelihood for many others. Under
    this impression the patent lobby (EICTA, BSA) is rumored to have
    held a crisis meeting with \"their\" !MEPs on monday evening, asking
    them to go for rejection, something which the others had demanded
    all along for other reasons.
