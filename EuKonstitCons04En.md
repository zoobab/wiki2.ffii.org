## Consiliar/Soviet Union of European Republics ? {#consiliarsoviet_union_of_european_republics}

The proposed constitution perpetuates the current undemocratic system of
the EU, wherein legislative power is wielded mainly by the Executive. It
cements the EU as a \"Union of Councils\", i.e. a consiliar (soviet)
union, with Council/Commission acting as \"politbureau\" where much of
the legislative process takes place in the dark without supervision by
any parliament.
