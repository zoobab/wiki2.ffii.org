*Friday, 13th, Campaign for Creativity launched a bizarre attack against
the FFII. The campaign reaches a new quality by choosing a new, very
undiplomatic tone. JURI-Rapporteur Michel Rocard (PSE) was slandered as
a \'handmaiden\' of FFII. Campaign for Creativity is a professional
campaign, which depicts itself as a grassroot campaign of creative
practioners. The PR-Professional show certain concern over the
patentability of washing maschines, ABS systems and other penny
dreadfuls (but no insuline tubes yet).*

## C4C-Contribution \"Lies and Deceptions from the FFII\" {#c4c_contribution_lies_and_deceptions_from_the_ffii}

-   2005-05-13 [C4C: Lies and Deceptions from the
    FFII](http://europeansoftwarepatents.blogspot.com/2005/05/lies-and-deceptions-from-ffii.html "wikilink")

## Information

From a content perspective only the terminology of C4C is somewhat
insightful:

`We are ALL against software patents because a software patent is `\
`an impossibility. Software is code. You cant patent it anymore `\
`than you can patent the text in a book.`

These are not those Software patents, which are a pain for developers.
This is not the understanding of FFII. Precisely this particular
understanding of C4c of the phrase software patent is totally absurd,
because no one is intrested in such patent protection, which
additionally protects the object under copyright - for a shorter period
of time and under higher fees. It sounds riddiculous, and therefore no
one follows this semantics, unless he has a certain intentions.

The software patents that FFII and its many supporters do not want
beeing codified by EU directive or other law are the patents that do
stop selling or otherwise spreading peoples very own and originally
written code in source or binary form and further banning its legal
execution on anyones machine because it resembles some amount of
software design and data processing ideas. As the average application
program does involve several hundreds to hundredthousands of ideas,
solutions and other microscopic inventive steps there is no practicable
way for ensuring that a specific software is ever free of software
patents from third partys. Only binding software to a purpose and a
physical effect that is used in an inventive manner can resolve the
situation. Only this way that will prevent serious harm (up to a stand
still) for most market participants that do spend money on their very
own development department. The innovative process must not be
endangered and software development must remain an open business.

`If the FFII really only wanted to prevent software patents, `\
`they [..] would support the Council of Ministers position,`\
`which explicitly rules out patents on software, `

Such \"C4C-Software patents\" are probably excluded by the
Bolkestein-Insert in the context of the Council text (but nothing else)

`Articke 4.1 A computer program as such cannot contitute a patentable invention.`

And even this exclusion only holds when code does not get executed.
Further a computer programm can be claimes according to Article 5.2. It
suggest what complicated interpretation is ahead of case law because of
the Article 4.1.

According to the European Patent Convention, \"Programmes for
computers\" [ as such](AssuchEn "wikilink") are no inventions and thus
not patetentable. Via the Bolkestein-insert Article 4.1 in fact **no
limiting effect** takes place, as the non-patentable software is
redefined as something like the \"C4C-software patent\". Further article
4 codified the EPO teaching of the further technical effect, which the
EPO developed in exspectation of a planned deletion of EPC 52.2.

Perhaps here the [definition of the term computer-implemented inventions
according to EPO-examination guidelines is somewhat
helpful](http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/gui_lines/e/c_iv_2_3_6.htm "wikilink"):

`2.3.6 Programs for computers`\
`Programs for computers are a form of "computer-implemented invention",`\
`an expression intended to cover claims which involve computers, computer`\
`networks or other conventional programmable apparatus whereby prima facie`\
`the novel features of the claimed invention are realised by means of a `\
`program or programs. `

Almost quoted you find it in the [Council directive
proposal](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st11/st11979-re01.en04.pdf "wikilink").

`Artikel 2 a: "computer-implemented invention" means`\
`any invention the performance of which involves the use `\
`of a computer, computer network or other programmable `\
`apparatus, the invention having one or more features which `\
`are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer`\
`program or computer programs;`

Again, note what EPO-examination guidelines explain:

`Programs for computers are a form of "computer-implemented invention",`

## Literature patents? No, Patents for book-implemented inventions {#literature_patents_no_patents_for_book_implemented_inventions}

Related to the example of the C4C as found above we might suggest a mind
game. The idea of patents for book-implemented inventions. In this
debate there were no literature patents, because **no one intended to
patent the text of a book**. But ideas of literature such as (Female
protagonist, characterised by\...) would be available as
book-implemented inventions for patent protection. For legal certainty
and harmonisation (some courts still stick to odd rules) in the European
single market, the Commissionn would propose a directive for the
patentability of book-implemented inventions. Oppenents of literature
patents would likely have to deal with lobbyists and Commissioners who
tell the [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"), book-implemented inventions comprised
book binding methods, Print maschines and typographs. And an association
of the print industry would lobby against the \"abolishment of patent
protection for book-implemented inventions\" and rally against the first
reading results. As read in the news: \"Literature patents - Print
industry is afraid of their inventions\".
