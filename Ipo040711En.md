IPO

-   opposes limitation of patentable subject matter
-   opposes stricter non-obviousness standards
-   opposes \"expansion\" of economic considerations into patent policy
-   agrees that USPTO needs more funding.

In earlier years, silence about some of the questions raised by the FTC
report would have been the preferred option. Today it is not, IPO seems
to be feeling real pressure.
