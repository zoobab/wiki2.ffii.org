# The Blackberry Case {#the_blackberry_case}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Blackberry case can be viewed as an illustration of the software
patents threat. If software patents granted by the European Patent
Office (EPO) were legalized, there would a lot of \"Blackberry case\"
breaking in the European Union

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Briefly

-   Blackberry is a product of Research In Motion (RIM), the innovative
    leading marketer of wireless solutions
-   Since 2001, RIM has been sued for infringing five software patents
    held by NTP
-   In 2006, RIM had to pay \$612.5 million to settle a patent lawsuit
    with NTP. Presently, RIM is being sued by Visto
-   The Blackberry case illustrates that software patent are dangerous
    to innovative and competitive businesses
-   The Blackberry case is not an isolated one. Recently Apple and
    Creative Labs have been engaging in a software patent war,
    undoubtedly an expansive and non-profiting one
-   If software patent were legalized in EU, as it is in the U.S with
    the USPTO, they would not serve innovation and free competition.
    They would certainly used by powerful companies to sue innovative
    and high-profiting [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")

## RIM, a model of innovative and competitive company {#rim_a_model_of_innovative_and_competitive_company}

-   Research in Motion (RIM) is the leading manufacturer and marketer of
    wireless solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market.

## The USPTO context {#the_uspto_context}

-   For most of US history, patents had traditionally been issued in
    tangible objects. Thus, the USPTO took a hard line against granting
    patents only on intangibles like software or business methods.
-   All that changed in the 1980s, when Congress concentrated patents
    appellate duties in a single court  the Court of Appeals for the
    Federal Circuit. Over time, that court changed course on software
    and other questionable areas of patent, transforming the system from
    one that was highly conservative to one thats much more liberal
-   The result was a rush for software and other patents that began in
    the 1990s and continues today. The irony of the patent system is
    that while its relatively easy to get a patent, the vast majority
    of the assigned patents are completely worthless. Yet companies like
    NTP were smart enough to realize that if you played the odds, there
    might be a billion-dollar case out there somewhere

## RIM vs NTP {#rim_vs_ntp}

-   It was in this environment that David Stout, co-founder of New
    Technologies Products (NTP), a former examiner and experienced
    patent lawyer, filed for a series of patents premised on wireless
    e-mail in the early 1990s. Arguably his patents should never have
    been granted; the idea of wireless e-mail is just too obvious to
    merit patent
-   NTP did not make the popular a wireless e-mail product, like the now
    ubiquitous RIMs product Blackberry. But NTP had five trivial
    patents concerning wireless e-mail technology. These software
    patents enabled NTP to sue the profitable RIM

-   Hear is the chronology of the Blackberry case

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   -   November 2002. Accused of infringing five patents belonging to
        NTP, RIM is first condemned to pay 23.1 million dollars in a
        simplified procedure.
    -   August 2003. In vain, the Canadian company makes the decision to
        go the Court of the first instance in August. The judge raises
        the condemnation to 53.7 million dollars and prohibits the
        selling of Blackberry terminals on the American territory. The
        only problem is that the U.S market represents nearly 70% of the
        RIMs sales
    -   2004\. To suspend the application of the judgment, RIM decides
        to inject appeal. The company makes publish very good financial
        results.
    -   March 2005. Having a really good financial health, RIM tries to
        reach an amicable agreement with NTP. They first agree on an
        amount of 450 million dollars. But finally NTP does not sign the
        agreement because of a different concerning the licences.
    -   2006\. To avoid the threat of the prohibition of the Blackberry,
        RIM settled its case with NTP and agrees to pay 612.5 million
        dollars.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   As we can see below, the amount of the amicable agreement paid is
    far beyond RIM profits in 2005. How can we say that software patents
    aims at promoting free innovation and fair competition?

## RIM vs Visto {#rim_vs_visto}

-   Visto, mobile E-mail technology to wireless carriers marketer,
    recently won a case in which a federal court ordered Seven Networks
    to pay it \$3.6 million in damages for patent infringement
-   Emboldened by the win, Visto attorneys that same day filed a lawsuit
    against RIM, claiming it infringed on four of its patents, three of
    which are identical to those in Visto\'s lawsuit against Seven
    Networks

## The future of RIM {#the_future_of_rim}

Three scenarii remain possible for RIM

-   1\. RIM maintains its existing strategy and is overwhelmed by
    competition. Being a high-profiting firm, RIM will probably remain
    the target of patent firms. And the Canadian firm will carry on
    accepting patent claims, even unfair ones, because it is cheaper
    than fighting them. But RIM will have alos to lower prices to face
    the concurrence and resist software patent attacks. And finally,
    having lost all possibility of profits, all investors left, RIM will
    disappear

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   2\. RIM increases its software patenting and lowers prices to
    compete. RIM will have to adopt the same strategy of of concurrent
    firms and will lose his money in patent attorneys instead of
    increasing innovation

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   3\. However, a third optional scenario is possible that is software
    should not be patentable. If patent system was not applied to
    software in the US, RIM would remain competitve and would not be
    threatened by patent trolls. Software market will be better with
    copyright protection

## The software patent threat in Europe {#the_software_patent_threat_in_europe}

-   Software patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) belong
    in majority to US (43%) or Japanese (30%) powerful Companies, thus
    creating software patents oligopolies
-   If software patent were legalized in the European Union, they would
    surely be used by these companies to sue innovative and competitive
    EU businesses
-   EU Businesses are often small and medium enterprises that cannot
    afford a long and costly trial
-   Moreover, the legalization of software patent would encourage the
    development of « patent trolls » as specialised firms in patent
    litigation collecting strategic patents to sue high-profiting
    companies to get royalties. A patent troll neither performs research
    nor manufactures products incorporating its patented technology. A
    patent troll is a non-producing entity profiting from the patent
    system failures. Basically, patent trolls are bad for software
    economy
-   If software patents were legalized in the European Union, as it the
    case in the US, such menace as patent troll and other Blackberry
    case would be reality
