*2005-04-20 \-- The Student Organisation of the University of Ljubljana
(SOU) has performed the first study ever on software patents in
Slovenia. They sent a questionnaire to the members of the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) asking them whether they agree
with the association\'s push for software patents, on which the
government\'s support for the software patents directive is based. The
results show that the Slovenian IT industry overwhelmingly opposes
software patents.*

The Student Parliament of the University of Ljubljana (SOU) has adopted
[a resolution](http://www.sou-lj.si/novica/?leto=2005&id=35 "wikilink")
in which it asks government of Slovenia to drop support for the software
patents directive. The Communication and Information Service of SOU
(KISS) researched how many companies in the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry of Slovenia (GZS) support the directive. Since only the opinion
of the Association of Informatics and Telecommunication was considered
when the GZS decided to support the directive, only those members were
considered in this study as well.

A questionnaire was sent to all 1223 members belonging to that group,
asking the following questions:

-   How big is your company? *(1 employee, 1-5 employees, 5-10
    employees, 10-50 employees, 50+ employees)*
-   What does your company do? *(develop software, sell hardware, web
    development, internet provider, sell foreign software, other)*
-   Do you feel influenced by multinational software companies? *(agree,
    partly agree, neural, partly disagree, disagree)*
-   Do you support the directive? *(yes, no, not informed enough)*
-   Did Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia ask you about the
    directive? *(yes, no)*

By 31 March 2005, they had received 229 answers. Of the companies that
answered,

-   40 (19%) were not informed enough to take a decision
-   183 (79%) were against software patents
-   6 (2%) were in favour.

Since only 6 of the answering companies supported the directive, no
meaningful statistics based on the other questions can be derived
regarding the characterisation of proponents and opponents. It is
however interesting to note that from these 229 companies, only 7 were
asked about the directive by the GZS and of those only 2 supported it.

KODA, one section of the Slovenian Association of Informatics and
Telecommunication, already [ spoke out against software
patents](Koda0412En "wikilink") in the past. They however don\'t have
any voting rights in the association. Reportedly, no vote was even ever
held on this issue.
