## Comments

[ Christoph Then](ChristophThenEn "wikilink"): \"The Office did not
admit the possibility of appealing to the next-higher level. That would
have been the Enlarged Board of Appeal. Thereby the situation is now
legally inextricable, because the legal basis has been de facto put out
of force.\"

[ Hartmut Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink"): \"The wording tricks by
which the EPO sidesteps its statutory law are the same which it uses to
justify software patents. It just pretends that the law excludes only
narrow claims to the object in questions but allows broad claims which
cover the same object. Also, as in the software patent case, the
Technical Board of Appeal is deciding alone and the Enlarged Board of
Appeal, which is more authoritative in matters of interpretation of law,
is not consulted. The powerholders in the EPO are thereby bypassing not
only the law but also their own semi-independent judicial
institutions.\"
