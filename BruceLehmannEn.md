------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bruce Lehmann presided over the USPTO for a few years in the 90s and is
still active at WIPO as a patent expert and patent evangelist. He firmly
believes in the beneficiality of the system and the need to promote it
throughout the world and to all \"fields of technology\", including
computing and business methods. Espoused his beliefs at [ OECD meeting
of 2003/08 in Paris](Swpoecd038En "wikilink"), appeared aggressively
pro-patent even in comparison with the EPO representatives, paralelled
only by the USPTO representative Boland.
