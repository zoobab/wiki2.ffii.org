-   Norway is not a member of the European Patent Convention
-   Currently the Norwegian Parliament is deliberating about membership
    in the EPC
-   Membership in the EPC means accepting [EPO
    patents](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/stats/ "wikilink") in Norway
-   For SE, DK and other countries membership means accepting that
    national patent (case)law is made in Munich and not subject to
    scrutiny even by the national constitutional court
