= Portal Sapo urges MEPs against software patents =

Lisboa, July 6, 2005 -- Today, the European Parliament votes for a set
of amendments to the Council's proposal on the software patent direcitve,
and the portal Sapo.pt joins the protests, based upon its history, urging
the MEPs to vote for a good directive.

    In our scale, it is important that small, medium and large enterprises
    understand this, patents suffocate, they don't stimulate development.
    We don't aim to have an "intellectual property portfolio" over which
    we gain economical benefits. We aim to innovate and give the portuguese
    innovation made in Portugal.

    I honestly hope that tomorrow the MEPs don't loose this opportunity
    of making a positve milestone in history. Be present in the plenary and
    vote fo the 21 cross-partisan amendments proposed by Rocard - Ribeiro e
    Castro - Buzek - Figueiredo - Queiró - Duff - Roithova.


So concludes Celso Martinho, Product Technology Director of SAPO, in his
editorial at the new site http://softwarelivre.sapo.pt/

The portal begins by presenting some articles about the software patents
subject, and also directly links to the Eurolinux petition against software
patentes http://petition.eurolinux.org/index_html?LANG=pt

    Imagine of you're Victor Hugo, who in 1962 published ''Lés Misérables'',
    and suddenly came a lawyser accusing you of patent infringement over
    a communication process that represents, in the mind of a reader, the
    concept of a character who has been in jail for a long time and
    subsequently changes his name? Or if Haydn had patented a symphony,
    characterised by that sound is produced (in extended sonata form )?
    Mozart would have been in trouble!

    Seems unreal? What if we're talking about delivering a gift to a third party?
    Or opening an [[http://webshop.ffii.org/|on-line shop]] and loose your
    business in 20 simple steps?

Points out ANSOL in its page, alluding to patent EP927945, a business method patent
granted by the European Patent Office (EPO), and the clarifying http://webshop.ffii.org/
site that shows this and 19 other business methods and software patents granted by the
EPO in these last years, that would easily draw an on-line business to serious difficulties.
