== About ==

 * [:KwikiEn: KWiki] is a wiki system. Write access is partially restricted but yet easy to obtain.

Depending on which language you are reading the FFII pages in, on top of each page you will see a button labeled "Wiki" or "Addenda":

 * Example of static page: http://swpat.ffii.org/akteure/giev/index.de.html

Click this button to view a page that is attached to the FFII page (like a sticky note). 

 * Example of associated, editiable comments page: http://kwiki.ffii.org/SwpatgievDe

Click the Edit symbol http://www.ffii.org/kwikimj04/pict/e2.gif to add your comments right from the browser (Start using just plain text. If you want some formatting, check out WikiHelp).

Use the link [:=Back :to associated FFII page] to go back to the static, non-editable FFII page.

We are constantly reviewing comments, suggestions and corrections that our readers contribute. Some contributions will lead to changes in an associated static FFII page or even creation of a new document. Others we'll just leave on the comments page for further discussion.

If you want to create a static page of your own, please make this page end with a capitalised ISO language suffix, e.g. 'En' for English, 'De' for German, 'Fr' for French, 'Sv' for Swedish, 'Cs' for Czech.

If you have any suggestions for improvements to this system, please edit KwikiEn or contact kwiki-help at ffii org.

'''Thank you for participating!'''

==  Version ==

Our system relies on a slightly customized version of [http://www.kwiki.org Kwiki] respectively [http://kwikimj.kn.vutbr.cz/index.cgi KwikiMJ]. Kwiki is written in Perl and [http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Kwiki/ available on CPAN].

[:AktivChangeLogEn: The change log of bug-fixes and extensions/improvements to the participation system] contains notes about system failure incidents where [:AktivEn: Aktiv] was affected.
