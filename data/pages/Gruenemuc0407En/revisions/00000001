The Greens' motion was accepted on the Munich city assembly without opposition and one abstention. Especially a detrimental effect on the city's IT expenses was feared by patentability of software (Munich recently startet a switch to Linux).

It addresses the Green National assembly starting in the beginning of October.

Generally the Green National assembly, by the principle of "basis democracy", can oblige the Green politicians in the Berlin government to follow its motions.
