''The British Computer Society is a large and prestigious union of people working in computer programming and related fields of theory and practise.  A former president of BCS took strong positions against software patents at a hearing in London 1998.  Recently, the Computer Society website has endorsed pro-patent fallacies and recommended hardline pro-patent campaign groups.''
