== Synopsis ==

Novell today publicly commited to use its patent portfolio to protect its open
source software offerings. In a policy statement, Novell said it would utilize
its patent portfolio to defend against potential intellectual property attacks
by others on its open source products. The statement serves to reassure
customers that they can choose open source solutions with confidence, knowing
they have strong backing from Novell on patent issues.

== Quotes ==

"In the event the European Union were to allow broader patentability of
software, Novell would nonetheless be able to freely market its software
offerings, whether closed or open source, in Europe and other jurisdictions
that presently favor software patents."

Yesterday [:Limux04En: Munich City] announced that they would in the future
demand patent indemnification as part of their contract conditions for
(OSS-related ?) software contracts.

== Comments ==

## This comment cited some wrong assumtions, it's better to remove parts and turn it into a more genera comment than having to
## critisise the drafter for misrepresenting what Novell really said.

When the text says that "the current regime has served the industry
well, directive not needed", he could have copy&pasted this from [:SwpateictaEn: EICTA]'s
hardline-pro-patent statements.  In the EPO software patent professional's ear, this 
is a statement in favor of unlimited patentability according to the EPO's recent
standards, which, as far as general-purpose software is concerned, do not significantly differ from those of the US.

However in the ear of unexperienced software developpers at Novell in Europe
(e.g. !SuSE), it sounds as if Novell was supporting the provisions of the
current European law, which clearly forbid software patents.

Novell's lawyers reinforce this misunderstanding by treating the
[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ Council's version] of
the text as the only version on the table and avoiding any mention of the
[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/ Parliament's version].  By taking
a position on the Parliament's version, he would have had to reveal himself.

Novell's lawyers clearly needed to hide their positions in this way,
because it is well known that most of Novell's employees dislike the software
patent system and some national sections have even made this clear in public
statements (see e.g. Warszawa040510En).

Nobody can expect Novell to bear the enormous burden of "defending opensource
software".  Nobody can blame Novell for rationally playing the patent game, which
was imposed on our business community by external forces.

We would however have hoped that Novell take an unambiguous stand on the
public policy questions concerning the basic rules of exclusivity and
competition of the software business community.  This is a minimum requirement
of "social responsibility", a much-cited value in corporate image brochures.
