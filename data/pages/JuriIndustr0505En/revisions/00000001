75 is a reprise of the industry definition from first reading.

81 = 82 is a slightly more liberal version of that amendment, by replacing "automated" with "commercially organised".

77 = 78 = 79 provides a negative definition of industrial application, by stating that the production and distribution of information good (such as computer programs) is not an industry in the sense of patent law. Carriers on which information goods can be stored (such as CD's or DVD's) are obviously not affected by this provision (a plastic disc filled with some metal-oxide is not an "information good").
