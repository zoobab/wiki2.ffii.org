We are pleased to present you the convention "Knowledge as public common
property: software, data, know-how". Organized by CSI-Piemonte on 17th-18th
November in Turin, the event will be focused on what obstacles impede broad
access to the ever-growing heritage of knowledge and what strategies can
reconcile privacy and security rights and market pressure for protection of
information property (patents, licenses, copyrights, etc.) with the goal of
free access for all to information and the software to handle it (free and
open source).

Privately-owned  companies,  government agencies and ICT personalities will
take  part in the convention: Lawrence Lessig (Stanford Law School), Angelo
Raffaele  Meo  (Polytechnic of Torino), Luciano Gallino, Alberto Piazza and
Marco  Ricolfi (University of Torino), Alberto J. Cañas (University of West
Florida),  Alberto  Primo  Braga  (World  Bank), European Commission, Carlo
Batini  (University  of  Milano), Jean-Pierre Dardayrol (CGTI), Georg Greve
(Free  Software Foundation), Leonardo Chiariglione (Digital Media Project),
Andrea  Valboni  (Microsoft  Italia),  Hellmuth  Broda  (Sun Microsystems),
Renato Peditto (IBM).

The programme and the registration form (to be filled by 19th October) are
available on the Web site http://www.csi.it/opensource_eng.

Thank you for your attention and for the diffusion of the event that you would like to give,

Yours sincerely
