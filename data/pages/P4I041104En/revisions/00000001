 Industry Makes its Voice Heard on 'Computer Implemented Inventions'

 The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are about to decide on the future of the patent system in Europe.

 On the new web site www.patents4innovation.org, developed with Intellect's sister trade associations across Europe under  
 the co-ordination of our European Trade Association EICTA, we try to explain the debate currently going on about the 
 Computer Implemented Inventions draft directive and to shed light on the different approaches regarding this complex 
 subject, especially why we believe that CIIs are beneficial for Europe's investment climate and European Innovations.


 In parallel with the launch of the web site Intellect is calling on Member States and the new European Parliament to 
 accept the text adopted by the Council of Ministers in May 2004.

 Members wanting more information or who are willing to add their voice to this campaign are invited to contact:
