''4 March 2005 -- In a public statement, Dr. Zuzana Roithova, member of the European Parliament for the European People's Party and vice-chairwoman of Parliament's Committee for the Internal Market and  Consumer Protection, strongly criticises the attempts of the Commission and Council to adopt the zombie software patent agreement of May 2004 without a qualified majority and calls on the Czech government to support moves for reopening of negotiations.''

Roithova announced today the Council informed her that the directive 
will be approved as an A-item on Monday, and all the three request for restart from
European Parliament will be ignored.

Roithova requested more information from the Czech government about their position, and received a reply stating
that the Czech minister will vote in favour on Monday. Consequently, she publicly announced that
that she requests that the Czech goverment:

 * Requests a B-item in the Council
 * votes NO in case that there will be vote on Monday
 * should support the restart and should be working on a constructive text, made with respect to public

She said:

 "I believe that common sense will win, because the Council can otherwise
  only expect a vote against the whole directive from most of the MEPs"
