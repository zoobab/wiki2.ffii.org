= 2004-05-14 French Patent Office Lying in Name of Government =

The French governmnent is apparently leaving Patent Policy Matters entirely to its Patent Office.

In a response to an inquiry, Pierre Vallat from INPI (Institut National pour la Propriété Intellectuelle)
spread the usual set of fallacies known from the EPO and the European Commission's Industrial Property Unit, saying that US-style software patents don't harm free software and that the Council's proposal is suitable for preventing such patents, essentially like that of the Parliament but in conformance with the [http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trips/ TRIPs treaty] which the Parliament's version allegedly violates (see also [http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/epet0929/index.en.html Philippe Aigrain's speech to the Parliament on this well-known and expected "lie of the last resort"]).

Since 2000 French industry ministers and heads of government, including former industry minister Christian Pierret and the current president Jacques Chirac, have made it very clear that they want Europe's software business to be patent-free.  Yet they have left the matter in the hands of the patent office, whose officials have always done the opposite of what their bosses told them to do.  There is a regular pattern of patent officials in France (and elsewhere) saying what they want, without respecting even written instructions from their government.  Politicians tend to grow tired of the long unintelligible patent gibberish which their patent officials present to them and then to just leave matters in their hands.  A recent [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cec0405/ paper by the European Commission] also confirms that France is opposing the Council's moves only at a symbolic level, while "at a technical level" they have signalled agreement.

The current answer of the INPI in the name of the french government perfectly reflects this state of affairs.
