''Brussels, Nov 22th 2005 -- European Parlement has driven a hearing on the proposed directive on criminal measures aimed at the prosecution of product piracy and counterfeit, especially in the context of organised crime. Because of careless drafting the text, known as IPRED 2 (2nd Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive) has severe flaws because it avoids clear definitions. FFII has pointed out some crucial dangers, specially concerning the criminalisation of daily business with patents and trademarks in such a "carpet-bombing lawmaking".''

== Report from the EP hearing on IPRED2 directive  ==

In a first hearing on the IPRED2 directive and framework, many representatives spoke out against criminal sanctions on patent violations, or voiced concerns over them. Among them were BEUC, BSA, FFII, Sun, FSFE, British Telecom, and a representative from the pharmaceutical industry. The FFII pointed out it is impossible not to violate software patents, the IPRED 2 directive threatens Europe's software developers with imprisonment. The International Trademark Association presented a position paper in which they recommend to limit the scope to trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) representative was among those most in favour of the directive, she asked for even stronger enforcement measures, like access to retained telecommunication data. The FSFE commented that the directive will add unnecessary risks and costs to software development in general and could stifle some free software development models. 

The rapporteur On. Nicola Zingaretti, MEP, said the Juri commission will meet on the subject next week ([http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/oj/590/590237/590237en.pdf see item 5 on JURI agenda for 29/11/2005 meeting])


== FFII's position presented with the following statement at the hearing  ==

  IPRED2: Adding criminal sanctions to a legal minefield

  In order to fight piracy, IPRED 2 makes all commercial violations of
  intellectual property rights" a crime. All commercial violations.
  But not all commercial violations of these rights are piracy.
  Trademark and patent infringements are always commercial
  infringements, but by no means always piracy. This criminalisation
  of acts by commercial organisations that are not pirates is very
  serious. The principal issue is that IPRED 2 confuses piracy and
  commercial infringement. IPRED 2 criminalises companies that are
  not pirates.

  - Take copyright. The question whether a work is an independent
  recreation or a violation of copyright is a subtle question.
  Questions like these should be handled in civil courts, not in
  criminal courts. For reasons of human rights, criminal laws require
  precise definitions. And criminal law should be the ultimum
  remedium. With IPRED 2, any journalist can be prosecuted that makes
  a citation that is a bit too long. 

  - Take Patent law. Patent law definitions are unclear and drifting.
  In some sectors, like the software industry, it is impossible not to
  violate patents. Microsoft has been violating many patents, and had
  to pay huge damages. But do we really want to see Bill Gates in
  prison? He can go to jail, together with Europe's software
  developers, since IPRED 2 criminalises companies that are not
  pirates.

  Trade mark counterfeiting and copyright piracy are already forbidden
  in European countries. On a world-wide scale, the TRIPS treaty sees
  to that. Furthermore, IPRED 1 is being implemented right now. At the
  moment no assessment can be made whether an instrument is missing.
  Yet prison sentences go up more than a 100 times in some cases.
  IPRED 2 is excessive and distorts carefully balanced national
  procedural law systems.

  For the sake of protection of carefully balanced national procedural
  law systems, subsidiarity and legal security, 
  in order to keep Europe's software developers out of jail, 
  we ask you to reject these superfluous and detrimental proposals.

  The European Parliament rejected the software patents directive. We
  heartily thank you for that. The IPRED 2 directive and framework
  should go the same way.

  Thank you.

== Additional comments  ==

 * Ante Wessels, FFII's representative at this hearing, adds:

  Revelation of documents by an investigating journalist can violate
  copyright laws and so become a crime with very severe sanctions.
  This would then allow the prosecution of journalists as 
  criminals. This threat endangers the freedom of the press. 

  Ironically, the European Publishers Council presented a position paper 
  which suggests to raise the maximum custodial sentence to 10 years. 
  Rather amazing to see so many CEOs of leading European newspapers 
  endangering their own freedom. 

 * Thomas Warawis (FFII-AT) comments:
## 34567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
  Because of the situation in patent, and trademark law, the outcome
  of litigation in the IT field is highly unpredictable. This was
  confirmed by international experts in a study for the Commission. In
  these sectors the prosecution of infringement of not foreseeable
  rights is illegal. There is no doubt that product piracy, counterfeit
  and money laundering is crime. FFII also would support improvements
  in copy- and author rights, but they have to carry forward the
  beneficial balance, that is achieved between the immaterial rights
  of producers, commercial- and end customers.
