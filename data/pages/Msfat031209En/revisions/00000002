As discussed with entertaining sarcasm at

and [[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/04/1318212&mode=thread|Slashdot]]
and [[http://www.aful.org/wws/arc/patents/2003-12/|on the patents list at aful]],
Microsoft is kicking off an new IP-licencing policy by highlighting its 
patents on the look-up scheme for translating long-form FAT filenames 
into DOS 8.3 filenames.

[[HartmutPilchEn| Hartmut Pilch]], president of FFII, explains

  According to European Patent Conventions, as reconfirmed recently by the
  European Parliament, we should have nothing to fear in Europe.  The patents
  which the EPO granted are clearly invalid, because the claimed subject
  matter is confined to rules for computation on conventional data
  processing equipment, objectionable either as a ''program for computers'' or as
  an ''intellectual method'', ''mathematical method'' or a ''method of presenting information''.

  Moreover the use that Microsoft intends is also objectionable on competition
  grounds.  Article 6a of the European Parliament's amendments makes this
  explicit: the use of a patented technique for the sole purpose of
  interoperation (conversion between data representation formats) should never be
  considered a infringement.

  Recently we have been observing a clear tendency at Microsoft to
  embark on extreme and unethical uses of patents, similar to those
  observed at IBM earlier.  IBM's former IP manager Marshall Phelps,
  known for the "IBM tax" which his department has imposed on the US
  software industry, was recently hired by Microsoft as their new "IP
  leader".  We are currently witnessing the introduction of a
  "Microsoft tax" on the US software industry.  Europe will however be
  a safe haven if we can influence the national governments so that
  they follow the law, the principles of democracy and the voice of
  the software producers and users, rather than just the voice of
  their ministerial patent lawyers, who are still dominating the
  legislative process at the Euroepan Commission and most national
  governments.

Bernhard Kaindl, a German software developper and active member of
FFII, comments:

  FAT has been developed without ever hearing of a patent and now that
  everybody adopted it because it was no cost, it reduces funds for
  new FAT devices by 0,25 EUR per unit.

  The FAT case illustrates clearly what is also true for all other
  software-related patents that I have come across so far: they serve
  to promote further patents and not real software innovation.

  The patenting activity combined with the much too long life span of
  patents in the software field results in patent thickets which cause
  trouble for new innovations.

  Moreover, typical patent licensing policies such as those of
  Microsoft's FAT cap the license fee at a fixed amount, thereby
  putting smaller companies at a disadvantage and completely excluding
  free software.

== Comments from Microsoft's Chief Patent Strategist ==

Here for your reading delight are today's 
[[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2003/dec03/12-03ExpandIPQA.asp|comments]]
from [[MarshallPhelpsEn| MS's Deputy General Counsel for IP, Marshall Phelps]], 
on the importance of patent protection :

  PressPass: There are those who say that patents stifle innovation. How 
  would you respond to them?

  Phelps: The free and open exchange of ideas is an important ingredient 
  in creating and fostering an innovative environment, but it's not the 
  only ingredient. Motivation and incentive also are critical to sustained 
  and ongoing innovation, especially in the context of large, complex 
  systems that software programs often must implement. History shows that 
  nations and countries with robust IP laws to protect the creative works 
  of authors and inventors are at an advantage. Strong IP laws promote 
  innovation and differentiationï¿½both of which ultimately benefit the 
  customer. Patents are part of the U.S. Constitution, and firms such as 
  IBM have been patenting software-related inventions for over 30 years. 
  The fact is, the last 30 years have seen unprecedented innovation in the 
  IT sector.


  PressPass: Why is it important to protect IP?

  Phelps: The spirit of innovation is something we value passionately. 
  Microsoft firmly believes that innovation is the fundamental component 
  of progress and growth in the IT industry. We believe it is the 
  essential foundation for the delivery of great new products and that it 
  fuels ongoing R&D.

  Companies like Microsoft engage in applied research to develop products 
  that advance the state of technology. In turn, that generates jobs, 
  profits and tax revenues that boost the economy, which, as part of the 
  process, funds additional research. Companies also contribute the 
  results of innovation directly into the larger body of technical 
  knowledge. If software companies are not compensated for the investments 
  they make in R&D, the cycle of sustainable innovation is disrupted. When 
  that happens, the overall health of the software industry is jeopardized.

  Microsoft is committed to a business model that protects the IP rights 
  in software, just like any other technology, and ensures the continued 
  vitality of an independent software sector that generates revenue and 
  will sustain ongoing R&D. Our commitment to innovation is reflected in 
  our industry leading annual budget for R&D.


  PressPass: Do you feel the IT industry as a whole benefits from IP 
  licensing?

  Phelps: Absolutely. A healthy, fluid intellectual property marketplace 
  is essential for a strong IT ecosystem. The revenues generated by IP 
  licenses make it possible for companies like Microsoft to consistently 
  invest in R&D. The industry is continually adopting the innovations that 
  are a direct result of R&D spending and this leads to an increase in 
  deployment. When you have increased deployment, the opportunity for 
  further innovation downstream becomes available -- by both the 
  originating company and potential licensees. This downstream innovation 
  is what generates new IP, which generates new licensing, which generates 
  new revenue. By utilizing this revenue for additional R&D, it furthers 
  the cycle of innovation and that, of course, is a lasting benefit to the 
  industry.

Note that Phelps refers to patents only once.  What he says about "IP" is
largely a general consensus, provided that it is understood that "IP" in the
context of software means "copyright".  In other words, even Phelps is not
able to advance any argument in favor of software patents.
