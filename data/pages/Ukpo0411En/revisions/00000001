The UK Patent Office, which is in charge of the UK government's patent policy as part of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), has published on its server a glossy brochure to spread a very partial view of the proposed EU directive "on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions"; which the UK Patent Office has been trying to achieve for the last 10 years, to confirm and impose on the rest of Europe its practice of granting software patents, against the letter and spirit of the 1973 European Patent Convention.
