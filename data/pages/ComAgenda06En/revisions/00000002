 * 2nd quarter 2006 - INFSO - Communication on security issues (spam, malware, etc)	
   * Building on the 2002 e-Privacy Directive and the subsequent Communication on spam, many efforts have been made to fight spam. Fighting spam works but the threat is evolving. Spam is increasingly sophisticated, fraudulent (e.g. phishing) or indeed criminal; also it is increasingly a vehicle for related activities based on programmes like spyware and malware. These security threats are undermining user confidence and hence, the value of the Internet and electronic communications. This is why they have been banned by EU law (e.g. e-Privacy Directive, Framework Decision on Attacks against information systems). However, legislation is not enough and will only produce results if combined with enforcement measures, industry cooperation and best practices, and better user awareness. International cooperation is also important. This Communication will address these issues.

For that, the connectivity (interoperability) of the systems is needed for easy access to vital information. This Commission Staff Working Paper will address these issues.

 * 2006/05 - INFSO - Communication proposing a comprehensive strategy for ICT for Independent Living

 * 2006/05 - INFSO -  Second Commission Recommendation on safe and efficient in-vehicle information and communication systems: A European Statement of Principles on Human Machine Interface	
   * The 1st Commission Recommendation on Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) dates from December 1999 and was published in the Official Journal of 25.01.2000 (L19 page 64). Being almost six years old, it does not reflect any more the state of the technological development. In addition, the publication of a later update was already foreseen in the 1st Recommendation and was also mentionned as a possibility in the 2st eSafety Communication. These are the reasons for issuing a new Recommendation.	 

 * 2006/05 - INFSO - Communication on a strategy for a secure information society "Strengthening Trust in ICT"
