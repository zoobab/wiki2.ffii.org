= The Blackberry Case =

----

The Blackberry case can be viewed as an illustration of the software patents threat. If software patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) were legalized, there would a lot of "Blackberry case" breaking in the European Union

----


== Briefly ==

 * Blackberry is a product of Research In Motion (RIM), the innovative leading marketer of wireless solutions
 * Since 2001, RIM has been sued for infringing five software patents held by NTP
 * In 2006, RIM had to pay $612.5 million to settle a patent lawsuit with NTP. Presently, RIM is being sued by Visto
 * The Blackberry case illustrates that software patent are dangerous to innovative and competitive businesses
 * The Blackberry case is not an isolated one. Recently Apple and Creative Labs have been engaging in a software patent war, undoubtedly an expansive and non-profiting one 
 * If software patent were legalized in EU, as it is in the U.S with the USPTO, they would not serve innovation and free competition. They would certainly used by powerful companies to sue innovative and high-profiting SMEs 



== RIM, a model of innovative and competitive company ==

 * Research in Motion (RIM) is the leading manufacturer and marketer of wireless solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market. 


== The USPTO context ==

 * For most of US history, patents had traditionally been issued in tangible objects. Thus, the USPTO took a hard line against granting patents only on intangibles like software or business methods. 
 * All that changed in the 1980s, when Congress concentrated patents appellate duties in a single court  the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Over time, that court changed course on software and other questionable areas of patent, transforming the system from one that was highly conservative to one thats much more liberal
 * The result was a rush for software and other patents that began in the 1990s and continues today. The irony of the patent system is that while its relatively easy to get a patent, the vast majority of the assigned patents are completely worthless. Yet companies like NTP were smart enough to realize that if you played the odds, there might be a billion-dollar case out there somewhere


== RIM vs NTP ==

 * It was in this environment that David Stout, co-founder of New Technologies Products (NTP), a former examiner and experienced patent lawyer, filed for a series of patents premised on wireless e-mail in the early 1990s. Arguably his patents should never have been granted; the idea of wireless e-mail is just too obvious to merit patent
 * NTP did not make the popular a wireless e-mail product, like the now ubiquitous RIMs product Blackberry. But NTP had five trivial patents concerning wireless e-mail technology. These software patents enabled NTP to sue the profitable RIM

 * Hear is the chronology of the Blackberry case

   * November 2002. Accused of infringing five patents belonging to NTP, RIM is first condemned to pay 23.1 million dollars in a simplified procedure. 
   * August 2003. In vain, the Canadian company makes the decision to go the Court of the first instance in August. The judge raises the condemnation to 53.7 million dollars and prohibits the selling of Blackberry terminals on the American territory. The only problem is that the U.S market represents nearly 70% of the RIMs sales
   * 2004. To suspend the application of the judgment, RIM decides to inject appeal. The company makes publish very good financial results.
   * March 2005. Having a really good financial health, RIM tries to reach an amicable agreement with NTP.  They first agree on an amount of 450 million dollars. But finally NTP does not sign the agreement because of a different concerning the licences.
   * 2006. To avoid the threat of the prohibition of the Blackberry, RIM settled its case with NTP and agrees to pay 612.5 million dollars.


 * As we can see below, the amount of the amicable agreement paid is far beyond RIM profits in 2005. How can we say that software patents aims at promoting free innovation and fair competition? 

   * Last close: 	$83.64
   * Change from previous:	down 12¢
   * 52-week intraday high:	$105.39
   * 52-week intraday low:	$62.01
   * P/E ratio, trailing:	29.72
   * Dividend yield	- 
   * Market cap:	$15.48-billion
   * Price/book ratio:	6.96
   * 1-year total return:	-.90%
   * Revenue, fiscal 2005:	$2.07-billion
   * Profit, fiscal 2005:	$382.08-million

== RIM vs Visto  ==

 * Visto, mobile E-mail technology to wireless carriers marketer, recently won a case in which a federal court ordered Seven Networks to pay it $3.6 million in damages for patent infringement
 * Emboldened by the win, Visto attorneys that same day filed a lawsuit against RIM, claiming it infringed on four of its patents, three of which are identical to those in Visto's lawsuit against Seven Networks


== The future of RIM  ==

Three scenarii remain possible for RIM

 * 1.	RIM maintains its existing strategy and is overwhelmed by competition. Being a high-profiting firm, RIM will probably remain the target of patent firms. And the Canadian firm will carry on accepting patent claims, even unfair ones, because it is cheaper than fighting them. But RIM will have alos to lower prices to face the concurrence and resist software patent attacks. And finally, having lost all possibility of profits, all investors left, RIM will disappear

 * 2.	RIM increases its software patenting and lowers prices to compete. RIM will have to adopt the same strategy of of concurrent firms and will lose his money in patent attorneys instead of increasing innovation 

 * 3. However, a third optional scenario is possible that is software should not be patentable. If patent system was not applied to software in the US, RIM would remain competitve and would not be threatened by patent trolls. Software market will be better with copyright protection


== The software patent threat in Europe ==

 * Software patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) belong in majority to US (43%) or Japanese (30%) powerful Companies, thus creating software patents oligopolies
 * If software patent were legalized in the European Union, they would surely be used by these companies to sue innovative and competitive EU businesses 
 * EU Businesses are often small and medium enterprises that cannot afford a long and costly trial
 * Moreover, the legalization of software patent would encourage the development of « patent trolls » as specialised firms in patent litigation collecting strategic patents to sue high-profiting companies to get royalties. A patent troll neither performs research nor manufactures products incorporating its patented technology. A patent troll is a non-producing entity profiting from the patent system failures. Basically, patent trolls are bad for software economy
 * If software patents were legalized in the European Union, as it the case in the US, such menace as patent troll and other Blackberry case would be reality
