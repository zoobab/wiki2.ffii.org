Li mortacci di zio Billy...

I feel sick :-(

I am from Romania; my country is attending the UE. After reading about this, I would rather we didn't :)

---

Well... I'm from Poland, which is already an UE member. I'm afraid of this situation. I'm afraid of uhh... "Microsoft UE for Windows" :/

---

Exactly!! I also believe this is the problem: American companies (such as "uhh Microsoft" :)), and their interests and financial power.
---> certainly not...

I'm from Denmark; Why are people more affraid of microsoft than the threat of us loosing freedom of code?? This is in my eyes the main threat of this new angle the EU has adopted towards free software code..

''/My two cents/''

Don't feel sick, don't be afraid - do something about it! - write to your government, members of your parliament, inform the media, inform companies affected, ... there is a lot to do still

I am from Germany, and i hope that there can be found a way to bundle the
power again at the European Parliament. Lets hope that the software patents
topic does make some significant difference for the very next EP election.

I've written my government minister of technology and innovation about it, and my country (Belgium), alongside with Germany, has strongly opposed the Irish proposition that is backed by the Council (which overturns the Parliamentary vote).  The majority in our parliament has voted against it previously, and will do so again.  If large countries like France, Spain and Italy would clearly join the opposition, there would allready be much less incentive for the Council to press ahead.  So please, '''write''' your national governments and M.P's., remind them that the Council is jeopardising their own technological research and development, as well as commercial software business, growth, and ultimately, jobs.  

Look on your ffii site for recommendations about how to write a good letter, because a bad letter might have the opposite effect, so do not rave to them about how bad it is, but explain the negative effects patiently, clearly, and with good founded reason.  Let them know that you are not alone, but that small and mid-size commercial businesses, academics, doctoral students and governments all have great concerns about patenting software.  If no one protests, then the Council will have it's way, but there is still room to oppose the proposition, because the EU Parliament WILL be able to vote it down again.  But we (including you!) have to make sure that it does!

I am from the USA and I don't understand how an apparently unelected "council" can override the decisions of a democratically elected Parliament!  From the view on this side of the Atlantic, it looks like there is something terribly wrong with your law-making process.

As for the recent Mandrakesoft announcement regarding Microsoft, anything that is good for MS is bad for everyone else!  Microsoft must die!!!!!!!!!!

I am a freelance developer.  Am I now to patent all my 'inspirations'?  Is this not an unfair restriction of trade?  This is akin to patenting the common skill set of plumbers or electricians.  It seems that the UK government would like ALL software to be deveoped by LARGE corporations, and not small guys like me.  We must stop this now.
