In early november, the UK government - Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) - invited those concerned citizens who, by writing letters to their members of Parliament, questioned the government's policy on software patents and on the planned EU directive.  A row erupted before the meeting, because leading critics had not been invited.  At the meeting, most of the time was used for allowing the UK Patent Office people to present their case.  Yet, according to some reports, the backers of the European Parliament's Counter-Proposal were able promote their case fairly well.  It became evident that the Council's version lacks clarity and does not exclude from patentability the types of patents which the UKPO officials professed they wanted to exclude.
