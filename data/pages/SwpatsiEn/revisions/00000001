''As in many other countries, virtually all companies and associations from the software sector of Slovenia (e.g. KODA.si) want to pursue software creation based on copyright only, without interference of the patent system.  The Slovenian information industry ministry shares the same point of view.  Yet Slovenia voted with yes for a patent-extremist proposal in the European Council in May 2004.  Slovenia's policy in the Council seems to be decided by its "Intellectual Property Office", which has been sitting on the administrative council of the European Patent Office even before Slovenia joined the EU.  Support for software patents also came from Slovenia's chamber of industry and commerce, which took this decision against the opinion of 90% of its member base, as a later survey shows.''
