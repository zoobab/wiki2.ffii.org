while it does exactly the opposite): http://swpat.ffii.org/journal/04/cons0507/

It's now most urgent is to contact the official representatives of your country which
are in charge of this and inform them of the situation and dangers which it causes.

With this intention, one of the projects in which you could take part is to contribute
