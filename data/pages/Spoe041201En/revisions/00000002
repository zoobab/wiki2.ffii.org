== Some translated quotes: ==

=== From the PR of MP Siegi Lindenmayr  ===

  "Computer software should not be protected by patents -- copyright is sufficient."

  "However, at the EU level a directive is in the working that is supposed
  to enable such patents.  That is a clear circumvention of the European
  Patent Convention, in which computer programs and mathematics are clearly
  excluded from patentability.  Trusting this exclusion, small companies
  have justly ignored the patents on algorithms and business methods that 
  the European Patent Office has been granting during recent years.
  The SPOe sees such patent-granting as a massive threat to the domestic
  software business."  

  "I am happy to see some equally critical views expressed in other
   parties and therefore ask all Austrian Members of the European Parliament to
   demand a new discussion in the Council of Ministers".

=== Key Phrases of the Resolution ===

  "Computer programs are not inventions in the sense
  of patent law and already sufficiently protected by copyright.  The
  Federal Party Convention of SPOe therefore speaks up in the interest
  of the Austrian and European industry against the possibility of
  granting of software patents.
