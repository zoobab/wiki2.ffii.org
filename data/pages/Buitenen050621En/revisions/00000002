''21st June 2005 -- The Council's patent policy working party, consisting of ministerial patent officials from the member states, secretly met on May 27th to form a joint position on the Parliament's proposed amendments to the Council's Uncommon Position on software patents.  At that meeting, the Dutch representatives acted against promises given to their Parliament, positioning the Netherlands as a country that can not accept any limit on patentability with regard to software.  In a letter sent to the Council today, Paul van Buitenen, known as a "whistleblower" whose investigations forced a corrupt European Commission to resign, inquires about the legal basis for this kind of illoyalty in EU law and for sanctions available to bring the Council under democratic control.  Questions on a related matter by a colleague of Buitenen and by FFII have so far been ignored by the Council.''

  WRITTEN QUESTION E-2244/05
  by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE)
  to the Council
  Subject:Committees on patenting of software
  On 27 May 2005, a meeting of the Council's working group on intellectual property (patents) was held
  at which diplomats and officials discussed the issue of patenting of software.
  In a debate on 2 June 2005 in the Lower House of the Netherlands Parliament, State Secretary Van
  Gennip said that Dutch representatives should refrain from stating a position on behalf of the
  Netherlands until the Lower House had adopted one.
  The leaked minutes of the meeting reveal that the opposite is happening: the Netherlands is adopting a
  position of opposing amendments adopted by the European Parliament.
  1.      Who supervises the diplomats and officials who adopt positions in committees which may be
  diametrically opposed to a statement by the national authority concerned? Is it the Commission or the
  Member State in question?
  2.      How can a national parliament know whether officials representing it are honouring
  commitments given by the national government?
  3.      What is the relationship between these secret meetings and the Nice Treaty (Article 202),
  which lays down procedures to which committees must adhere? What penalties can be imposed if
  diplomats and/or officials adopt positions at a time when the Member State concerned has not yet
  announced its position or has undertaken not to adopt one?

  The Council assumes that what the Honourable Member is referring to is the
  Intellectual Property Attach√©s meeting of 27 May 2005 on the proposal for a
  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
  patentability of computer implemented inventions.
  
  In accordance with standard Council policy on transparency and openness to
  the public, the official invitation and agenda of that meeting (CM 1885/05)
  was automatically made available to the public immediately on the Council's
  web site (Public Register) where it can still be found.
  
  No minutes of that meeting have been drawn up by the Council Secretariat.
  
  Discussions taking place within Council bodies being confidential, the
  Council will not comment on the content of the "leaked minutes" referred to
  by the Honourable Member.
  
  Moreover, it has to be noted that Article 202 of the EC Treaty is not
  relevant in this area as the Council Working Parties are not of the same
  nature as the committees referred to in this article.
  
  Finally, as regards the specific questions posed by the Honourable Member
  about the means of exercising effective control over representatives of
  Member States, the Council wishes to point out that it is not for the
  Council but for the Member States themselves to take appropriate action, if
  and where this is deemed necessary, in order to ensure that the positions
  taken by the representatives on a given subject in a Council body duly
  reflect government policy.
