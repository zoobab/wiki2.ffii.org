According to the EU treaty, the Council's decision can be officially voted
6 weeks after all translations have become available and have been transmitted
to the Council members and to the European Parliament.

One possible session where the proposal could be on the agenda is the
Competitiveness Council session of 2004-09-24.

It is unclear to us when exactly these translations are said to have been
transmitted or published?  Is there a publication date before website publication?
Is transmission completed when the recipient (e.g. European Parliament) is on vacation?  

This needs to be investigated.
