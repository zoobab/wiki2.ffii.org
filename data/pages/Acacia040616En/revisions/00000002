According to Heise News, Acacia Research Inc has [[http://www.acaciaresearch.com/pr/061504.pdf|announced]] another series of lawsuits, this time against
cable and satellite tv operators who are said to be using methods for data transmission which Acacia owns.

Acacia also owns European Patents with a similar claim scope and has used them to extort money in Europe.
Especially Danish and Swedish companies have been affected.
They started from the porn web business and then gradually expanded.
