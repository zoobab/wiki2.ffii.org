''Warsaw, 18 February 2005 -- Minister of Science and Technology Michal Kleiber and Undersecretary of State Wlodzimierz Marcinski held a press conference about the new laws approved by Sejm (parliament) and about the informatisation of self-government. Minister Kleiber was asked about the state of software patents directive and government's vision for its future.''

Minister Michal '''Kleiber''' said that Europe needs a well drafted and widely supported directive. Reasonable discussion needs time and appropriate procedural frame. Poland welcomes and supports motion for restart unanimously approved by Conference of Presidents of European Parliament. This motion and several similar requests from parliaments of several european countries prove that Poland is no longer alone in its believe that issue of software patents should be regulated in more clear and precise way. Poland is happy that other countries replaced her as a requestor for delay in Council final decision. If there will be a motion for restart of political debate in Council Poland will be happy to second it./
