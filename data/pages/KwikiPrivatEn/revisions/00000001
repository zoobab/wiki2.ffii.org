= Sorry, the link that you were following is a private page  =

You were redirected to this page because you are not redirected, this is '''not''' the page you wanted to see.

To access this page, you have use your aktiv login, and you have to use the correct link:

The URL which has to be used to link to the page properly is http://kwiki.ffii.org/admin/<Kwikipagename>
where you replace <Kwikipagename> is the name of the page you want to access.

So, if you have a login (if not, we are sorry), you have to use the '''Back''' button of your browser,
and insert ''admin'' between the string kwiki.ffii.org and the <Kwikipagename>. All text which was
between them, e.g. ''index.cgi'' for example, has to be replaced by ''admin''.

(Sorry, after logging in you'll have to manually navigate to the private page you were looking for - we're going to improve this. 

To navigate, you could use the SiteMap or [Changes] links (found in the footer of every Wikipage) or you could type in an URL such as:
 http://kwiki.ffii.org/admin/JohnDoeEn
