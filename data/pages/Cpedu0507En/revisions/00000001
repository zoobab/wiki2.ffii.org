''The European Parliament has resisted a multi-million euro misinformation and lobbying campaign by a group of multinational firms and rejected an attempt by the united governmental patent bureaucracies and the European Commission to impose patents on pure software and business method on the EU member states.  It is now up to national parliaments, national judges and citizens to organise further resistance against the European Patent Organisation and the multinational corporations standing behind it, so as to make sure their harmful and illegal patent granting practise will not be followed in the jurisdictions of the member states.  The undersigned describe the problems and propose measures to address them.''
