After several complains from Lobby watch and some MEPs, the website of "Campaign for Creativity" has [[http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm|finally displayed the name of their financers]]. A version [[http://web.archive.org/web/20041027210658/campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm|archived by archive.org shows that this old page    ]] was not mentionning the name of their financers. The date of modification of the about page on the C4C website is prior to 22 mei 2005 01:13:45 - the date of the latest google cache ([[http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:JlMjZPjmc0IJ:campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm|Google cache of the page]]). The HTTP last mod is "Last modified: Mon, 16 May 2005 16:47:25 GMT".
