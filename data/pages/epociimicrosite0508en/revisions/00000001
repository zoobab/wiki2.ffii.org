''One month after the European parliament has rejected the proposed directive on "patentability of computer-implemented invention", best known as directiv on software patents, the European Patent Office has set up a microsite about the so-called-CII.''

== EPO "Microsite" ==

 * http://cii.european-patent-office.org/

"This microsite has been set up to provide information about
 * the law and practice under the European Patent Convention in the field of computer-implemented inventions
 * proposed legislative reforms in Europe in this field"

 * See also [http://cii.european-patent-office.org/_pdf/cii_brochure_en.pdf an associated brochure]

The first part of this microsite recalls the current legislation in Europe, recalling that Member States of the European Patent Organisation have harmonised national patent laws with the EPC, which prevent patenting of computer programs and business methods ''as such''. Nethertheless, it reaffirms current EPO doctrine to consider that some softwares can be considered to be ''not-as such'', given their technical character (without defining what "technical" means other by tautologism), and thus can be patented. It also claims that EPO do not grant patents on business methods, despite [:Wagner0409En: studies] and [http://webshop.ffii.org/ collected examples] that have proven the opposite.

EPO itself is repeating many of the [http://europarl.ffii.org/myths.en.html myths] which were denounced by FFII during the legislative process of the EU directive on software patents:

 * The alleged claim for harmonization was just a smoke screen, since almost every EU Member state (Malta is still an exception) has also signed the European Patent Convention (EPC), and has already harmonized its domestic patent law according to EPC.
 * The term "computer-implemented invention" relates to softwares.
 * The EPO's drift that has lead to grant patents on softwares and business methods is tied to an ideology reinterpreting the clear exclusion written down in EPC.

Then, there is a review of [http://swpat.ffii.org/log/intro/ failed attempts to legalize patenting of softwares in Europe]: first, the "Diplomatic Conference to revise the EPC", second, the "Proposed EU directive on the patentability of !CIIs".

Concerning the brochure, it reintroduces the same lie that EPO is not delivering patent on "pure" softwares, nor on business methods, giving the usual examples of ABS breaking system as an example of granted patent, which nobody contests, but failing to give any example of [http://gauss.ffii.org patents already granted on data processing].

Moreover, the brochure looks like a commercial ads praising "high quality and high legal certainty" of EPO's patents, invoking the anteriority search and the opposition procedures, while these are well-known to be insufficient. The brochure concludes on another myth: the benefits of patents for SMEs, while the [http://economic-majority.com Economic Majority] is claiming the opposite.

Gérald Sédrati-Dinet, FFII vice-president, pointed out:

  The objective of this "microsite" is unclear. It gathers informations,
  opinions and doctrines that are well-known to reflects the recent EPO
  practice to grant patent concerning softwares and business methods.
  This is exactly what was rejected both during the EPC Diplomatic
  Conference in 2000 and by the European Parliament on July 2005. This
  microsite is kind to recall in some short lines what has failed to be
  legalized. Maybe we can see this as a memorandum to keep tracks of
  a dead practice that has lived. As, warned by Rapporteur Rocard on the
  press conference that has followed the rejection of the directive:

  "European Patent Office has around 30,000 litigious patents --
  litigious, that is embodying software in the nature of the patent. By
  refusing this, we send a message to EPO: there is no more a majority
  to cover you, be carefull with your case law, it is clear, given the
  amazing awareness on this subject, that would this practice continue,
  a parlementary majority will arise to frame it, and even to forbid it,
  ineluctably and in a little while."  

== Some quotes ==

  According to a generally accepted and widely used definition, a
  computer-implemented invention (CII) is an invention whose
  implementation involves the use of a computer, computer network or
  other programmable apparatus, the invention having one or more
  features which are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer
  program.

  All the 31 member states of the European Patent Organisation have
  national patent laws whose basic provisions, in particular the
  patentability requirements, have been harmonised with the EPC.

  As with all inventions, computer-implemented inventions are only
  patentable if they:
    * have technical character and solve a technical problem,
    * are new and
    * provide an inventive technical contribution to the prior art.

  The European Patent Office (EPO) does not grant patents for computer
  programs or computer-implemented business methods that make no
  technical contribution. In this respect the granting practice of the
  EPO differs significantly from that of the United States Patent and
  Trademark Office (USPTO).

  Whilst the EPC sets out the patentability requirements of novelty,
  inventive step and industrial application in some detail (Article 54,
  Article 56 and Article 57 EPC), it does not contain a legal definition
  of the term "invention". It has, however, been part of the European
  legal tradition since the early days of the patent system that patent
  protection should be reserved for technical creations. The
  subject-matter of a patentable invention must therefore have a
  "technical character" or, to be more precise, involve a "technical
  teaching", that is an instruction addressed to a skilled person as to
  how to solve a particular technical problem using particular technical
  means.

  Although the EPC does not define the term "invention", it does contain
  a list of subject-matter and activities that are specifically excluded
  from patent protection on the grounds that they are not considered as
  having a technical character. The subject-matter and activities are
  listed in Article 52(2) EPC, which stipulates that they are not to be
  regarded as "inventions" within the meaning of European patent law.
  The list is not exhaustive but enumerates the major exclusions,
  including "methods for doing business" and "programs for computers".

  It should be emphasised that, under Article 52(3) EPC, these
  exceptions have to be interpreted narrowly. The subject-matter and
  activities on the list are only non-patentable if the European patent
  application or European patent relates to them as such. Therefore,
  inventions having a technical character which are or may be
  implemented by computer programs may well be patentable.

  The granting practice of the EPO and the case law of the boards of
  appeal (an independent body which reviews the decisions of the EPO in
  grant and opposition proceedings - see Article 106 EPC) are based on
  this interpretation of the term "invention".
  
  In June 1999 the member states of the European Patent Organisation
  gathered in Paris at an intergovernmental conference on the reform of
  the patent system in Europe. The mandate adopted by the Conference
  stated that "it is desirable to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the
  patentability of inventions involving software" and requested the
  Organisation to "prepare a revision conference to be convened in the
  year 2000 with a view to adopting a revised text relating in particular
  to Article 52(2) EPC" Article 52(2) EPC excludes computer programs as
  such from patentability.

  The Diplomatic Conference to revise the EPC took place in November
  2000. The patentability of computer programs was one of many revision
  points submitted to the Conference. It was proposed that programs for
  computers be deleted from the list in Article 52(2).

  The Conference however decided to leave Article 52(2) EPC unchanged.

  On 20 February 2002 the European Commission presented a proposal for
  a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.

  The recitals accompanying the proposal explain the background to the
  Commission's initiative:

    (1) "Effective, transparent and harmonised protection of
        computer-implemented inventions throughout the Member States
        is essential to maintain and encourage investment in this
        field.
    (2) Differences exist in the protection of computer-implemented
        inventions offered by the administrative practices and the
        case law of the Member States. Such differences could create
        barriers to trade and hence impede the proper functioning of
        the internal market.

  On 6 July 2005, the European Parliament, in the second reading,
  rejected the proposed directive by 648 votes to 14 with 18
  abstentions. This terminates the legislative procedure. The
  Commission has indicated that, for the time being, it does not
  intend to present a new proposal for legislation in this field.
