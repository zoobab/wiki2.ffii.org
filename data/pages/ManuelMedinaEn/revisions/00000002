''Manuel Medina is a member of the European Parliament for the Socialist Group (PSOE) during this and the last term.  In 2003, Medina was said to be leaning toward the pro-patent side, but during the vote he basically followed the compromise line of the Spanish socialists, supporting many cosmetic and some substantial amendments.  Recently, Medina has, in a news paper article, claimed that software patents have fostered innovation in the USA and that the EPO practice is very conservative.  Later, in amendments which he tabled for PSOE, he again clearly moved against software patentability.''
