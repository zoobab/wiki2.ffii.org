= Sony sued over image thumbnails patent =

The Register [[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/13/sony_sued/|reports]] that Sony is being sued by 
[[AmpexEn| Ampex]]
for violating "patents it holds for the storage and retrieval of digital images". Ampex is asking for a ban on importing of Sony PDA's and digital cameras in the US. Although the particular patents are not mentioned, a quick search turned up patent 
[[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US4821121|US4821121]].

Claim 1:

  1. An electronic still store system comprising: an image store means for retrievably storing therein a
    plurality of image frame copies of video frames, the image frame copies comprising data representing
    full spatial resolution images and corresponding data representing reduced spatial resolution images
    of the video frames; frame store means for receiving and storing in a first mode one of said full spatial
    resolution images from said image store means and for repetitively generating a full spatial resolution
    image output, and in a second mode for receiving from the image store means and storing a plurality
    of said reduced spatial resolution images each at selectively located different positions, the frame store
    means in the second mode further repetitively generating an image output comprising the stored
    plurality of said reduced spatial resolution images; and size reducer means for receiving from the
    frame store means the stored full spatial resolution image and in response thereto returning to the
    frame store means a corresponding reduced spatial resolution image, wherein the frame store means
    receives and stores the returned reduced spatial resolution image while continuing to store the stored
    full spatial resolution image.

Basically, it seems they've patented the concept of keeping thumbnails alongside full resolution images, and showing those thumbnails all together in one image. It's still valid till 2009. They also have a similar European Patent: [[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=EP0122094&QPN=EP0122094|EP0122094]]. However, it's only valid till 17 October 2004 at best (it was published in 1984).

Claim 1:

  1. An electronic still store system comprising:
     an image store (24) arranged for retrievably storing therein a plurality of frames of video images with
     both a full spatial resolution copy and a reduced spatial resolution copy of each image being stored; and
     a frame store (22) which is operable in a first mode to receive from the image store and repetitively
     generate a full spatial resolution output image frame and operable in a second mode to receive from
     the image store and store a plurality of reduced spatial resolution image frames, the frame store being
     further operable in the second mode to repetitively generate an output image frame having an image
     from each of the plurality of reduced spatial resolution image frames selectively located at a different
     position within the output image frame.
