The FFII is trying to mobilise its supporters to contact politicians and media to prevent the Council decision and/or get the Parliament's Restart project on track.  Supporters are also asked to support the campaign by web banners and/or strike pages.  This is being organised by the Webdemo Team (fish0501-help at ffii org).  In case you want to help, here are some entry points.  By its surprise tactic of inserting an A-item in the last minute, the Council/Commission of course makes this difficult.

== Addresses to Write To ==

 * [:FfiiMinistries0412En: Ministers of Agriculture & Fishery]

== Webdemo Organisation ==

 * [:FishDemoOrg0501En: The procedure for organizing this web demo/banner campaign:]

 * The FFII has covered its [http://www.ffii.org/index.en.html front page] with a letter to EU ministers of agriculture and is relaunching a [http://demo.ffii.org/cons0412/ webdemo and banner campaign of last December], in which it called on its supporters to help draw attention to the matter.

==  Find the latest banners at: ==

 * [http://demo.ffii.org/banner.html The ffii main webdemo banner page]

 * Some more images and additional stuff at the kwiki WebDemo page


== If you like to create a banner yourself: ==

   * You can use the fish images created by Anja Gerwinski:

http://demo.ffii.org/cons0501/fisch1.png, http://demo.ffii.org/cons0501/fisch2.png


   * Or the [http://plone.ffii.org/Members/mvernon/works/ Harmonization] sxd picture. You can just copy the object pieces.

   * Take fish pix from xfishtank


== To Do ==

 * blasum: write to all our supporters (not only german ones, but the german template can be used)
 * list pointers to people to whom supporters could write, with explanations.  These pointers should be listed on this page (FishDemo0501En).  Many already exist. 
 * translate/update the frontpage letters for various languages.  Do this by downloading the source from http://www.ffii.org/index.en.html or another language, editing it and sending it to fish0501-help at ffii org (installed in /var/www/adm/etc/aliases.src/)
