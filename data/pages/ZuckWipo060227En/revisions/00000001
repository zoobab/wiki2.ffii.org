  Open Forum on the draft Substantive Patent Law Treaty

  Dear Sir or Madam,
  
  you are organizing an Open Forum on the draft Substantive Patent Law
  Treaty (SPLT) on 1st of March.
  On your website [0], Mr. Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for
  Competitive Technology (ACT), is listed claiming to represent "The View
  of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises". We, a German SME initiative
  comprising more than 550 companies, strongly disagree with Mr. Zuck
  speaking on behalf of SMEs. Following his publications on software
  patents [1] and on open standards [2], as well as his involvement in
  defending Microsoft in the EU antitrust case [3], we are convinced that
  Mr. Zuck is in reality speaking for global players - especially
  Microsoft - and lobbies diametrically against the interests of SMEs.
  ACT's member list [4] showing names like eBay, Microsoft, Oracle or
  Verisign confirms our concerns.

  Therefore, we would urge you to not count on Mr. Zuck's words when it
  comes to SMEs and their view on Software Patents. There are
  organisations and institutions like CEA-PME or FFII, which are by far
  more representative on this topic.

  Yours Sincerely,
  
  Dirk Hillbrecht   Michael-Jordan Hrycaj Niclas Kser
  Dr. Nico Manicone Marco Schulze         Uwe Solleder
  Johannes Sommer
