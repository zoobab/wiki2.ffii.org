[ [:FfiiLtEn: FFII Lithuania] ]

== Saulius Grazulis reports: ==

On 2005.01.24 I have phoned Prof. Aloyzas Sakalas, Lithuanian MEP and member of 
JURY, and asked him to support the restart of the Computer Implemented 
directive. He sounded friendly and asked for the documents stating our position in english. I have forwarded him documents 'ffii-rationale.pdf' and 'kahin-rationale.pdf' from 
http://www.elis.ugent.be/~jmaebe/nobackup/restart05/. He has also received 
our former letters to the Lithuanian vice-minister signed by the scientific council of 
our the Institute of Biotechnology and a letter of AKL (Open Source Lithiania) organisation stating our concerns about the dangers of sw-pats.

He said that he needs some time to study the documents, and that he wants to 
have oppinion of the other side as well, and he will contact Lithuanian 
insdustry association for their oppinion as well.

I strongly hope that he will be persuaded by our logical arguments (he is a 
physicist, and physicists are trained to think logically :).

Apparently, he did not have complete information about the problems with software patents, and I hope that the information has reached him just in time.
