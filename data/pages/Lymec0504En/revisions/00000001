== Excerpt: Conclusion of LYMEC ==

The LYMEC Congress concludes that:
 * LYMEC urges the European Parliament to stand firm against the Council of Ministers in case the controversial political agreement of May 2004 is confirmed
 * The Bureau should on behalf of LYMEC contact Graham Watson MEP (Leader of the ALDE Group) to encourage him to call for all ALDE MEPs to vote against the patenting of software
 * LYMEC President should sign the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII)'s petition against software patents on behalf of LYMEC
 * LYMEC should join forces to FFII's campaign "Software Patents vs. Parliamentary Democracy".
