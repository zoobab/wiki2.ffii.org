Evaluation of the versions from Jonas and Hartmut:

Headline:
= Jonas: EU Democracy Undermined by Council =
= Harmut: MEPs and Software Creators Protest against Undermining of EU Democracy by Unelected Legislators =

Comments on Headline:
 * Jonas:
   * Correct lengh, possible to take as an article headline as well
   * Emphasizes on a Scandal (Scaldals take front pages)
   * short and sharp, without attacking persons, it's the body itself which is bad
 * Harmut:
   * too long for use article headline.
   * raises doubts like "Who are 'unelected legislators'?"
     * The national ministers in Germany are alos not elected, and they work on legislative texts like the council, so what gives?
   * people protest all the time, there is nothing new it it

Intro paragragraph:
 * Jonas:
   * Interesting 1st sentence which grabs attention,
   * EU not a democracy
