''Microsoft is reported to be inclined to build its European headquarter in Luxemburg after special efforts undertaken by Luxemburg's minister of economics Jean-Claude Krecké.  On March 7th Krecké, as president of the Council meeting on software patents, declared a position in favor of unlimited patentability to have been adopted, although there was no longer a majority for this position and several countries had demanded or were obliged to demand renegotiation.''

This is at least what an informant from Luxemburg tells us.  The background documents can be found at

We need some texts quoted and evaluated here.

There was also a nice newspaper advertisment "Buy an EU Law" on Luxemburg's Council lawmaking services.
