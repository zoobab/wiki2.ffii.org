This set of amendments was based on a year of work in the Parliament's committees for [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/juri0312/|Culture]] and [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/itre0312/|Industry]].  It was imposed against the will of the leading Legal Affairs Committee, whose leading figures [[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/amccarthy/|Arlene McCarthy]], [[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/jwuermeling/|Joachim Wuermeling]] and [[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/mharbour/|Malcolm Harbour]] had rejected the work of the other committees and, in close cooperation with the patent establishment, proposed a set of [[http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/juri0617/|fake limits on patentability]], which however did not succeed in deceiving fellow !MEPs in the plenary vote.
