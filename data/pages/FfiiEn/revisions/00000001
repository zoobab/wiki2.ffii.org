The link to Pending Patents is broken and should be replaced by http://gauss.ffii.org/Statistics/Pending/Applicantdesignatedcountry/

= A new addition to the "Sign Petition" page  =
 

 * Add a new field to input names of MEPs who the signatory has voted for in the last election.

 * Have signatories supply a freely formulated one line statement (ie. have people explain in their own words) why they (the signatories) oppose the software patent bill. 
 
Using that information, different petitions with voters' names and stated own respective opinions could then be sent to each MEP. 
Surely in the Social Darwinist world of politics the knowledge of their voters' opinion should be of great significance to supported MEPs.
