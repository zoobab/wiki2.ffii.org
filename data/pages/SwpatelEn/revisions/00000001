Mr. Sioufas is currently the greek minister of Development. He is affiliated with the party of New Democracy (Christian Democrats). At the time of this writing (2004-05-16) the main attention needs to be focused on him, since he is the one who will be voting in the Council of Ministers on behalf of Greece on Tuesday, 2004-5-17. 

In the voting of September 2003 of the European Parliament, the MEPs that represent New Democracy (the party of Mr. Sioufas), voted against software patents, stating clearly that they agree on putting strict limits on what should be patented. We hope that Mr. Sioufas will agree with his colleagues and vote against software patents, on the vote of the Council on Tuesday 2004-5-17.

The minister's decision is based on input from his advisors in the ministery, and in particular of Industrial Property Organisation (O.B.I. - which is a body of the ministery of Development too). Hopefully, fellow party members will manage to persuade him to vote against software patents, protecting this way the competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises, which powers mainly the Greek and European Informatics world.

It would be of great surprise and disappointment if Mr. Sioufas votes in favour of software patents, since he is known as a [http://news.antenna.gr/articleDetail/0,3091,82785,00.html very strong supporter] of innovation and competitiveness. In his recent speech at the Greek Parliament, he [http://www.parliament.gr/sioufas/prosklhsh_23_3_04.htm stated]:
"Competitiveness is the main precondition for development. But to succeed a high and viable competitiveness, it needs to be founded on the quality dimension of the prolific system". We hope he will remain strong to his ideas by voting against software patents.

== Industrial Property Organisation (OBI) ==

OBI is the body that advices the minster on the software patents issues. Although OBI is fully supporting patents (since it is the body that issues patents in Greece), we hope that they will agree with the minister's positions about spread of innovation and competitiveness of SMEs (small and medium enterprises), and oppose software patents. Since OBI had no meeting yet with the activists in Greece about software patents, and Greece being the home of democracy, all sides could be heard by asking at least a delay for his vote, so that Greece could decide on something that all greeks will agree.

== Frits Bolkestein ==

It is no secret that Mr. Bolkestein is a staunch supporter of software patents. He is the European Commissioner reponsible for "Internal Market" affairs and therefore wields a lot of influence. Frits Bolkestein recently announced that he would be resigning from his post as Commissioner this year. A more detailed profile on him can be read on [http://swpat.ffii.org/players/nl/index.en.html this older page].
