== About me ==

I have written a short [[FfiiKonvJmaebeCv0511En| "FFII CV"]] giving an overview of the things I have done in the FFII during the past years. In daily life I am a computer scientist working on my !PhD (on "intelligent instrumentation of computer programs").

== Why ==

Because I thought the FFII needed a new structure and new kind of leadership, which it now has (and it's not me, which is even better)!
