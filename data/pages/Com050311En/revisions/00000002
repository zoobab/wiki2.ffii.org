''11 March 2005 -- Commissioner'' !McCreevy ''has written a letter to Guiseppe Gargani, Chairmain of the EP's Legal Affairs Committee, about the Council's adoption of its "Common Position" and the Commission's views.''

The Commissioner notes, just like in his speech before the European Parliament earlier this week, that the ball is now in the camp of the European Parliament and that the Commission will not propose a new directive if the European Parliament rejects it. He also notes that "all modifications will have to be carefully evaluated due to the complexity of the subject matter". Nevertheless, he also implies that the Council may be the bigger nut to crack. Whether this is true remains to be seen, given the internal opposition within the Council.
