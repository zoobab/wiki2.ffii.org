= Awareness-Raising in London =

Nobody has so far volunteered to organise something before the 24th on the streets in London.

Otherwise please step forward, an info stand somewhere on the streets would be enough.  

FFII UK may be able to give limited logistic support, because Alex will be in Brussels.

Other activities are under way, and street activities are likely to happen later, when the proposal comes back
to the council and the UK Patent Office continues to abuse the gov't in its current way.

If you have somebody, ask swpparl039@ffii.org for the people which want to come!

Please add the contact information of the organisator here (edit button on the bottom of this page) if you have found someone.
Maybe some groups would help organise it:

Here is a list of Linux User Groups which might help: http://www.linux.org/groups/united_kingdom/england.html

The AFFS (fsfe-uk list) and the free-sklarov list could also be a place to get help.

Todo:

Contact organisations:
 * GLLUG - Greate London Linux User Group
 * London 2600 - Mailed twice, no response

Contacted:
 * ....?

Thanks!!!
