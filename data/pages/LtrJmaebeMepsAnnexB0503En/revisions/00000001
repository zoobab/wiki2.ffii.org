== Appendix A: The Case for reinstating the EP's first reading ==

A directive which effectively forbids software patents is of course the most desirable outcome. Although a European directive cannot influence the European Patent Office (EPO) directly, it does apply to the national courts where patents have to be enforced.

If software patents are unenforceable, people will be less inclined to ask for them and threats using such patents will be less interesting, given that the chance for them to be invalidated in a court case will be very high. The EPO has also already publicly stated it will comply with the directive, whatever the outcome. However, while stakes are high, so are the risks.

The arguments in favour of this approach are:

 * The Parliament has until now always sent strong and consistent signals regarding software patents. First the amendments of first reading, then the restart request (including a confirmation of this request in plenary) after it became clear the Council's Uncommon Position was leading nowhere.

 * Although second reading makes it more difficult for the EP to assert itself due to the "majority of component members" requirement, at the same time this means that all adopted amendments carry more weight. This is especially the case if similar amendments were also adopted in first reading.

 * The Council is internally divided, so is the Commission, and the latter has further weakened its position by not giving any substantial explanations for refusing the EP's restart request. If the Parliament clearly votes against software patents twice, it will be in a very strong negotiation position.

In such a situation, it may very well be possible to have the Conciliation procedure result in a clear and coherent text which can be supported by a majority in the EP's third reading. As such, if the Parliament believes it can achieve the necessary majorities for reinstating a text in the spirit of the outcome of the first reading, then this is definitely the way to go.
