(full name: Johanna Boogerd-Quaak)
Mrs. Boogerd is a MEP as part of a combined European liberal coalition of VVD (conservative-liberals) and D'66 (social-liberals). She is an outspoken '''opponent''' of software patents and is affiliated with D66, which makes her a fellow party member of minister Brinkhorst (see above). This should enable her to communicate with the minister easily and often.

She was unfortunately not re-elected in 2004.
