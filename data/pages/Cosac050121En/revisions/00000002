In response to the [[LtrCosac041216En| second COSAC letter]] sent by Vrijschrift and FFII, we received the following opinion of the [[http://libr.sejm.gov.pl/oide/index.php?topic=komisja_ue&id=main&col=1&newlang=english|Polish European Union Affairs Committee of the Lower Chamber of Parliament]]. They unambiguously condemn the political agreement reached in May and ask for renewed discussions. Unfortunately, the Council seems to be determined to push the proposal through on [[Fish0501En| Monday 24 January 2005]] anyway.

=== Text of the opinion ===
  
 Opinion no. 24
 of the European Union Affairs Committee 
 on the motion to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament
 and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions
 COM (2002) 92 and on the appropriate draft position of the Government 
 Adopted at the sitting on December, 17th 2004

 The European Union Affairs Committee strongly supports the Government
 in its intention to submit a statement related to the proposal for a directive
 of the European Parliament and of the  Council on the patentability of
 computer-implemented inventions COM (2002) 92. The Committee takes
 the position that the proposal for a directive in its present form should not
 be brought into effect.
