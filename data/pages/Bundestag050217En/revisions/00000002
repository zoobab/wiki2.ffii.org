''Berlin, 17 February 2005 -- Today the German Federal Parliament is scheduled to debate and adopt a cross-party motion against software patents.  The decision has already been postponed many times by the governing coalition so as to allow the Council's zombie "political agreement" of 18 May 2004 to be adopted first.  Meanwhile it has become impossible to delay further.  Stay tuned here to read about the debate.''
