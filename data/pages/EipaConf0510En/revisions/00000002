At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support the knowledge society.

Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world, particularly to stop internet piracy.

The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy, of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.

EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries, and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.

Dear Sir/Madam,

On 6 and 7 October 2005, the Luxembourg Antenna of the European Institute of Public Administration  the European Centre for Judges and Lawyers  is organising a seminar on 

Latest Developments in the Field of Intellectual Property

At the moment, intellectual property is a hot issue because of the Lisbon strategy, which emphasises economic growth, prosperity and employment and according to which innovation and dynamism in the EU should be stimulated and the functioning of the internal market and liberalisation of services should be developed in order to support the knowledge society.

Furthering the success of a knowledge-based economy therefore presupposes that the current body of EU law on intellectual property should be adapted to economic globalisation and to the digital world, particularly to stop internet piracy.

The effective implementation of this policy also presupposes harmonisation of criminal sanctions punishing counterfeiting or piracy, of substantive patent law and of the resolution of disputes relating to the counterfeiting and the validity of Community patents.
 
EU action will thus be optimised by, on the one hand, protecting its innovation and its market against counterfeiting by third countries, and, on the other hand, by working towards a redistribution of wealth to developing countries e.g. by strengthening its position as pioneer in ensuring access to affordable medicines for the poorest countries.
 

The seminar is aimed at lawyers, counsels in industrial property, representatives of national industrial property institutes or agencies, EU officials and national civil servants, professionals from the industry and research sector, academics and other professionals interested in intellectual property law.
