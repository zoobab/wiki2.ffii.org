''Programmed workflows of FFII should not be determined by the software we use.  Rather, the software should fulfill our specifications, and we need to configure or program it so that it does.  Here we try to specify what needs to be done.''

 * [[MlhtImportEn| /var/www/adm/bin/mlhtimport]] needs MIME decoding capabilities -- Perl module Mail::Message can be used, gilles at ffii org has shown how it works but his version of mlhtimport is currently outdated.  The failure of mlhtimport to handle MIME-encoded (quote-printable) texts is frustrating translation volunteers
 * need a new wiki which, in addition to being nicer to use than the present one, maintains essential features such as [[DokDataEn| exchanging document metadata with the database]] and [[KwikiEditEn| using FFII user id-s with crypt-ed passwords]].  Advanced preparations for implementing this on !MoinMoin have been undertaken by Jochen Wiedmann
 * [[UrlWatchEn| urlwatch]] system (started by Gilles) needs to be kept up to date and put into wider use
 * data synchronisation between mailman and the database, largely done by phm (Hartmut Pilch) in scripts such as ffiidb2mm and ffiimm2db, a better variant by Jochen Wiedmann is finished and nearly deployed, further maintenance and improvements may be needed.  It would be good if dedicated programmers could take over.
