''Reuters, like some other news agencies, has done a lousy job in reporting on the European software patent situation.  Their reports are poorly researched and often characterised by made-up arguments of both sides of the conflict, where the pro-patent side gets away very well.  Reuters has even signed an appeal in favor of software patents in Europe.''
