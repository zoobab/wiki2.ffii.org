== Seats  ==
 
||   CSV      ||  3   ||  (+1)  ||
||   LASP (Socialists)  ||  1  ||  (-1) ||
||   DP(Democrats)  ||  1  ||  (-0)  ||
||   Greens  ||  1  ||  (+0)  ||

Even though the greens gained 4% they did not get a second seat :(

For the greens it will be Claude Turmes as before.
We may have hope for Goebels to represent LSAP (good)
CSV will probably be Ms.Lulling (already in contact) and 2 new ones.
For DP Ms. POLFER Lydie is probable.

As Luxembourg had national elections too the people will be decided later.
