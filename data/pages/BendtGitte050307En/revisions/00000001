= A Good Day For Software Developers =

''Press release from the'' Konservative ''party, March 7, 2005, by Gitte Seeberg''

Today has been a good day for software developers. The European
software patent has come one step closer, is Gitte Seeberg's opinion.

"We should all be happy about the decision in EU's Council of
Ministers, even if the opposition in the Danish Parliament tried up
until the last minute to obstruct the process for all of Europe, says
Gitte Seeberg.

The Conservative member of the European Parliament makes her statement
in connection to today's majority decision by EU's Council of
Ministers about a common position on software patents.

"Software patents are absolutely necessary to protect in particular
small and medium sized enterprises, who would otherwise risk having
their good ideas and products copied by the large corporations with
far greater resources for development and marketing. That kind of
maverick state of affairs is of no help to the European software
industry", says Gitte Seeberg.

She is critical of the Danish Social Democrats and the left wing, who
have tried to derail the entire process.

"If the left wing had been successful in derailing the process, we
wouldn't have been able to introduce software patents for many
years. That would have been a setback for the European software
industry, and for the many jobs in this sector", says Gitte Seeberg.

She hopes that the Council of Ministers' proposal will get a positive
reception by the European Parliament, which is co-legislator on the issue.
