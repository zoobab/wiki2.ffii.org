== Warning: what the German justice ministry promised and what not ==

Hucko did say that Germany would oppose the Council's rush for an undiscussed decision.
This is good news, given that [:Slov040512En: german opposition seemed to have been withdrawn] before.
However it does not mean that the German government is against program claims or against any other of the scandalous provisions of the Council document.
Nor does it mean that the German government will spend great efforts to pull other governments on its side.
It means only that there are now more chances to have the Council decision postponed, not more and not less.

== Rough Translation of Heise news report ==

Wednesday evening Elmar Hucko, ministerial director at the German Ministry
of Justice, announced surprisingly on a demonstration of the FFII, that the
german government will vote against the controversial software patent directive
of the council of the Europan Union. Before, a message was circulating, that
Berlin paved the way for nodding off the councils proposal.

Under loud applause of the approximately 150 demonstrants in front of the
german ministry of justice in Berlin, Hucko puts straight, that "regarding
the contents, we are next to your position."

At the same time, Hucko excoriated the current allocation practice of the 
European Patent Office   in the domain of the controversial
"computer-implemented invention". "Not all of these patents
should have been granted", he pointed out.

"Under no circumstances we want the American situation in Europe", Hucko explained
in a view to the patent system in the USA. A patent should
stay a "reward for an earnest invention" and must not be abused
to "knock down on competition".

Christian Cornelssen of the FFII pointed out possible consequences of 
the guideline, which makes it not necessary anymore to execute a program in
order to infringe on a given patent. This would "not only be fatal for
open source" but also for many successful websites. The clause in article
52 of the European Patent Convention, which stated that a program "as such" 
must not fall under governmental monopoly protection, would then finally 
become void.

Markus Beckedahl, Member of the "Gruene Jugend" reminded of the fact that 
"three-quarters of the 30,000 illegaly issued patents in Europe do not 
originate from European companies" and thus the use for the European industry
is more than questionable. Finally Robert Leisner of attac condemned software 
patents, since they would represent nothing else then "another piece in the
mosaic towards aggreviated copyrights". Further demonstrations[1] took place 
in Munich, Lisbon and Vienna yesterday.
On today's Thursday, more events in Linz, Copenhagen and Madrid follow.
