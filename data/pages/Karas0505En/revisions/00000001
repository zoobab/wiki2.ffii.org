== Transcript ==


1. Mr. Rocard  16:45 to 17:05

 - French

2. Ms. Kauppi  17:05 to 17:18
 - seperate political and legal site of the debate
 - Legal: Parliament wants Status Quo - Patents now go to far
 - Political: Problems with wording (see amount of ammendments)
 - General, SME related:
   1. General patent system is very enterprise oriented (20.000/patent too much f. SME)
   2. SME must focus on work, not on patents
   3. Big industry would suffer  no outsourcing possible
   4. Court case opportunities: Not realistic to fight against big players (just blackmailing)
 - Conclusion: patents bad for SMEs in Europe, parliament should include SMEs

3. Mr. Mingorance  17:19 to 17:26
 - patents are in the hand of SMEs (detailed information will follow) 
 - patents enhance access  build business around SMEs
 - chance to improve patent system:
   1. more inclusive patent system
   2. accessable and cost-effective system
   3. -> patents are accessable to SMEs
 - protect innovation
 - chance that SMEs compete against international enterprises
 - suggestion: send strong political signal to harmonize between countries

4. Mr. Rocard  17:27 to 17:33
 - agrees to Mr. Mingorance, but not sufficient
 1. Request for clarification for legal zone of patents and copyright
 2. Ensure of legal protection is out of reach for SMEs 
 - copyright is competitable
 - technical aspects needs to be protected as well as all innovation
 - problem: border of technical aspect
