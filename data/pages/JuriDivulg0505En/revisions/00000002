== Article 3 (new paragraph) ==

||  number  ||  submitter  ||  recommendation  ||  text  ||

94 = 96 repeat a general principle of patent law.

== Article 6 a (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 158 | Gargani | - | The content of patent contracts must be shared by means of appropriate publicity arrangements. |

It is not clear what is meant by this amendment. Patent contracts fall outside the scope of this directive.

== Recital 17 a (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 239 | Kauppi | o | Member States shall ensure that the description shall disclose the invention as claimed in such terms that the technical solution can be understood, and state any advantageous effects of the invention with reference to the background art. |
| 240 | Lehne | - | Member States shall ensure that the description shall disclose the invention as claimed in such terms that the technical problem and its solution as well as the inventive step can be understood. |

239 is ok, but simply repeats a general principle of patent law.

240 refers to the EPO's problem-solution(-effects) approach, which as explained in comments to amendments 15 and 231-235 to recital 16 allows the EPO to consider pretty much everything done with a computer as "making a technical contribution".
