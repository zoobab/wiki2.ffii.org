Apparently, C4C doesn't like comments that are critical to the views it expresses. They have in fact [http://europeansoftwarepatents.blogspot.com/2005/07/fat-lady-sang-sweetly-personal-message.html disappeared]. Fortunately, [http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:pHsUMCO5fcUJ:europeansoftwarepatents.blogspot.com/2005/07/fat-lady-sang-sweetly-personal-message.html&hl=en Google cache still remembers them],  thus providing some evidence.
