A UK company bragging with an (apparently non-existent) patent GB 0410047.5 for what it refers to as a "software design methodology" and "mathematical solution", saying that such items are normally not patentable but in this case granted due to particular excellence of the solution.

 LONDON - Verum Consultants, the European start-up focussed on reducing
 errors in software, has been awarded patent protection in 170 countries
 for its Analytical Software Design (ASD) process. 

 Verum believes that the patent is groundbreaking as it is extremely rare
 for a software methodology to be granted patent protection. Typically
 patent agents regard software as an art form and intellectual property
 protection is limited to copyright. 

 Robert Howe, CEO at Verum, said, "The granting of patent protection to
 Verum's Analytical Software Design (ASD) demonstrates that it is not
 simply yet another voodoo methodology, but a credible mathematical
 solution to many of the problems that face architects and designers 
 charged with designing complex software systems." 

Nice that he says that they got their patent for a mathematical solution.
He moreover claims that such patents are not grantable, unless the
solution is so brilliant that the non-patentability rule can be broken.

The European Patent Office stresses in its introductory materials that
"a patent is not a certificate of technical excellence", apparently
because so many corporate press releases spread misinformation about the patent
system in efforts to make their company look more attractive to investors.  

FFII and others have been [http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/inflation/ arguing]
that the patentability of mathematical solutions is due to an erosion of quality
requirements in the patent system.  Most of the
mathematical solutions granted by patent offices are in fact
[http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trivial/ trivial].

On the patent itself, the PR discloses the following:  

 Verum's patent (Number GB 0410047.5) covers the Analytical Software
 Design Technology (ASD) process, whereby informal specifications are
 converted to CSP models. It also covers the mathematical bridge between 
 Sequence Based Specification (SBS) and Box Structured Development Method
 (BSDM) elements of ASD and CSP, and the modifications that Verum has
 made to SBS and BSDM to make this bridge possible. 

A research on http://gb.espacenet.com/ showed that the patent does not seem to exist yet.
Steve Probert, Deputy Director in the UK patent office, confirmed this in a public mailing list discussion.

Further research shows that the patentees are involved in a "technology transfer" from public-funded research to a patent business.

Section 110 of the UK Patents Act 1977 reads as follows:

110.- (1) If a person falsely represents that anything disposed of by him for value is a  patented product he shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

Hartmut Pilch has written to the EETUK journalist to ask for clarification and has not received a reply yet.

It would probably be better for someone to write to Verum.com directly.
