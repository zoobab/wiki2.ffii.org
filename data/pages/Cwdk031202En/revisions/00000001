ComputerWorld.dk has published an article which treats the patent
issue as one of free vs proprietary software and in general argues
along lines which resemble those of the SCO PR department:

The story originated from the fact that three small Danish software companies
- Kapow, ConfigIt and PremitTech - had been granted a meeting with the
Committee on Europe in the Danish parlament to complain about the European
Parliament's amendments to the proposed software patent directive.

The following week both Danish it-industry organisations,
IT-Brancheforeningen and ITEK, came out very strongly in support of
these companies, with very strong warnings about the EP-changes.

On a danish mailing list the following was dug out:

  "Danish Internet Ventures" is a Kapow Investor:

  Klaus Holse Andersen came to MS Denmark in 2001 as CEO. He's earlier been
  CEO of Internet Ventures.

  Premitech seems to have close ties to MS as well:

  "Chairman of the Board: Klaus Holse Andersen Mr. Klaus Holse Andersen is
  the EMEA Vice president of Microsoft. Klaus Holse Andersen has held Danish
  as well as international top management positions within large software
  corporations such as Oracle and Microsoft. He is the former CEO of
  LicEnergy, a European software company, and the former CEO of venture
  capital company IVS in Denmark. Klaus Holse Andersen also serves as Board
  Member in a number of IT companies."

  ConfigIT is also somewhat connected to MS:

  "I am currently on leave, visiting Microsoft Research in Redmond, Seattle.
  Here I am a part of the Software Productivity Tools group and work on the
  SLAM project. ... I am a co-founder of the IT company ConfigIt Software."

  They had a capital infusion recently (2002?) - dunno by whom though.

No decent conspiracy theorist would need more than that ;-)

So far the three companies have not explained in public any examples
of the precious "intellectual property" which they believe will lack 
"protection" or be "stolen" if they do not obtain software patents.
