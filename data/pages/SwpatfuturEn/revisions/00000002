''What will happen next in with Regard to Software Patents, in particular the EU directive project?  What is up in India, Australia? at WIPO, WSIS?  FFII & friends try to keep this page up to date.''

== Software patents, as a back door in the Community Patent Directive? ==

After failing to push through software patents with the CII-directive, using EPO-newspeak, the commission has reawakened the community patent directive. This now comes with a a dangerous twist: That the new court should use the EPO-praxis on software patents.

=== Council ===

The [[Cons040518En| software patent agreement of 2004-05-18]] did no longer enjoy the support of a legitimated majority of governments, but it has been pushed thru the Council nevertheless.  The FFII asked [[LtrFfiiCons050308En| 23 Questions]], to which one member received a written response which did not answer them and thereby only strengthened the impression of illegality.  [[Eu0307En| Investigation and Commemoration of the Council's Adoption Farce of 2005-03-07]] will have to continue.

== USA ==

 * Patent reform act in Congress (little impact on subject matter, mainly procedural issues)

== Indian Government Ordinance ==

Change with regard to software patents stopped for the time being, but granting of software patents in India not stopped.

 * Nath0412En
 * SwpatinEn

== Australia-USA Free Trade Agreement ==

The AUSFTA will be used to push the limits of patentability or to legitimate caselaw created by the patent judiciary.
