AIPPI newsletter: "Q132 had to deal with recent developments in the European Parliament concerning the Draft Directive for the protection of computer implemented inventions. The Open Source movement and other circles had managed to bring amendments into the discussion which limit the protection of computer implemented inventions to a level which falls even below the present standard of the EPO. The Resolution adopted urges the European Parliament not to accept the suggested amendments but to continue to work on the Draft Directive to ensure that computer implemented inventions are treated equally compared to inventions in other fields of technology and that the criteria for patentability are strictly applied." http://www.aippi.org/Newsletter/Newsletter1_04.pdf

Mr. Alberto BERCOVITZ
Chairman of the Session

Mr. Gustavo LEONARDOS (Brazil). Point 5 of the Resolution seems to imply that the principle of
free speech does not apply to the use of trademarks in parody. Perhaps it is just a matter of substi-
tuting the word "should" by "may" or "could".
Mr. BOCHNOVIC. The principle of freedom of speech is so fundamental that no AIPPI Resolution
or trademark law would be able to erode it. I suggest leaving it out of the Resolution. Mr. LEO-
NARDOS (Brazil) withdraws his proposal.
