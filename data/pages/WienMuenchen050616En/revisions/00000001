In a joint letter to the Members of the European Parliament the heads of Vienna and Munich do point out that:

 in particular, the technical contribution to an invention is inadequately defined [in the 
 Council common position], i.e. the wide range of interpretations could allow for broad 
 patentability of software at large. This would amount to an enormous element for us, and 
 especially small and medium-sized enterprises that develop or customize software for us 
 and many other European public administrations. As a result, the costs and risks of 
 software development, both free and proprietary software, are likely to in increase.
