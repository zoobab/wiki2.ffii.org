They claim that the Council's approach limits patentability to processes characterised by peripheral hardware and excludes patenting of office software.

In an oral statement, Mme Haignere even said that "Windows software" was not to be patentable.

Yet the Commission's own press release and many other papers state that the purpose of the Council paper is to codify the illegitimate practice of the European Patent Office, which, as is well known, has granted not only many patents that cover text processing algorithms but also many patents that cover business methods.

It is also clear from the Council text that this practice is fully endorsed and in no way limited.

They have been informed about the promises of President Chirac, which they broke, see
