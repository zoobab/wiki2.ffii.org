''In early May it became apparent to a large public that some Microsoft Windows programs could not be brought to run on Linux because of a patent held by Borland, which affects the Windows Emulator (Wine) and GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).  Borland's Chief Scientist Danny Thorpe began a public dialog.  Although Thorpe repeated Borland's traditional attitude that patents "suck" and are collected for defensive purposes only, the problem appeared difficult to solve.''

== Salient Quotes ==

From the [http://blogs.borland.com/dcc/archive/2005/05/12/4294.aspx original weblog article of Borland's chief scientist Danny Thorpe and reader feedback]:

Danny Thorpe (Borland):

   Patents suck, sure, but it's the system that we're given.

   If you're seeking reassurance that some artifact won't be used to
   sabotage a project, just ring the doorbell and ask. 

Steven Edwards:

   I asked Borland about this years ago and I was told a rough estimate
   on licensing costs that was far beyond what any free software project
   could pay.

Hubert Lepicki:

   Well, you say that "patents suck". I agree. But what Borland should do
   about this? Maybe you guys should consider changing your patent policy
   - first of all - open your patents for open source projects, and then
   - lobby __against__ software patents.

Gerasimos Melissaratos:

   I believe IBM has a publicly stated policy (I think it's
   "we won't sue if it's used in an OSS project").
   What is Borland's policy? Should every OSS developer who wants to use
   a Borland patented technique go and ring the bell?

== More about the Wine case ==

Similar patents have been granted to Borland in Europe and will be difficult to attack once the EU Council's draft is accepted without substantial amendments.  Please read the [:Wine05En: FFII documentation].
