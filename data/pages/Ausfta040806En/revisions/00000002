== Outline ==

Some software groups, including Linux Australia, have submitted position papers criticising provisions in the
signed (but not yet ratified) "Australia US Free Trade Agreement" (AUSFTA) which oblige Australia to perpetuate IP-extremist judicial practises
in present-day US and AU patent and copyright caselaw.   While some scholars, senior diplomats and media have heavily blasted the AUSFTA agreement, alleging that it is about erecting non-tarifary barriers in favor of certain US businesses, the AU government is pushing for ratification of the AUSFTA and has replied that the concerns are unfounded.  A press release of the ICT ministry says that AUSFTA only confirms current patent office practise.
