here is a working URL to Widenius contribution:

http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/widenius.pdf

note: FfiiKonsultEn

and it is probably better worded Widenius00xxxxEn where a link is given to the consultation mentioned and a information page about Widenius: MichaelWideniusEn

The first note above was added to the addenda page of http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eukonsult00/widenius/index.en.html (which is this page)
where the links to Widenius submission to the hearing are broken. The correct fix would have been to correct the broken URLs, not making a new kwiki-structure.
