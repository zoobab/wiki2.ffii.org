''On 21-24 February Internal Market commissioner Charlie Mccreevy was in Strasburg to speak with members of the European Parliament, mainly on the service directive.  FFII activists drafted some questions to be put to him.''

== Draft Questions ==

 * Last 10 february, the Dutch parliament has asked the Dutch government to prevent an A-item to be put on the agenda of the Council before the Commission answers Parliament request to restart. Will the Commission answer the European Parliament's request **before** this directive will be put on the Council agenda? (Y/N/ABS) And how many days before? (xx days)
 * In 2001, Microsoft Ireland was representing approximately 10% of the total of corporate taxes in Ireland. This company was also official sponsor of the Irish Presidency. (Q1) What is your personal relation with representatives of this company? Can you claim being independant of any influence from this company with such high percentage of participation in the Irish economy, especially on the software patent directive? (Q2) Do you think software patents, that are monopolies granted for 20 years, will strengthen the monopoly of this company? Y/N/ABS (Q3) Do you think antitrust rules and procedures are fast enough for SMEs, which represents 80% of jobs in the european ICT sector?
