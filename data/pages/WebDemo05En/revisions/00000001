''The European Parliament is the latest piece of democracy in the European system, and this Parliament is currently under heavy lobbying of software multinationals. Those ones are currently lobbying hard to weaken the amendments of the first reading of september 2003, which has drawn clear limits to what and what was not patentable. From the speech of Rocard last 21 april in the JURI comitee, "I have received more then 27 (!) members of the big industry for the last 20 days"! (modify this).''
