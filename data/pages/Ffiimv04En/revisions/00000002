Some miscellenea that could be discussed at FFII Membership assembly


(this page is world-editable, it is for brain-storming, not for cooking up a binding agenda)


= Website diversification =

Rebentisch: Would like to get my own domain and a LAMP server and set up a swpat portal as there is so many news and a blogger (useful for the conference)
say http://swpatnews.de We shall also further diversify and create additional websites as FFII -main site is often a showstopper that excludes contributors from participation and Harmut Pilch is overloaded.
I would also like to set up a FFII site on which software future projects are presented, real '''innovation''' such as Askemos, segusoland, grid computing etc.

= FFII Logo =

Rebentisch: We need a new logo for professional appearence, I made some experiemental proposal with an old ULead cool 3D 2.0 tool, I own a license.

http://plone.ffii.org/prmat/FFII%20LOGO/folder_contents

Logo is important because:

 * core team needs business cards for conferences

 * FFII letter

 * FFII PR mat investments

 * outer appearence

Osfield(UK) would prefer another FFII-Logo direction: "it just gets across what the letters of the name are.  Things that spring to mind are trying to convey the concept of freedom of information, an open book, an open mind, collaboration, shaking hands, breaking chains."


= How to manage multi-national structure =

 * Holger or others: legal structure
 * FFII uk, pl ---> Why not: FFII.nl? FFII.it? FFII.fr ecc.
 * how to crawl transatlantic: US campaign ecc.

= Accred. =
 * Accreditation issues to international orgs
