= We still need to send the appeal to various persons in the Ministry, to the Head of the Parliament, to the party leaders, and others. If you can help, please contact Antonios Christofides, anthony@itia.ntua.gr. =

== Appeal delivered to Government  ==
The letter was delivered by Antonios Christofides to the Minister's office, in the morning of 20/7/2004. The document delivered can be found at http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf (in Greek, of course). It was delivered together with a short cover letter. The people responsible for the incoming documents said the Minister, Mr. Sioufas, reads all of them and assigns them to others; they advised to call after a week in order to learn which person it will have been assigned to.

In the evening of that same day, a press release was issued by the Greek team. The Greek version of it is at http://epatents.hellug.gr/pages/pr_2004-07-20/. A quick-and-dirty English translation follows.

Until now, the appeal has been delivered to:

=== Minister of Development of Greece ===
  Minister of Development Mr. Sioufas
  Mesogion 119
  10192 Athens
  Greece

Delivered personally to Minister's Office, 20 Jul 2004, and got reference number 4143/20-7-2004. Called on 2 September 2004 (the Registry of the Minister's office phone number is +30-2106974722) and were told that the document has been given to the General Secretariat of Industry (Geniki Grammateia Biomichanias).

=== Prime Minister of Greece ===
  Prime Minister Mr. Konstantinos Karamanlis
  Megaro Maximou
  Irodou Attikou 19
  10674 Athens
  Greece

Posted on 23 Jul 2004. The main reason for sending to the PM was because the cover letter of the Appeal sent to the Minister of Development said we were CC'ing the PM; we did this to give more weight, rather because we think the PM office would pay any attention at all.

=== Minister of Commerce of Cyprus ===
  Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Mr. Yiorgos Lillikas
  Andrea Araouzou 6
  1421 Lefkosia
  Cyprus

Posted on 1 Sep 2004. The cover letter, besides the Minister, also mentions the Permanent Secretary, Sotiris Sotiriou, as intended recipient.

== Greek Press Release, 20 Jul 2004, poorly translated ==

A document delivered today by FFII representatives to the Minister of
Development, Mr Sioufas, makes disclosures about deceit of the Ministers of
the EU. The document, an appeal signed by companies and organizations,
available from http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf, provides
specific evidence of deceit and surprise tactics used to fool the
ministerial officials during the Council meeting of 18 May 2004 concerning the
infamous software patent directive.

Attempts by European patent offices and large multinational corporations to
legalise software patents, despite being forbidden by Article 52 of the
European Patent Convention, have been going on for years, but have met strong
resistance. Even the Commission, who had proposed to legalise software patents
two years ago, today claim to be against software patents, as Commissioner
Bolkestein said during the Council meeting of 18 May. The economic studies and
the experience from USA and Japan, where software patents are allowed, clearly
indicate catastrophic consequences in innovation and in the economic
development of the information-based society; as a result, Europe is
unanimously opposed to software patents. Nevertheless, the text adopted by the
Council ensures the opposite of what the European Parliament, the Ministers and
the Commission claim they want. This is achieved by means of vague points,
contradictions, and clever devices of the form "software is not patentable,
unless [:complex :condition that after close scrutiny proves to always be true]".

The delivery of the appeal to the Minister came soon after a demonstration that
had been organised by the Greek team against software patents last Friday at
Stournara street, Athens. More than a hundred persons participated, leaflets
were distributed, banners and ballons were used to inform passers-by, while the
details about the delivery of the appeal were discussed. Photographs from the
demonstration are available at http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/st04photos/.

The appeal, which will soon be delivered to the other ministers of the EU, asks
to revoke the decision of 18 May, something that is possible because the
decision is merely a political agreement, and the final adoption is scheduled
for the next Council meeting expected in September 2004. The Dutch Parliament
had also issued a similar demand on 1 July (see older press release mentioned
in the references).

Dimitris Glezos, FFII representative in Greece, comments: "It is important to
study the events of 18 May deeply so that similar catastrophes are avoided in
the future. The software patent issue concerns many people who closely monitor
the news, and who naturally learned what happened at the Council meeting."
Concerning the Greek representatives he commented that "it is up to our
representatives to prove that they decide what they vote and not others, even
more so for such an important issue as software patents."
