OBSOLETE PAGE.  Please do not add news to this page.  Our official software patent news page has moved to http://press.ffii.org/Software_patent_news.  Please add new items there and update your bookmarks and RSS feeds.

## Please [:KwikiEditEn: become an editor] and add news (e.g. [http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&q=%22community+patent%22+OR+%22software+patent%22+OR+%22computer+implemented+inventions%22&btnG=Search+News from Google News] or [http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=Patent+OR+Wipo+OR+Patents&btnG=Search+Blogs Blogsearch] or [http://www.iusmentis.com/news/ Moreover]  or [http://www.ipnewsflash.com/ IPNewsflash]) to the top according to the [:SwpatcninoMetaEn: rules]!

## Only add entries to the top, never sort this page because people read this page like a web log, from top to the first news which they have read already. If someone needs a chronologically sorted version, it needs to be automatically generated from this page like the RSS stream is created.  

## phm: Add (-> [:PageEn: background page]) after external links only! Internally linked pages should contain the link to the background document in their own head part

## When the page has more than 20 items that are from FFII itself, move stuff from the end to a month's collection such as Swpatcnino0412En

## Prepending "http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A//" to a url makes sure it doesn't count for Google's pagerank. Please do this for rubbish such as C4C pages.

## PLEASE don't add comments to news on this page when the news item has a page of its own (e.g. "meanwhile denied by Luxemburg presidency").  This page is not a billboard for all kinds of info exchanges, and such a comment removes our PR from the RSS system.

## General remark: names of countries and languages are written with a CAPITAL in English.

## This page is generally for English news (unless it's really breaking news only available in another language). You can of course always create an English language wiki page with a summary of a foreign language text and link to that from SwpatcninoEn (that's even very much encouraged!)
## FT.com: Papers are for subscribers only: normally the whole text is available via "Print" nonetheless, one could post therefore the direct link for this "Print" version, but this MB questionable .. e.g. [http://news.ft.com/cms/s/4de5db4e-942e-11d9-9d6e-00000e2511c8,ft_acl=,s01=2.html#] or directly [http://news.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F4de5db4e-942e-11d9-9d6e-00000e2511c8%2Cft_acl%3D%2Cs01%3D1.html&partnerID=1744] for message from below [FT: Ericsson boss - "major, ... ] Please, don't spread this information too amply ...!
## please do not post links to pure astroturfing articles like this (this guy is paid to write lies like that). They don't contain any useful information at all... You can optionally create a rebuttal wiki page, link that from the news and link the story from there, but I don't think it's worth wasting your energy on that (jmaebe)
