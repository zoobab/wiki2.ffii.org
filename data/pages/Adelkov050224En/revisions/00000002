''The Danish government is coming under increased pressure to remove its support for the EU Council's software patent directive agreement of last May.  The Social Democrats, on whose support the governing coalition depends, are asking for adoption of a cross-party resolution in the style of the German Parliament and for a pledge by the government not to allow adoption of the Agreement as an A-item.''

Several [[http://www.computerworld.dk/default.asp?Mode=2&ArticleID=27184|danish]] [[http://www.comon.dk/index.php/news/show/id=21263|media]] carry statements made by Thomas Adelskov, IT spokesman of the [[http://wiki.ffii.org/DkSocDemEn|danish Social Democrats]] to the [[http://www.ritzau.dk|Ritzau news agency]]

A swing vote in the danish software patent struggle, the opposition party wants the council decision postponed. Instead the government should pursue a german amendment proposal.

== Quotes from Adelskov (danish version below) ==

"We think so many people have pointed out problems in the proposal that we ask the government that no decisions be made in the EU on a software patent directive right now."

"Several other EU countries have taken the position we have now. This will hopefully mean that we postpone the decision, and in its place have the more thourough discussion necessary."

== Quotes in Danish ==

"Vi synes, der har været så mange, der har påpeget problemer i forslaget, at vi vil bede regeringen om, at der i EU ikke bliver truffet beslutning om, at der laves er softwarepatentdirektiv lige nu,"

"Flere andre lande i EU har indtaget samme standpunkt, som vi har nu. Det får forhåbentlig den betydning, at vi nu udskyder beslutningen, og i stedet tager den grundigere diskussion, der er nødvendig"
