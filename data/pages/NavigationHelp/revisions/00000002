= How to navigate the FFII commenting system =

 * Use the '''Changes''' function to find out which pages have been edited lately.
 * The SiteMap function lists all pages in alphabetical order
 * The '''Search''' box let's you search the full text of kwiki pages for a given term. (Search has been temporarily disabled while our server is under extremely heavy load)

== How to create a new page ==
You would like to create a new page that is not attached to a static FFII page?

Decide on its name (for example MyIndependentPage) and '''just use the name''' in an existing page that you are editing. You will have created a link to your new page. Your new page is of course still empty - you can now click its Edit button and add some text. It works like this in every Wiki and the concept is so simple that sometimes it is hard to grasp by computer geeks.
