THIS IS OUTDATED. See http:SwpatcninoEn for 7 March A-item news.

----
Dear FFII supporter,

on Thursday evening a supporter has received an email of
Kuenast (German minister of agriculture) assistant saying "I
am writing on behalf of Renate Kuenast. On February 28th the
'Common Position' will be formally confirmed on a meeting of
the Agriculture and Fishery Ministers." If one wants to nod
through an A-Item, the Monday date would have been selected
diligently: !MEPs are on their way from a Strasbourg session
back to Brussels and - that might be the scheme - over the
weekend mobilization might be more difficult.

Immediate action is thus recommended, hence we are sending
out this email since night and ask you to use your politcial
contacts to ensure that the software patent directive is no
A-item on 28 February. On the other hand immediate action also
implies that we have not been able to verify that email from a
second source, and ask your for verification or falsification,
most recent results are published at

http://wiki.ffii.org/AItemWarning050224En ![:this :Wiki, section "Intelligence"]

(we would ask you to check there after opening ths mail and
add the result of your own inquiries.)

With kind regards,
