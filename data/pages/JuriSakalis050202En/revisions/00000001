Sakalis:

Thank you, Mr Chairman!

It might be known, Mr Commissioner, that scientists of universities and managers of small and medium enterprises raised the alarm after the so-named Political Agreement was adopted in the Council on software patents.

Why has the commission overlooked the viabilities and uncertainity ... patents?
When has the commission assessed the exposures of Europe's public agencies and ... using companies to the claims of patent infringement?

In my opinion, the best solution at the given time would to withdraw this proposal and favor a revised one. 

What are you opinions on this? Thankyou.
