 * Brussels, 12 April: Commission consultation on EU patent strategy closed. FFII submitted response to questionnaire, endorsed by numerous firms and individuals. 


Details

In January 2006, the European Commission started a consultation on a project that, if it goes according to current plans, will result in the legalization of software patents, which are known to be devastating to the software industry. The project is the Community Patent. While the essential idea, having EU-wide patents, is a good one, the current Commission proposal would transfer EU and member state legislative and judicial power to the European Patent Office, which would effectively legalize their hitherto illegal practice of granting software patents. Moreover, patent system do not guarantee continued innovation. In the context of free market, its expansion appears clearly counterproductive.

FFII first questioned the validity of the procedure, based on the serious lack of accessibility, which means that a majority of EU businesses are completely excluded from answering. 
Thats why FFII recommended participation to those businesses that are able to do so, since this will demonstrate to what extent businesses are affected. For Open democracy means more transparency and effective hearings of all stakeholders 

Following a formal complaint by FFII to the EU Commission's President Barroso, and meetings between FFII and the Commission, the Commission has agreed to extend its deadline from 31 March 2006 to 12 April 2006.
FFII submitted its answer to the consultation organized by the European Commission on the Future of the Patent Policy in Europe last Wednesday 12th of April.
