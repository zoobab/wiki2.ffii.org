== "The da Vinci Code" story and its similarity with Software Patents ==

This story appeared in English and Spanish press:

 * 2006-03-28 UK [http://iht.com/articles/2006/02/27/news/london.php International Herald Tribune: 'The Da Vinci Code' taken to High Court]
 * 2006-02-27 UK [http://www.elpais.es/articulo/elpporcul/20060227elpepucul_2/Tes/cultura/Juicio/plagio/%E2%80%98El/codigo/Da/Vinci%E2%80%99 El País: Juicio por plagio contra 'El Código da Vinci']

But what it is interesting of it is:

 *1) The investigators that sue to Dan Brown claim that they have spend a
 lot of years of studies to get the results they got.

 *2) The investigators claim that Dan Brown has stolen and got profit from
 their ideas and that he has to pay for this.

 *3) The investigators try to focus their accusation in the '''copyright'''
 law, so in the expression of the ideas instead of in the physical
 implementation of them (patent law).

So: the investigators aren't using the patent law no matter if what they
claim to have been stolen is their ideas product of a lot of years and
years of costly investment.

 Doubt1: Why in software "same kind of investigators" should be able to
 sue (and win) using patent law and in literature not? At the end the
 mental effort (not empirical) and the investment can be exactly the same
 in both cases, isn't it?

 Doubt2: Why SwPats are needed to get innovation in software and they
 never were needed to get innovation in literature?

 Doubt3: Isn't software development a mental act in the same way as
 literature, maths, physics and other theoretic sciences?

----
Conclusion:
 *    SOFTWARE PATENTS = literature patents = MONOPOLIES OF IDEAS
