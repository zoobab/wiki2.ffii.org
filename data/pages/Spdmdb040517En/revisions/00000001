 * [http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/47426 heise: Softwarepatentlinie des EU-Rats weiter unter Beschuss]

The social democratic party's media and internet affairs expert Joerg Tauss, head of the subcomittee on New Media of the German Federal Parliament and in charge of science and education, as well as his colleague Ulrich Kelber, in charge of internet security questions, published a press release and an interview in which they express support for the European Parliament's amendments and point out that these amendments help solve serious problems that patents as granted by the European Patent Office pose for the information society and network security, whereas the Couuncil is failing to address these problems.  They request that the Council proposal be refused and sent back for further study.
