 * phm is participating i a two day conference at Turin Polititechnical University on IP & Knowledge Society
   * venue: Fondazione Agnelli, Via Giacosa 38 (Agnelli family --> Fiat)
   * [[http://cyberlaw.ieiit.cnr.it/|full program]]
 * the university in this industrial center of Italy has produced many studies that show  how innovation and scientific progress are increasingly unlikely to benefit from the patent system.
   * these studies were laid out at the conference table
   * language of the studies and the conference is Italian, phm's presentation is also in Italian
   * an interdisciplinary group of researchers has grown and created a center of competence on "IP" matters that acts as a counter-weight to the usual simplistic IP propaganda and has an influence on politicians
   * politicians and diplomats, some of whom represent IT in Consilium, are present
   * it appears that Italy s efforts to counter the patent lobby in the Council are deep rooted, but so far the diplomats often feel weak and discouraged in face of an overwhelming majority of patent believers from other countries
