''3rd May 2005 -- Christian Ude, mayor of Munich, criticises the European Commission and the German government for their intransigence regarding software patents.''

An article published by the Munich city administration cites Ude as saying: "The European Commission could have stepped onto the golden bridge built by the European Parliament, but instead tries to affront the Parliament and all critics." 

The article goes on: "Hence it is now to the EU Council of Ministers to start a renewed discussion on the topic on a council level and to avoid the clash of EU Commission and Parliament. At the end this is about fruitful discussion and not about a power fight."

Ude is cited again: "The best way out of this rare confrontation is for the German government to ask for a reopening of negotiations in the Council."
