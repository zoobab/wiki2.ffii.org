The statements are listed in increasing order of determinedness.

 * Hungary: ConsUniHu0412En (Happy with the directive. No mention of patentability of software. Emphasis on SMEs needs. No goals in second reading stated.)

 * France: ConsUniFr0412En (Happy with the text, some parts are open to conflicting interpretations, will be careful in implementation)

 * Latvia: ConsUniLv0412En (Exclude software and business methods. SMEs concerns. In the future seeks balance.)

 * The Netherlands: ConsUniNl0412En (Exclude software and business methods. Political pressure mentioned. In the future seeks balance.

 * Belgium: ConsUniBe0412En (Interoperability is not provided, the text is not good yet, abstain)
