= The public hearing on the future patent policy in Europe (Brussels, 12 July 2006) =

----

Here is the draft agenda of the public hearing on the future patent policy in Europe to be held on the 12th July 2006. The European Commission (EC) will first present a document outlining the preliminary findings of the consultation based on replies received until 12 April 2006. Then, the Internal Market DG will directly consult stakeholders on their needs in relation to the legal framework and possible actions in the field of industrial property. The EC 39 selected stakeholders are supposed to "represent the balance of opinion in the written replies will speak on the issues raised" during the hearing. As you will see, patents proponents are mainly represented. There will also be time for an "open debate" and a presentation from the president of the European Patent Office (EPO), professor Alain Pompidou.

consultation on future patent policy in Europe. In its submission, 
ECIS advocates a patent policy that is based on the fostering of competition 
and innovation for the benefit of consumers, accomplished by ensuring
appropriate standards of patentability and examination, as well as 
by appreciating the important role played by interoperability. ECIS also urged
the Commission to ensure adequate safeguards against misuse of the patent system. 
The greatest threat to an effective and credible patent system that serves all 
interests is the use of the patent system in a manner that subverts it, 
for example, by allowing entities to accumulate patents for the mere purpose
of extricating royalties by threatening to stop the commercialisation of a 
product utilising the patent, without the entities implementing the patented 
technologies themselves, by using patents to prevent interoperability with 
dominant products or platforms, or by late disclosure of standards-related patents.

In addition, language barriers pose a huge problem. A simplified regime must be adopted".

=== Public hearing next 12 July - European Commission strikes back ===


Software are not patentable in Europe, in despite of the European
Patent Office practices and the attempt by the European Commission
to legalize these same practices with the directive on Computer 
implemented-inventions (CII) from 2003 to 2005. In fact, a software 
patent system in Europe could only be counterproductive and 
disastrous for economic development. 

For more information on the threat of software patents,see the 
US Blackberry case which perfectly illustrates that patent 
system is not adapted to ensure software IP protection, and even
is dangerous to innovative and competitive businesses.

However, the battle against software patents is not finished.

--

In January 2006, the European Commission started a public consultation
"on the future of the Community Patent in Europe" on the pretext of
promoting of developing free market and protecting innovation. In reality, 
the aim is to legalize software patents by transferring EU
and member state legislative and judicial power to the European Patent
Office. FFII first questioned the validity of the procedure, based on the
serious lack of accessibility, which means that a majority of EU
businesses were completely excluded from answering. That's why FFII
recommended participation to those businesses that are able to do so,
for "Open democracy" means more transparency and effective hearings of
all stakeholders... Following a formal complaint by FFII to the European
Commission's President Barroso, European the Commission agreed to 
extend its deadline from 31 March 2006 to 12 April 2006. 

The next step after the public consultation is the public hearing taking
place the 12th July. The Commission is first supposed to present a document
outlining the preliminary findings of the consultation based on replies
received until 12 April 2006. But is highly possible the total number of 
answers worrying against the reintroduction of software patents won't 
be revealed as it is the habit of the European Commission. Then, 
the Internal Market DG will directly consult stakeholders on their needs
in relation to the legal framework and possible actions in the field of 
industrial property. The European Commission 39 selected "stakeholders" 
supposed to reflect the balance of opinion in the written replies 
will speak on the issues raised during the hearing. In reality, 
the great majority are patents proponents, mostly software patent proponents 
like Nokia, Qualcomm, ICT Ireland, Thomson...

One of the most important topics will be the European Patent Litigation
Agreement (EPLA), which is a proposed patent law agreement aimed at 
creating an optional protocol to the European Patent Convention (EPC), 
which would commit its signatory states to an integrated judicial system. 
The main driving force behind the EPLA is legalising software patents and 
business method patents via case law, under the assumption that the European 
Patent Convention still forbids those with the European Patent Office 
nevertheless granting them since the mid 1980s. Moreover The proposed 
"European Patent Judiciary" would lack independent judges and sufficient 
democratic control.

It seems that software patents are coming by the back doors, mainly through
the European Patent litigation Agreement (EPLA) pushed by both the European
Commission and the European Patent Office, in despite of the decision of the
European Parliament to definitively bury the CII directive on the 6 July 
2006. But the European Commission strikes back.

Of course, FFII attend to this public consultation and Pieter Hintjens will speak
in the name of FFII in order to defend the general interest of European software 
companies, accompanied with Florian Mueller who will speak in the name of the Open
source communities. FFII is not alone, it seems that only 4 other NGOs will speak 
against the threat of the European Patent Litigation Agreement. 

- UEAPME (Maria Cimaglia)

- BEUC (Cornelia Kutterer)

- PIMEC (Marcelino Currel - Suñol)

- ECIS (Thomas Vinje)

Welcome to the world of the European democracy and fair economic representativity.
