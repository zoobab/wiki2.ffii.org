''10 March 2005 -- Manuel Castells uses the recent decision of the Council of Ministers of the EU over software patents to exemplify the resistance of a European culture which doesn't favour innovation.''

 Q: Is your criticism about the "Lisbon Agenda" brakes a criticism on the [Member] States?

 A: It's a criticism on the States and a self-criticism on the strategy designers. Concretely,
 software is the language of the information age. If it doesn't work, nothing else does, because
 it is the heart of the technological system. Today [[7th |March]], the Council of Ministers can
 be approving the possibility to patent software, even though the European Parliament has opposed
 it twice. Patenting software equals destroying software. The vast majority of created software
 in the workd is best done by people no one pays, which places their work on-line, making its
 source code available for others to access and maybe improve it. All this will stop happening
 if someone patents it.
