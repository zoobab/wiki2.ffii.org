== Outline ==

 * Public Patent Foundation achieved a major success by getting the USPTO to agree to reexamine the Microsoft FAT patents.
 * This is unusual, given that the FAT patents are from the 1980s
 * This does not necessarily mean that the USPTO believes that Pubpat's prior art is very strong, but it could mean that.
 * Pubpat representatives replied evasively about his stand on whether software patentability is compatible with the goal of "sound patent policy", which Pubpat endorses
