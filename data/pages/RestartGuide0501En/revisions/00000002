=== Why? ===

The adoption of EU Council's "common position" on a software patent directive has been delayed once again.  This opens another window of opportunity for the European Parliament to restart the entire process. The horrible Council text of 18 May 2004 would be cancelled that way.  

Since the political situation in Europe has changed and ever more countries oppose the idea of patents that can affect standard computer software, it is almost certain that future negotiations in the EU Council would lead to a much more acceptable result.

If the directive is not referred to the parliament again the Council's
horrible text would go to the European Parliament and it would have
vote on it in second reading under extremely difficult condidions.

Firstly, only 3 to 4 months are availabile until the vote has to be scheduled
and secondly, failure to adopt a critical amdendment under the difficult condition
that each amendent requires at least 367 "yes" votes -
(this means 60 to 70% of MEPs present in the plenary chamber need to vote "yes" - this is only possible with big coalitions) would make software patentable under this text.

The Council could then possibly be pressed to adopt it and the directive would enter into force. If it does not, the process would go to 3rd reading to find a middle way between the two positions of Parliament and Council. At this stage, where much more time and work has went into  it, it basically never happens that a directive is rejected, however bad it is. This means, if we want a good directive and not reject in 2nd reading, the best option is to restart the process and have the central amendments of Parliament's amendments adopted in Council.

This is then a much better starting point for a 2nd and 3rd reading than the current situaion.

=== How much time do we have? ===

The calendar now gives the European Parliament time until at least the week of 21 February (next part-session) to request a renewed referral.

However, the most important decision will already be taken on 2 or 3 February.  On those days, the [[http://www.europarl.eu.int/committees/juri_home.htm|Legal Affairs Committee ("JURI") of the European Parliament]] will meet.  That is the committee in charge of the software patent directive.  A majority of the committee responsible is a requirement for a renewed referral according to Rule 55.1 of the EP's Rules of Procedure.

If JURI decides in our favor, then it may still be necessary to secure the consent of the [[http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/p_meps.bodylist?ilg=EN&iothbody=BCPR&iorig=|Conference of Presidents (Chairmen/Presidents of the groups)]]. The !CoP will meet on 17 February.

=== Who is decisive? ===

The immediate priority are the members of JURI, but indirectly all other MEPs can promote the idea of restarting the process within their groups.  Even outside of the European Parliament, you may be able to find politicians, such as national MPs, who can contact their colleagues in Brussels about this.

=== How to make contact? ===

In general, email works fine to contact a politician, as long as you don't use a standard letter (10 different letters make more impact than 100 times the same one). Make it short, to the point and put in links to more information (or attach documents with more information). Snail mail letters are outdated and take too long to reach them.

It is up to you how much effort you put into your letter.  It's not necessary, and from the perspective of politicians, not even desirable that you go into too much detail.  Try to explain in your own words that and why you believe software patents are negative to you, and ask the recipient to support the idea of restarting the process on the software patent directive at the request of the parliament. '''Make sure you remain polite at all times.'''

If you are a company owner or freelancer, please make sure that your mail clearly indicates your commercial background.

Note: Mrs. Mohácsi is member of the liberal ALDE group in the EP.  In that group, we have a number of honest politicians who are on our side and want to prevent software patents.  However, in that group you also find a Dutch party named VVD, which pushes for software patents more aggressively, and with more disgraceful methods, than any other party in all of Europe.

The VVD is the party of former EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein, who initiated the whole process on this directive only to legalize software patents, and of MEP Toine Manders, who constantly tries to pull the entire ALDE group in a pro-patent direction.

Please ask Mrs. Mohácsi to not adopt any advice from her Dutch colleagues of the VVD.

Note: Mr. Doorn has a very good voting record from the 1st reading in the European Parliament.  He voted very clearly against software patents.  Also, his party supported a motion in the Dutch parliament on 1 July 2004 against software patents.

However, that party has a government coalition with a Dutch party named VVD, which pushes for software patents more aggressively, and with more disgraceful methods, than any other party in all of Europe.  The VVD is the party of former EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein, who initiated the whole process on this directive only to legalize software patents and of MEP Toine Manders, who constantly tries to pull the entire ALDE group in a pro-patent direction.

Nevertheless, it is extremely doubtful that Doorn would blindly follow Manders, and simply not mentioning Manders to him may be the best tactic. He has also already complained about a lot of mail he gets on this topic and he will soon have a personal meeting with some experienced people, so it may be best to leave him alone for now.

For Spain, open-source software is a particular opportunity that already plays a major role in public administrations throughout the country.
