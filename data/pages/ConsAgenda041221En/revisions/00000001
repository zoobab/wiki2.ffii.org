''*Brussels, 21 December 2004*'' --
Normally, all A-items are adopted in block at the start of a Council meeting (right after the adoption of the agenda for the meeting). However, a [http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/agricult/83234.pdf revised] version of the agenda posted this morning notes that the approval of the software patent directive has now been moved to the afternoon.

'''Update:''' The Council Secretariat's Public Information service explains the reason for the delay:

  The "A" items have been announced for 15.00 under "public deliberation", as the
  Polish Minister wishes to make a statement concerning item 16 (patentability of
  computer-implemented inventions). Also for technical reasons, the list of "A"
  items and its addenda will be adopted at the end of the afternoon.
