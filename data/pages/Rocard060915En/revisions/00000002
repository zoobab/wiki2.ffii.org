''The European Commission refuses to comment on any proposed solution to resolve crucial problems with the EPLA in its replies to questions by Michel Rocard MEP, both regarding costs and the absence of separation of powers. The Commission also recognises that it has nothing to say about the software patent granting practice of the EPO and on the way the EPLA could equally recognise or invalidate this jurisprudence. In this context it is interesting that the Commission nevertheless seems to unconditionally support the EPLA, even though it has apparently no idea about its consequences.''

== Question about the cost of patents ==

  31 July 2006
  E-3582/06
  WRITTEN QUESTION by Michel Rocard (PSE) to the Commission
  
  Subject: Cost of patent cases before the European Patent Judiciary set up under the EPLA
  
  Page 13 of the European Patent Office's assessment of the impact of the
  European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), dated February 2006, shows
  that the minimum costs of a medium-scale patent case brought before the
  future European Patent Court at first instance are barely lower than the
  costs if the same case were brought simultaneously in Germany, France and
  the Netherlands and that the minimum costs of a case at second instance
  are barely lower than those of simultaneously bringing the same case
  before a court in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

  Given that SMES can often afford to bring only one case at a time, and
  have to rely on the settlement of that case in order to have the funds to
  bring another if need be, how does the Commission justify this rise in
  the cost of litigation, both in itself but primarily with regard to the
  interests of SMEs?

  The Commission says the European Community is not part of the EPLA
  working groups and that therefore it's not within the Commission's
  competence to analyse the cost structures of the EPLA or their impact on
  !SMEs. It therefore will not undertake such an analysis. Next, the
  Commission starts talking about it's [http://consultation.ffii.org/
  Patent Consultation] and that it will of course inform the Parliament
  about its results.

  The project on the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) is based
  on an initiative of the contracting states to the European Patent
  Organisation, to which the European Community is not a contracting party,
  and is being worked out y a workgroup on litigation, without
  participation of the Community. As the honorable member has mentioned,
  the European Patent Office (acting as a secretariat for the workgroup on
  litigation) has performed an impact assessment concerning the EPLA's
  influence on European patent litigation. It is consequently not up to the
  Commission to analyse the cost structures under the EPLA, nor to justify
  the costs calculated by the European Patent Office.


  Nevertheless, in the context of the consultation on the political future
  of European patent system, the Commission is currently in the process of
  examining the issue of the draft European Patent Litigation Agreement
  (EPLA) and the possibility of moving the project forward in the context
  of its consultation on the future patent policy in Europe. However, the
  question of a predictable, quick and cheap resolution of cases between
  patent holders and others is one of the main concerns of the Commission.
  Cheaper lawsuits would have a very positive impact on the use of patents
  by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The consultation was
  launched on 16 January 2006 and proved to be a huge success, generating
  over 2 500 answers from interested circles. A public hearing took place
  on 12 July 2006. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the
  responses and drawing its conclusions. Naturally, the Parliament will be
  informed about the Commission's findings and recommendations as soon as
  they have been finalized.

== Question on the separation of powers with the EPLA ==

  31 July 2006
  E-3581/06
  WRITTEN QUESTION by Michel Rocard (PSE) to the Commission

  Subject: Separation of powers within the European Patent Judiciary set up under
  the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement)

  A Community system for settling patent disputes can only exist if it is
  fully part of the European legal order and is completely independent of
  the legislature and the executive, in line with the principle of
  separation of powers.

  It follows that judges called on to issue rulings within the European
  Patent Judiciary may not concurrently hold or have held a post in the
  various chambers of the European Patent Office or within national offices
  responsible for issuing patents.

  What steps has the Commission taken or does it intend to take in this
  regard?

  How to structure the rules for the judges of the European Patent Court is
  a question which requires a thorough analysis. The Commission is
  currently not in the position to comment on this subject.

== Question on the jurisprudence regarding software patents and the EPLA ==

  31 July 2006	
  E-3580/06
  WRITTEN QUESTION by Michel Rocard (PSE) to the Commission

  Subject: Case law and innovation policy within the European Patent Judiciary
  set up under the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement)

  A series of case-law decisions by the Technical Appeal Board of the
  European Patent Office has led to the issuing of software patents and
  patents on business methods (which correspond to USPTO Class 705).

  Does the Commission agree that the inclusion of software within the
  parameters of patentability was not a technical decision but a
  substantial change to patent law, which is outside the jurisdiction of
  any court, and that decisions of this kind need to be dealt with
  appropriately at a political level, i.e. they must take the form of
  legislation?

  What mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with regard to
  the EPLA to ensure that similar excesses do not occur?

=== Answer (unofficial English translation) ===

  Answer give by Mr. McCreevy
  in the name of the Commission
  (14.9.2006)

  The Commission agrees with the honorable member that it is important to
  guarantee the separation of powers between the legislative bodies and the
  judiciary.

  A legislative instrument codifies the juridical situation in a particular
  domain.

  A juridical system, such as the one proposed by the EPLA project,
  interprets the substantive rules regarding the existing patents, but does
  not change nor codify those rules. In the context of the separation of
  powers, it takes over the ability of courts to interpret the provisions
  of the law.

  The European Community is not a contracting party of the European Patent
  Organisation (EPOrg). Consequently the Commission is not competent to
  interpret decisions by the technical chambers of the EPOrg.

  The Commission is currently not in a position to comment on the
  envisioned structure of the European Patent Court.

  The Commission is currently in the process of examining the issue of the
  draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) and the possibility of
  moving the project forward in the context of its consultation on the
  future patent policy in Europe. Naturally, the Parliament will be informed about
  the Commission's findings and recommendations as soon as they have been
  finalized.
