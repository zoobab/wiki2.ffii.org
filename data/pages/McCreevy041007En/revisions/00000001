In response to questions on software patents raised by Maria BERGER (PES, AT) and Heide
RÃœHLE (Greens/EFA, DE), he acknowledged the concerns of the open-source software
community about effect of new patent laws. "These are aimed at creating legal certainty," he said. He professed himself willing "to enter discussions to reach a reasonable balance which favoured neither one side nor the other."

== Comment ==

Legal certainty for the legal escape of the EPO means insecurity for the software market.

The Commissioner cannot "enter discussions to reach a reasonable balance which
favoured neither one side nor the other" because his administration is the driving forces for a unpleasent directive. The European Parliament heavily amended the Commissions/BSA directive because it was unacceptable. Even the council version 18-05-2004 was largely based on pressure from the Commission. Bolkestein decepted the government representatives. In fact there are no legitimate interest groups in favour of software patents despite the patent system, patent professionals and non-European stakeholders -- or hired guns such as the "Campaign for Creativity". The opposition to Bolkestein's line is much broader than the "Open Source Community", it includes almost everyone who works with software and faces problems with bad patent pratice today. 350 000 Europeans signed the [http://petition.eurolinux.org NoePatents-Petition].
