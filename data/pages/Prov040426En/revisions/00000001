= 2004-04-26 Mathematical Proof to lead software patentability ad absurdum =

The programmer Dipl. Ing.(FH) Juergen Ernst from Pirmasens, germany, has developed a mathematical proof 
to show the absurdity of software patents, based on a simple model of patents and a few uncontroversial assumptions
about software.

Mr. Ernst explains:  

  "With this proof I try to lift the argumentation about software patents to another level.  
  If it is provable that '''all''' programs are concerned, then nobody can dismiss the fears of the software patent 
  opponents as speculation." 

Everyone who is interested in the proof will find it here:

There has already been a lot of argument about the logical inconsistency of software patents, e.g.

 * [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/ist-tamai98/ Tamai 1998: Abstraction-Orientated Property of Software]
 * Smets 1999 on Useright

The inadequacy of the system for software is also beyond serious dispute and has led to continued animosity
in the software industry.

All this has not prevented those who steer the patent system from pressing ahead with software patentability.
The patent system is run by patent lawyers and patent officials.  These have only learnt one solution, which
they apply to all problems and which assures them a continued gravy train running to their offices: "patent".
