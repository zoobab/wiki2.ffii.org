== Darkice streamer ==

You can get the sound from your OSS or ALSA sound card, encode it, and send it to the icecast2 streaming server with darkice. You need to install liblame if you want to compile it with MP3 support.

Here is the config file used:

 # sample DarkIce configuration file, edit for your needs before using
 # see the darkice.cfg man page for details

 # this section describes general aspects of the live streaming session
 [general]
 duration        = 0        # duration of encoding, in seconds. 0 means forever
 bufferSecs      = 2         # size of internal slip buffer, in seconds

 # this section describes the audio input that will be streamed
 [input]
 device          = /dev/dsp  # OSS DSP soundcard device for the audio input
 sampleRate      = 22050     # sample rate in Hz. try 11025, 22050 or 44100
 bitsPerSample   = 16        # bits per sample. try 16
 channel         = 2         # channels. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo

 # this section describes a streaming connection to an IceCast server
 # there may be up to 8 of these sections, named [icecast-0] ... [icecast-7]
 # these can be mixed with [icecast2-x] and [shoutcast-x] sections

== Streamtranscode ==

Streamtranscode is used on the server apunkt.ffii.org to reencode the stream in several bitrates (ex: slow PPP phone lines) or codecs.

== Todo ==

 * Lower stream for slow PPP connexions
 * Save the stream in a file with darkice
 * Get a sound system with a portable microphone
