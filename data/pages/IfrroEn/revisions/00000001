== Activities ==

 * 2004-11 took part in EU Copyright and Neighbouring Rights consultation
 * Does not want to get DRM regulation imposed on business: 
 Nevertheless, IFRRO believes that DRMs are not yet ready to play the role of a universal panacea and that  
 it is the right of the rights holders to choose the most appropriate type of management. Furthermore, it 
 notes that there are fields of collective management in which DRMS cannot stand-alone. Further, the great 
 national archives of works existing in analogue form may not be digitised ever. Furthermore, while all 
 concerned sectors are focusing on improving the performance of the DRMs, we do have to remind ourselves 
 that these systems for the time being do not
 consistently perform well enough and sometimes are not secure enough either. At present, it
 does not seem likely that DRMs will be able to provide an effective option in the licensing of
 copying of paper originals (as opposed to digital versions) for the reasonably foreseeable future.

== Comments ==

 * The submission by IFRRO relies mainly on broad political arguments and praises of the Commission (so called diplomacy).  Like many organisations that claim to represent "industry", IFRRO does not care to substantiate its statements by going into any level of technical detail.
