The Secretary for Telecommunications and Information Society in the Department for Universities, Research and Information Society in the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalan government) reaffirmed yesterday (wednesday 2004.11.24), in a work dinner by the "Asociación de Empresas de Electrónica, Tecnologías de la Información y Telecomunicaciones" (AETIC) (the Spanish member association of EICTA), the "Catalan government compromise with free software and open standards" and took a stance against software patents.

Oriol Ferran explained, answering a software development manager, that the proposals for the directive that the Council of the EU is debating, are against innovation and the essence of the concepts defended and proposed by the free software development model. 

In his speech, Oriol Ferran also endorsed the position of the Spanish government, which, in last may voted against the proposal. The past week, other governments, such as Poland, shown their opposition to software patentability, like Dutch and German Parliaments.

Ferran deplored the fact that the clear and firm stance of the European Parliament, which voted against software patents one year ago, is being questioned by the Council. The Competitivity Council, which was suposed to meet this thursday in Brussels, has postponed its decision on the directive.

The head of the Department of University, Research and Information Society, ''conseller'' Carles Solà, which has repeatedly insisted on the government compromise with free software, spoke against software patents in the presentation of [[http://www.lafarga.org|laFarga.org]] (a government funded web site on free software in Catalonia) held on october the 8th.

Solà in that occasion joined the opposition to monopolies and patents, pointing out that they hinder innovation.  Due to the high cost associated with patenting, SMEs are put at a disadvantage and companies are forced to divert resources that could have been allocated to innovation, Solà said.

== Context of the Meeting ==

'''Oriol Ferran (Catalan government) speaks against software patents as debated in the EU'''

Today the Competitivity Counciol of Ministers of the EU has delayed its deliberation on the matter.

The Catalan government has no word in the council, but together with past pressure from Extremadura, València, Andalucia and potentially other administrations with free software projects, adds its pressure against swpats in the Spanish government.  Politically, the Catalan government is held by a coalition of Partit Socialista de Catalunya (in PSE), Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (in ALE=EFA Greens) i Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds (in European Greens, Greens EFA too).  The Spanish government is held by Partido Socialista Obrero Español, (in PSE) close to PSC. The other groups are friendly in the Spanish congress and helped invest the Spanish government.
