== Introduction ==

What follows is a list of abbreviations commonly used in the documentation, in the names of database objects, and in the names of objects in the source code of related programs.
 * ML: Mailing List
 * NG: News Group

== Database Tables and Views ==

=== Project Mailing Lists ===

Associated with every project are mailing lists (and gated news groups, if desired).  These mailing lists are called ''project mailing lists''.

 * [=proj]: Projects (gating of associated mailing lists can be enabled/disabled, here).
 * [=projmlts]: Types of project mailing lists.
 * [=projmltwildmats]: INN wildmat patterns describing news groups gated to/from project mailing lists of a certain type.  This table may contain several wildmats for the same project mailing list type (which is useful, for example, if two project hierarchies coexist after a change in news group naming policy).
 * [=projmls]: A view that lists all project mailing lists (it assembles the names from the entries in the tables [=proj] and [=projmlts]).
 * [=projgated]: Projects whose mailing lists currently are gated to/from news groups or that were gated to/from news groups (gate disabled).  The contents of this table are created automatically by the program updating the gateway configuration.
 * [=proj2bgated]: A view that lists projects with associated mailing lists that should be gated to/from news groups.
 * [=projprm]: Lists the level of participation of users in projects (necessary for determining access rights for news groups).
 * [=flddes]: Contains descriptions of the items below and more:
   * projects (used for the descriptions of news groups)
   * project mailing list types
   * database items such as tables and fields
 * [=projtxt]: Contains descriptions of projects (used for the descriptions of news groups, but entries in flddes have a higher priority).

=== Non-Project Mailing Lists ===

 * [=lists]: Non-project mailing lists (gating can be enabled/disabled, here).
 * [=listgrp]: Groups classifying non-project mailing lists.
 * [=listsgated]: Non-project mailing lists that currently are gated to/from news groups or that were gated to/from news groups (gate disabled).  The contents of this table are created automatically by the program updating the gateway configuration.
 * [=lists2bgated]: A view that lists non-project mailing lists that should be gated to/from news groups.
 * [=subs]: Users subscribed to non-project mailing lists. (Necessary, also for determining access rights for some gated news groups.)
 * [=flddes]: Contains descriptions of mailing lists.

feklee assumes that the following tables are not in use at the moment (e.g. because they are deprecated):
 * [=subs1]
 * [=subs2]
 * [=listvars]

=== Project and Non-Project Mailing Lists ===

 * [=mlnggates]: Currently enabled and disabled gates mediating between mailing lists and news groups.  In other words: This table reflects the current INN and Procmail configuration.  As of this writing, an automatic update of this table is initiated by the program update_gated_ngs.  In general, this table shouldn't be updated manually.
