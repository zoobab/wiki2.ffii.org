= Introduction =

We have contacts in some large ISP/telco's, and need a nice, not too long, but strong document to show how the directive could affect them.

= Arguments =

 * Microsoft is agressivly patenting software to be used on handheld devices that will shape the way that services are used unless services can also be arranged by the operators as todays. Note that 70% of the patents are US&JP! Double-click on handhelds was just the top of otherwise business method oriented claims to the telecom lanscape.

 * Same for television. The EU vs Microsoft trial just shows that there will be more to come when MS has patent-claims to the distribution.

 * [[SwxaiAcaciaEn| Acacia]] will probably also start charging for 3g-video or even gsm voice since they now own EPO patents for time-stamped image/audio streams. Disney pays, others are forced to pay up to 2% of their income to stream. Other patent-cowboys like this are crawling up all around since the Council only offer us fake limits on patentability.

 * IBM&EPO made [[http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/needs/#publi|publishing an infringement]], creating a brand new US-like set of patents also claiming publication (record on a carrier). This will affect Internet, the main source of knowledge sharing in development today and also the distributors of Internet and Internet services.

 * Patents now claim business monopolies (on methods) in the light of the interpretations of new technical effects in logic. This will and must be considered a problem for the carriers as much as the provider of information services.

 * If software patents come in to existence, patent holders will try to enlist carriers in tracking patent infringers as the content industry is currently trying to enlist carriers to track content.

 * VoIP technology is already covered by several patents (codecs g7xx), which makes impossible to create new server solutions for their customers.

 * Canadian Patent # 2303392 on VoIP-calling 911 may not be valid, but it is a sign of what kind of patents that can be anticipated in VoIP applications.
