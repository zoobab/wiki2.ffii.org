Bruce Lehmann presided over the USPTO for a few years in the 90s and is still active at WIPO as a patent expert and patent evangelist.  He firmly believes in the beneficiality of the system and the need to promote it throughout the world and to all "fields of technology", including computing and business methods.  Espoused his beliefs at [:Swpoecd038En: OECD meeting of 2003/08 in Paris], appeared aggressively pro-patent even in comparison with the EPO representatives, paralelled only by the USPTO representative Boland.
