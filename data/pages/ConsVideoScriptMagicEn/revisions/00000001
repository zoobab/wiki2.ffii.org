Script:

Bolkestein (this is from v002.ogg, 39:35):

    The Commission has debated quite a long time about the possibility
    that a computer program as such could or should be patentable, and
    has decided against it. And in order to make this absolutely and
    perfectly clear, the Commission should like to introduce two
    amendments in Article 4a, which is entitled "exclusions from
    patentability". The Commission should like to propose a new Part 1
    to this Article 4a, and the new Part 1 should quite simply read: "A
    computer program as such cannot constitute a patentable invention".
    I should take that as clear, and should allay any kind of
    apprehensions that, by some magical means, a computer program as
    such could after all become patentable; once again let me read it
    out for all clarity's sake: "A computer program as such cannot
    constitute a patentable invention".

(Fade out, short pause, fade-in in silence):

    Article 5 (2).

    A claim to a computer program ... shall not be allowed, unless
    [:condition :that can always be made true].
