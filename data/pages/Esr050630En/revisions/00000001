''During FÃ³rum Internacional de Software Livre in Brazil Open Source evangelist Eric Raymond was questioned about software patents.'' 

== Opinions ==

 * About patent donations of IBM

 Think back to the days of the Cold War. If the Soviets let some 
 dissidents out of jail, would you have told them "No, put those
  people back in jail" because you thought accepting that action 
 meant supporting the Gulag?

 * Software patents cannot be stopped

 It's not like we could stop them, really.

 * Patents are bad for standards

 A "standard" with blocking patents is a dangerous trap.
