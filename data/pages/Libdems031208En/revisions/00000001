LDYS [http://www.ldys.org.uk/web/policy/softwarepatents.html Motion] on software patents passed in at their party conference in October 2003.
This is a very well-worded motion, with maybe one minor wording problem on "industrial" application. It specifically calls LDYS to sign the FFII petition, and on MEPs to vote with party policy.
