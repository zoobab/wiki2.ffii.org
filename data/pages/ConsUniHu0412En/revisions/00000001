2. Statement by Hungary

   (Translation in English provided by the Hungarian delegation)

Concerning the proposal for a Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented
inventions, the Hungarian government agrees to the goals laid down therein, in particular
to the following:
 * strengthening legal certainty and hereby ensuring predictability necessary for taking economic decisions;
 * securing the smooth functioning of the internal market by eliminating the differences in the case law of the Member States;
 * strengthening the competitiveness of the European information technology industry on the global market;
 * stimulating innovation and creative activities in this important field of technology.
Hungary supports the adoption of Community legislation on the patentability of
computer-implemented inventions in order to establish clear conditions for patentability
and to harmonise the different practices of Member States.

At the Competitiveness Council meeting of May 17-18 2004, where amendments to the
proposed Directive were adopted, Hungary underlined, in addition to the above-
mentioned goals, that the Directive also has to take account of the interests of small and
medium-sized enterprises. As the amendments adopted at that meeting followed this goal,
Hungary supported the proposal with its vote in the debate.
However, Hungary pays particular attention to the interests of the market players, with
special regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, to ensure that their interest should
properly be reflected in the forthcoming stages of the co-decision procedure and in the
course of the implementation of the Directive.
