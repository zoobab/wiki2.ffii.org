== Howto access ==

The European Parliament has now wifi access only for !MEPs and staff in the whole building in Brussels, and in some rooms (bar + 6 other rooms: S1.4 N1.4 N1.3 N1.2 R1.1 R3.1) in Strasbourg. The ESSID is EP-EXT, there is DHCP, and you need to go to https://fwauth to put your login and password. Using ssh to access a server located on the internet works.

  network, while ensuring a high level of performance, a dedicated network, known as a
  CyberLAN, should be installed. Members would be able to connect their personal equipment

  84. Notes that information technology services for Members have been further improved, in
  particular:
   as a result of improved IT facilities for Members' offices;
   by setting up a CyberLAN network, to which any computer can be connected;
   by launching a pilot project on the introduction of an electronic signature system;
   through improved measures to protect servers, workstations and network
  components;
   by equipping Parliament with a wireless communications structure (hotspots and
  wireless fidelity);
