On 6 July the [:SwpatbmjDe: German Ministry of Justice] in cooperation with the [:SwpatdpmaDe: German Patent and Trademark Office], [:HeinrichVonPiererDe: Siemens CEO Heinrich v. Pierer] and others are staging a [:Dpma040706De: propaganda rally] in Munich, in which they suggest to chancellor [:SwpatschroederDe: Gerhard Schroeder] and other influential guests that innovation is indispensably related to "intellectual property", a term which they use as a code word for the patent system.  The organizers and most of the announced participants are known supporters of software patentability and key players in the EU Council's efforts to sidestep the European Parliament's decision against software patentability of September 2003.

Proposals from FFII to open up the Munich rally and allow critical assessment of the patent system's impact on innovation were refused by the organisers.  However four FFII representatives were invited as observers to the event.

[:HartmutPilchEn: Hartmut Pilch] explains: Today's patent celebration is unlikely to provide much room for voicing the concerns of real-life innovation.  Also, we are not as fortunate as Heinrich von Pierer, who has been 
[http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/telcos1107/ whispering] patent fairy tales from 1001 nights directly into the chancellor's ear.  Yet the event provides interesting opportunities for communication.  Eventually the mundane realities of patents as brakes on innovation will find their way to the decisionmakers.

== Vigil against Software Patents ==

On 06.07.2004 Munich hosts a symposium titled [:Dpma040706De: "Innovation und geistiges Eigentum in Deutschland"].

Place: Munich '' Museumsinsel '' Deutsches Museum / Ehrensaal
Time of the Vigil: 10:00-14:00 Uhr in front of the museum

Participants:
 * (optionally) contact jwildeboer (att) domainfactory.de (0174 7917833)
 * Arrive at 9:30 at the museum shop in front of the museum, there distribution of costumes etc

This encompasses the following event:

 * 30 [http://segert.net/softwarepatente/16.php "Programmers in chains"] will serve as vigil for the event.

These "Programmers in chains" will hold boards explaining why they are in prisoners clothes such as "I use a firewall under linux", "I have programmed a webshop" etc

We will try to reach to the chancellor etc as soon as possible. Because we can send now four number of persons to the event, we will try to get as much media attention as possible.
