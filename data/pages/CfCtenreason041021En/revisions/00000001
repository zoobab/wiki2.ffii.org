The Campaign for Creativity does list 10 reasons for the software patent directive.

=== Reason 1 ===
 Protection of intellectual property rights is a human right 
 enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and   
 the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. It is unfair to 
 deny individuals or companies the right to protect their 
 intellectual property.

Dubious natural law argue. Juristic bullshit. The implementations in the human rights declaration are related to copyrights. The [http://www.europarl.eu.int/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf Charter of Fundamental Rights] solely says "Intellectual property shall be protected".
Companys dont have human rights! => Logical error. 

=== Reason 2 ===
 Patents protect functions, concepts and ideas.
 Computer-implemented inventions cannot be protected by copyright.

Juristical clumsy constructions of a protection gap.

=== Reason 3 ===

 SMEs need the protection of patents. Without legal protection,
 small companies will have their best ideas stolen.

Logic?

=== Reason 4 ===
 Patents enhance and stimulate competition. They encourage
 companies to find new solutions to particular problems.

Economically unsustainable argue. Patents are an invasion to the free market and do limit by definition the competition.

=== Reason 5 ===
 Patents help young software firms attract investment.
 This creates jobs and stimulates more innovation.

Shaky chain of causation. No evidences.

=== Reason 6 ===
 Patents make inventions public and enhance transparency.

Disclosure effect of the patent protection; its questionable if a disclosure of patent scriptures does have any public values in our sector. This evidences have to be supplied.

=== Reason 7 ===
 If patents really damaged innovation, we would see evidence already.

New and smart idea. But sorry, such evidences do exist and all politicians do care for saying that they dont want "american circumstances".

=== Reason 8 ===
 Without a strong directive, European companies will be
 less able to protect themselves.

For this reason we do need a strong directive that will protect us Europeans from the problem of software patenting. Just only a quarter of the the european software patents do originate from inside Europe. So if following a strategic consideration then the installation of a patent system in this sector will lead to a buy out of the european software economy.

=== Reason 9 ===
 Inventors in other sectors are permitted to patent their
 inventions, it is illogical and unfair to discriminate
 against the information technology sector.

Patents are an economic system of attraction that only should be used where there is an economic advantage. Information technology does not get touched. Software is in the sense of patent law not a technical doctrine.

=== Reason 10 ===
 The intellectual property system has safeguards against over-broad and trivial patents.

There is no "Intellectual property system". We dont know about the said protection mechanisms. There is no better protection than a good and clear directive.
