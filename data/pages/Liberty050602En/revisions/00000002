''2005-06-02: A huge Statue of Liberty was erected at Place du Luxembourg/Brussels.''

A Statue at Place du Luxembourg signalled the protest against software patenting. Unfortunately the demonstration could not pass Place du Luxembourg, but soon after the demonstration many participants took part in a free software dinner organised by FSF Europe in a Caf√© at Place du Luxembourg. The Statue demonstrated bypassers the rejection of the Uncommon Council Position unter surveillance of organiser Benjamin Henrion (Association Electronic Libre. The statue of liberty uses the symbolic statue known from the Eurolinux-Petition Logo. Therefore the Statue wears the logo banner of the petition of 400 000 Europeans: "No ePatents!"
