 the European Parliament last month failed to agree on a 
 Europe-wide standard for patenting computer related inventions. 
 Opponents of patent protection argued that Europe's software 
 industry would be destroyed by patents. That debate has rekindled

 In the Advisory Committees opinion, the Directive wrongly persists in
 the view that the Directive concerns solely the patenting of computer 
 implemented inventions. This gives rise to the suggestion that there is 
 a distinction between such inventions and patents on software inventions 
 or computer programmes. However, in practice this distinction cannot be 
 (properly) made and will become more and more blurred in the future as well.

 It is important to acknowledge in the discussion that patents on 
 computer programmes do indeed exist.

 Software-related claims

 Software as an expression of functionality in a computer can be more 
 efficiently protected by patents than by copyright. Additionally, 
 software can be used in almost any technical field. This is why industry 
 has been recently pushing for software patents.

 The European Patent Convention (EPC) does not allow patenting of 
 computer programs "as such". Recent case law from the EPO Boards of 
 Appeal has clarified what is a "computer program as such" and has 
 established a new practice. Moreover, in the ongoing process of EPC 
 revision it is envisaged to delete the exclusion of computer programs 
 from non-patentable subject-matter. This development will be in line 
 with the findings of the recent Green Paper of the EU Commission on the 
 patenting system in the EU, as well as with the TRIPS agreement."

 Programs for computers are a form of "computer-implemented invention", an 
 expression intended to cover claims which involve computers, computer networks 
 or other conventional programmable apparatus whereby prima facie the novel 
 features of the claimed invention are realised by means of a program or programs.
 ...
 The basic patentability considerations here are in principle the same 
 as for other subject-matter. While "programs for computers" are included 
 among the items listed in Art. 52(2), if the claimed subject-matter has a 
 technical character it is not excluded from patentability by the provisions
 of Art. 52(2) and (3). 
http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/gui_lines/e/c_iv_2_3_6.htm

Remark: EPC 52(2) says "The following in particular shall '''not be regarded as inventions''' ... (c) schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers;", and you will not find the requirement of a "technical character" in EPC 52 which transforms software into an invention, see [[http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/epc52/exeg/index.en.html#epra|analysis and EPO criticism of Lenz]].

 Jeremy Philpott, a marketing executive and former senior examiner for the U.K. Patent Office,

 in practice many such patents are granted.

 "The intended purpose of the directive is to clarify the law while maintaining the status quo," 
 Philpott said. "Anything unpatentable now, such as business methods, should remain so when the 
 directive comes in, whereas software which has a technical contribution and is patentable now 
 would still be patentable."

 In June, during the Irish presidency, a compromise concerning the so-called
 software patent directive was passed with the narrowest possible
 majority, which means that standards and interoperability
 (communication between systems/user) is not protected against
 patenting. Specifically, this means that the compromise makes it legal
 to patent standards and software, which are necessary for ensuring
 interoperability without having to run a hurdle race over various
 patents, which is very destructive for open standards, unhindered
 communication between public systems and private, and the development
 of software.

  The uncertainty over software patentability in Europe is an
  obstacle that he would dearly like to see removed. "Our algorithm
  patents cover functions which are protected per se, however
  they are implemented. But we have not patented software as such,
  despite the potential for a wide variety of inventions in this field."

  "This is why we stress the need for Europe to move forward
  in software patenting," he says.

  The situation also has some very practical implications for IP
  practice within Thales, and not just for their IP experts.
  "Our engineers have been taught that software is not patentable,"
  he says. "So they have been unaware of the growing opportunities
  for software-related patents. We need to develop awareness in our
  inventors so that they know not only that software is patentable
  but also how to patent it." In particular, he encourages Thales'
  software engineers to monitor the patent literature as a source
  of ideas for new inventions, as hardware engineers have for many
  years.

== 2001-04-27 intellectual-property.gov.uk: Can I patent computer software? ==
 It is possible to patent programs for computers which, 
 when run on a computer produce a "technical effect". However,
 if a program does not produce a technical effect when run on 
 a computer it is unlikely to be patentable. A technical effect
 is generally an improvement in technology, and needs to be
 in an area of technology which is patentable.

 For instance, an improved program for translating between 
 Japanese and English is not patentable because linguistics 
 is a mental process, not a technical field. On the other 
 hand a program which speeds up image enhancement may be 
 patentable because it produces a technical improvement 
 in a technical area. Other restrictions also apply - 
 the UK Patent Office web site has a practice notice on 
 patenting computer software.

 The European Patent Office (EPO) takes a similar approach
 to the UK Patent Office on patenting software.

 "Changing the law would be a signal to the public that patent protection for
  computer programs is available. Would bring clarity."

 "We expect our line to be twofold:
    * [snip] propose a directive to harmonise national patent laws in the area of
      computer software.
    * The Commission might be prepared to support a revision of the Munich
      Convention to improve it and to make it clear that computer programmes
      are no longer excluded from patent protection."

Software-Patente
	
 Über die Patentierbarkeit von Computersoftware ist in Europa in den letzten Jahren intensiv diskutiert worden. Teile der europäischen Wirtschaft sind der  
 Auffassung, dass Patente auf diesem Gebiet die Innovation fördern könnten, da sie einen angemessenen Schutz bieten angesichts der beträchtlichen Summen 
 und Ressourcen, die die Entwicklung leistungsfähiger Spezialsoftware erfordern kann.
 
  Zahlreiche mittelständische Unternehmen wiederum sind der Meinung, dass Patente den fairen Wettbewerb untergraben und Innovationen verhindern.

Die Prüfungspraxis des Europäischen Patentamtes unterscheidet zwischen Software "als solcher", für die kein Patentschutz erlangt werden kann, und Software mit "technischem Charakter". Eine Software weist dann einen technischen Charakter auf, wenn
1) die Software selbst ein technisches Problem löst (etwa Steuerungs- und Regelungssysteme) oder
2) bei der Ausführung der Software ein zusätzlicher technischer Effekt auftritt, wobei physikalische Veränderungen in der Hardware, wie sie bei jeder Ausführung von Software auftreten, nicht ausreichen. Neuheit und Erfindungshöhe vorausgesetzt, erkennen die meisten Patentämter solche Software als patentfähig an, die z. B. einen der folgenden zusätzlichen technischen Effekte aufweist:

    * schnellere Ausführungszeiten,
    * höhere Datentransferraten,
    * effektivere Datenspeicherung,
    * höhere Auflösung etwa in der Bildverarbeitung,
    * einfachere Manipulation bei Computergraphiken
    * effektivere Datenkompression,
    * höhere Effektivität eines Datenfilters.

 Bei den von der Richtlinie angesprochenen "computerimplementierten Erfindungen" handelt  
 es sich um solche Erfindungen, deren Ausführung ein Computerprogramm und damit den 
 Einsatz eines Computers erfordern. [..] 

+ invention which are executed with a computer program and thus require the use of a computer
