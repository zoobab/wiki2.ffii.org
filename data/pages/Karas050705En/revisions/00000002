Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Dear Colleagues! After this two hours
of debate does anyone have the impression that we have a usable common
position? After this debate does anyone have the impression that 
this tricky question has been debated enough, that it is ripe for 
decision, that we do have the necessary qualified majority for Yes or 
to the plenitude of amendments? I do not think so. And there is a reason for that.

The first reading on 24 September 2004 was not taken into account at 
all when it came to the political agreement of the council. Piia-Noora 
Kauppi said on the council decision, apparently the council wanted 
to ignore the will of the elected european legislators. The council
itself is not secure. The item had been removed from the agenda
on 21 December on the request of Poland. Parliaments in Germany,
Spain and the Netherlands have spoken against the directive in 
its current form. Votings have been delayed several times.

The European Parliament has asked the Commision for a resubmittal
in First Reading. We have a decision of the Legal Affairs Council
(JURI), a decision of the Conference of Presidents, a decision 
of the plenary for a renewed referral.

How did the council react on that? The council has stopped 
all discussion by declaring it A item hence quenching all
discussions. Even if the Nice treaty become law in the meanwhile 
the political agreement was simply approved. Result: one is unhappy
about the common position and we now have 178 amendments.

From the subject matter point of view --- I could amend it - they are mentioned 
in the amendments --- I am convinced this common position does not 
create legal security, it does not promote innovation and it gives
fear to the small companies. Hence it is wise to reject the 
common position next and use all our forces for the harmonisation 
of European Patent law instead for voting on disputed sectoral
harmonisations as substitute for that.
