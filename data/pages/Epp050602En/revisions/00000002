''2nd June 2005 -- One day after a conference that was jointly organised by FFII, CCIA and a group of members of parliament from the European People's Party from mostly Eastern-European countries, the German Christian Democrats conducted a hearing of their own on "CII", in which they gave the floor mainly to pro-patent lobbyists and patent lawyers.''

== Notes ==

The notes attempt to paraphrase too much of was said, even the very
unimportant stuff. They need to be improved.

=== MEP Kauppi, EPP rapporteur ===

 * most difficult case in her 6 years.
 * meps agree - don't want to take too many steps backward - inventions, using software as part of the invention should be patentable.
 * but situation not clear enough. some v bad patents granted.
 * close to the status quo ?
   * EPC ?
   * EPO case law ?
 * Kauppi means the case law, not strict interpretation from 1970s. world has moved on; should not go back.
 * Patent convention is outdated; should have been changed.
 * Outcome: most EPP/DE members want to conserve status quo, with some limitations to stop business methods, trivial patents.
 * some definitions redundant, more text does not mean more clarity.  Need to limit to core issues, remove material which just gives room for lawyers to interpret.

=== Robert Lind - not available. ===

=== Alain Strowel, Liege. ===

 * Economic studies:  inconclusive.
   * so need to remain prudent: we don't know, so we need to remain reasonable
 * Cumulation: software is a hybrid
   * text:  literary aspects
   * code:  functional aspects
 * hybrid nature -> protection by different IP rights (cf 
   * copyright: the
   * patent: protects the functional ideas.
   * sometimes the value of a solution will lie in the technical ideas.
 * eurolinux: protection should protect investment
   * investment in writing the code
   * ''also'' investment in developing new technical features.
 * Legal
   * whatever the outcome, there will be another judge, the ECJ - we should trust in this judge.
     * trademarks, database protection: ECJ has been cautious
   * key areas:	
     * Art 2-4: "technical contribution" does not confer legal certainty. -- misled
     * Art 5: "product claims"			
**** won't allow 
**** "pure software is software without technical contribution"
     * technical contribution
**** don't need new
**** ABS
**** Washing machine 
**** replacement of hardware element by software not good enough ?
**** Mobile phone - faster access to data ?
   * exclusion of "data processing" is "extreme"
   * definitions of industry 
     * production of material goods
     * EU does not have competitive advantage there.

=== Brian Kahin, University of Michigan ===

 * status quo ?
   * real status quo
     * hard to tell: what is the real issue ?
   * Commission missing context material
     * different uses; complex products
     * portfolios, not single patents
     * "patents are stealing our copyrights"
     * patent trolls.
     * TI doesn't know what's in its portfolio
     * Cisco doesn't do clearance searches
 * Software
   * widespread independent invention
   * inadvertent infringement
 * "Pure software"
   * what do you want to keep out of the directive ?
 * What's at stake ?
   * is it about patents or about software ?
   * patents or innovation ?
   * knowledge-based economy ?
		
== Karamandi, EPO ==

 * What is patentable, what is not ?
 * Directive should not move too far from status quo.
 * Current practice in 8 minutes:
   * EPC, 30 member states
   * EPO BoA case law
   * Art 52(1) EPC:
   * Art 52(2) and 52(3) EPC:
     * ... exclusions
     * should be interpreted narrowly.
     * only excluded if claimed "as such"
   * "Invention"
     * should it be defined ?
     * member states said no
     * prep docs 70s said flexibility should remain, to consider new technology.
 * epo case law
   * technical character
   * -> else excluded from patentability
   * -> computer programs, business methods claimed as such
   * -> inventions involving computer programs patentable if they make a technical contribution.
 * US
   * concrete, tangible, useful result
   * state street bank
			
== PA Betten, Ficpi ==

 * patent lawyer 20 years, previously programmer
   * represent small SMEs -- innovative.
   * good we don't have US system, won't have those problems
     * technical character.
 * Copyright doesn't protect against intelligent copying.
   * works for global cos, global open source
     * but not good for small cos
     * doesn't work for small
**** Microsoft vs Stac case
**** C didn't protect SMEs
**** now SMEs can use patents to protect themselves
 * Open source / SMEs
   * DE: 3.4 million SMEs
   * some open source
   * some services
   * but the others do make products which can be patentable
   * want to sell these worldwide
   * 1 to 2 patents can get a worldwide foothold.
   * "hidden champions"
     * EU companies that have achieved 30 to 40% shares.
 * major infringement proceedings ?
   * then why haven't those 30,000 led to proceedings ?
   * despite existing patent protection,
   * innovation has not been slowed down before.
 * The important case law from the EPO, BGH
   * -> patent protection for business methods etc not possible.
   * EPO manages without a definition of "technical"
     * -- nor does BGH
 * recitals 
   * [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papiere/bgh-komm04/|decision from 2004]] better than any new definition of technical characteristic which would only confuse
   * experts happy with 3(b)
 * Fears of Open Source, SMEs 
   * large areas of software not patentable
   * don't have technical character
   * case law changed in 2000
     * .. many would not be enforceable
 * Council version would speed up
   * clarifications by ECJ
     * (though took 10 years).
		
== Q&A ==

=== Q. MEP Wuermeling: ===

 * v useful, comprehensive statements.
 * "data processing"
   * what would it mean to exclude this from patentability ?
   * would this help separate software from technical areas.
		
=== A. Stowel: ===

 * exclusion of all data processing
   * would move the limit a long way from the current position
 * data processing should be patentable
   * enhancement of the image in medical equipment
   * physical entities on the screen.
			
=== Q. MEP Lehne: ===

 * all colleagues agree on the objective:
   * software developers able to work without limits
   * but allow inventors to profit
 * interoperability:
   * solution ?
		
=== A. PA Betten: ===
	
 * 1991: chamber of patent lawyers intervened on sw copyright, interfaces
   * that compromise was very difficult
   * has stayed in place
   * still a major component of patent law
 * with the exception of Microsoft, no specific cases where this has become a problem.
   * but an issue which will seriously have to be addressed over next 3 years
     * German courts have indicated this.
		
=== Q.  MEP Kauppi, EPP: ===

 * can software have some technical features ?
 * data processing not a field of technology ?
   * could this be limited to make it okay ?
 * Betten: were EPO decisions right, eg IBM/ program claims, Sohei ?
   * --> kauppi: borderline cases ?
		
=== A.  Brian Kahin: ===

 * comment on Betten statement ?
 * US would not put so much weight behind a single adjective "technical"
		
=== A.  Stowell ===

 * technical features can be implemented in software, eg code.
   * but then it is the invention which is patented, not the code ?
   * -> sim to biotech invention.
   * --> it is the function which is patentable.
 * exclude data processing without limitation goes very far
   * would exclude image contribution
 * but excluding data processing w/o technical contribution could be okay.
 * rust in a good judge at the ECJ
	
== A.  PA Betten: ==

 * of course, technical features can be implicit in code
   * -> what matters is the effect it brings about.
 * EPO jurisprudence, BGH is far clearer than this general form of words.
 * Product claim:
 * US form of words might have been preferable.
   * but we are talking about the code as it is marketed.
   * IBM computer program product, federal court agreed.
   * especially important for SMEs in particular
   * otherwise would have to take action against end user.
   * confusion: covers product in the form in which it is marketed
     * all the characteristics of the patentable product/device.
			
===  A. Karamani: ===

 * Case law:
 * "normal physical effect"
   * flow of electric current not a 
   * brake or train, better quality mobile phone comms.
   * solution to a technical problem
   * IBM decision, Sohei at the beginning of the case law
   * new case law has developed
   * much emphasis on whether there is a technical contribution
   * very strict criteria now
   * this has changed
   * our practice has changed,
   * we are now more restrictive.
 * Data processing:
   * Dangerous to create broad exclusion
   * might not be able to support the SME the way you would like to do.
   * Instrument of interpretation, not an instrument for introducing to
			
=== Kauppi: ===

 * Program product claims, and Sohei are exactly what we want to exclude.
 * This is just what most MEPs want to exclude.
 * Very disappointed you were not able to exclude these.
	
=== A. Karamani. ===

 * Hardware replaced by software
   * excluding these would not be
 * IBM is not now followed.
 * Hitachi is the line.
 * pure sw product will very rarely solve a technical problem.
 * new case law has a better approach
 * is there really a technical problem to be solved?
 * parl wants the innovation to be protected if it is a technical innovation, not a software innovation.
	
=== A.  PA Betten. ===

 * Earlier ruling did not much look at whether
   * 1st hurdle: tech character
   * 2nd hurdle: inventive step.
 * current jurisprudence says patents before 2000, not necessarily sound.
	
=== Q. Oliver Lorenz ===

 * Bad patents have been granted
 * You say, "Criteria of technical effect"
 * What was technical effect in progress bar, shopping cart, internet shopping method ?
 * To Kahin: is solution
	
=== Q. Joachim Jacobs, FSFE ===

 * Microsoft suit
 * An empty victory to publish information, if it is not patented
	
=== Q. Alessandra Rossi ===

 * New judge '' ECJ '' new lines of case law:
 * Isn't litigation a very costly way to get rid of patents which shouldn't have been granted in the first place ?
 * "Further technical effect":
   * given that any program is meant to produce some effect, is there any program which does not produce a further technical effect ?
		
=== Q. Marco Schultz: ===

 * (regarding Betten Stac) s/w would not be patentable, yet software patents would have been useful against Microsoft ?
   * does this add up ?
 * as an SME, I need law to be clear -- otherwise I face a very expensive situation, puts my company at risk -- law must be clear, not left to court.
	
=== Q.  Birgitte Anderssen ===

 * SMEs fail because not protected.
 * But all international studies show SMEs are threatened, because they are less able to participate in the game
	
=== Q. Alberto Barrionuevo ===

 * Status quo: Q to Mrs Kauppi
 * According to the slides, status quo could be patent convention, or current practice
 * Should EPO have legislative powers as well as executive?
	
=== Q. Erik Josefsson: ===

 * "Computer program excluded as such"
   * a computer program for executing a method under any of the previous claims.

=== A. Brian Kahin ===
		
 * discomfort at focus on "technical"
   * poorly drawn lines go away, end up with no limit at all.
   * need to make contact with economic reality, or law will not hold.
		
=== A.	Strowel ===

 * this directive is about finding a line between patentable and not.
 * there are issues for SMEs - more in the US than here
 * adjustments are needed, (eg reduced fees for SMEs)
   * but this is not the issue here.
 * why aren't oppositions being introduced ?
		
=== A.  Betten ===

 * progress bar
   * IS of a technical nature, if it indicates something about the hardware.
   * would not stop use eg of a clock which was filling up.
 * shopping cart
   * not a contribution today, any more
 * Microsoft STAC case -- innovative storage was technical.
 * SMEs: Fraunhofer inst study
   * a proportion of SMEs do need patents
   * these are the ones that have produced most innovations, jobs
 * Program claims:
   * Only if it can be traced back to a patentable procedure (eg IBM case).

=== A. Karamanli: ===

 * misconception - further technical effect is needed.
   * second hurdle, is there technical contribution ?
   * shopping method - if the object does not contain a solution to a technical problem, then no; but yes, if it does contain such a solution.
   * can't just say "shopping methods" cannot be patented.
   * interpretation by courts
     * laws must be written with as much certainty as possible
     * but case law made by courts is inevitable
     * - interpretation of laws.
   * directive is a means of interpretation
   * concern is reasonable, but this is an issue for many laws.
 * program claim:
   * claim to a computer program
     * Erik: not "as such" ??
     * no, because a claim to a computer program which would have a further technical effect.

=== MEP Kauppi: ===

 * interpretation by courts is a reality
 * this is a good thing
 * legislators can always come back again: nothing is definitive and final.
	
=== Kai Brandt, Siemens ===

 * some more examples for the discussion:
   * software controlled fuel injection to minimise consumption
   * offshore wind energy
   * motion control and factory automation
   * because the software is better
   * medical equipment
   * X-ray tomography scanners
   * different amounts of radiation control.
   * image processing
   * could do it in hardware; or in a software workstation
   * --> protect the CD which is inserted
 * co-operation with university
   * professors publish
   * so must have patents.
   * Technical CIIs.
   * Excluding physical measurement processes ?
	
=== Lauri Kvinenen, Nokia ===

 * CII directive does
 * misconception: that a clear dividing line can be drawn between tangible and intangible.
 * companies want clarity, and an even playing field.
 * proprietary software needs patent protection
   * so we can know that we own it.
 * second reading:
   * needs to be balanced, ...
   * acknowledge existing patent legislation
   * do not define something which is probably undefinable.
   * recognise that interoperability has different meanings in different sectors
   * telecoms has huge amount of interoperability
   * do not include catch-all definitions which exclude all data processing.
 * Open source and proprietary software can co-exist.

=== David Axmark,  MySQL: ===

...
	
=== Lycos Europe: ===

 * develop many products
 * biggest hurdle to enter the US market is software patents.
 * rough scan:  $1m per year, just to review key opponents patent portfolios
 * we would need to file a lot of patents ourselves
 * which would cost money, contribute nothing
	
=== Q.  Kauppi: ===

 * can definition of "data processing" be improved ?
 * axmark - EPO patents on pure data processing on databases ?
	
=== Q. Lehne: ===

 * software developers should not be limited
 * but we swould be shooting ourselves in the foot if ABS braking etc not patentable
 * Would Rocard's amendments really prevent this ?
	
=== A. Brandt: ===

 * "forces of nature"
   * raises the same problem
   * washing machine patentable, but improvement
		
=== Q.  Joachim Jacobs: ===

 * Siemens patent on HTML mediated business information
	
=== A.  Brandt:  ===

 * I don't know the patent
   * might be technical
   * might not be technical,
 * if we are exploring what is allowed and what is not
   * sometimes then we get granted patents, we wish had not been granted.
 * forces of nature does not cover all cases where things are technical (according to BGH)
   * and moving electrons is forces of nature
   * granted even if we dont want it.

=== MEP Mayer, EPP ===

Interest Groups:

 * 75,000 emails to German MEPs in two weeks.
   * a sort of lobbying that we could do without.
	
	
===  Oliver Lorenz, Emcita ===

 * support from companies, and in the public interest.
 * remarks to what had been said earlier:
 * agreement here that  CIIs = software patents
 * "you may also call it a blue elephant" -- it's all the same thing
 * patent attorneys would prefer "technical" not to be defined too tightly
   * but they would say that, wouldn't they.
 * Judge yesterday at a conference in Germany:
   * forces of nature is __very__ important
   * it was abandoning that criterion that let in all these trivial patents
   * should listen to judges, not just attorneys.
 * points:
   * Patent rights are property rights.
     * we grant these as a society
     * it is for society not the EPO to make these rules
 * No help for knowledge sharing
   * -> pre-emptive strike on knowledge sharing
		
=== UEAPME ===

 * monopolies for non-EU companies
 * block on innovation, huge financial costs.
	   
=== ACEA ===

 * Frederik Egrelius (Scania)
 * European Automotive Manufacturers Association
 * Vehicle internal computer network
   * may link up to 80 processors
   * these are all about data processing
 * "Exclusion of data processing" is therefore unacceptable.
 * eg
 * Sensors  ->  Computer  ->  Brakes
   * improvement maybe implemented solely as a computer program
   * new method is certainly a technical
 * "forces of nature" would only relate to the mechanical features.
   * no reason to restrict to those sorts of inventions
	
=== Hugo Lueders, CompTIA ===

 * [[CompTiaEn| CompTIA]]
 *  Europe is in crisis again
   * need a clear signal that we believe in internal market, harmonisation
 *  There is still the idea that you can develop sw for free, or for small investment
   * but it is very capital intensive
   * and designing the technical features is the most capital intensive part
     * this is what needs the protection.
 *  Don't take away the lifeblood for this part of the industry
   * don't take away the innovation
 *  Parliament don't go to conciliation -- risk is that the whole directive will disappear.
  
=== Q.  MEP Kauppi: ===
  
 * Patent lawyers don't want clarity on technical:
   * because it's impossible ?
   * or because you want to leave it broad ?
 * ASEA: data processing ?
   * If it's just darts processing, normal input output, databases, whole invention with further technical effect
   * could this then be used to exclude pure software ?
  			
=== A.  Hugo Lueders, CompTIA: ===
  
 * don't open Pandora's box with wonderful new ideas.
   * this would not add anything to the clarity
   * you would destroy what we have
 * forces of nature
   * Japan has "forces of nature"
   * allows software patents
 * avoid conciliation
   * otherwise other companies will take it away from us
  		
  		
=== A.  ACEA: ===
  	
 * "technical" should be defined as
   * "industrial application of exact sciences"
   * we have no good solution to improve that sentence.
  	
=== A.  Cimaglia ===
 
 * "Apply the law to enemies, interpret the law for friends".
 	
 	
=== A.  Lorenz, EMCITA ===
 
 * surrounded by products, not programs
 * not necessary that every innovation should have a patent
   * only if it would have happened without the patent.
 		
=== MEP Lehne: summary ===

 * my view, won't please everybody
 * EPP-ED members agree on what we want
   * developers' room for manoevre should not be limited
   * but system for patents up until now, principles must be maintained
     * esp industrial patents
 * --> so how can we achieve that objective ?
   * today was to clarify.
   * nobody could argue with those interests.
 * 260 amendments.  vote 21 july in JURI.
   * v difficult, esp at second reading
   * yet 75,000 emails on this question - doing our best to answer!
     * doesn't necessarily help!!  
     * counterproductive (ATTAC apologised).
     * exerting pressure, members not getting balanced info
     * power games being played.
 * Within the EPP, there are major differences regarding Rocard report
   * I and many others believe it is questioning the entire patent system as it exists
   * patents are a fundamental building block in the knowledge economy. we don't want to dismantle it.
 * Impressions:
   * only one argument
     * common position said s/w cannot be patented
     * I couldn't see why that was problematic
   * need to find compromise, solution everyone can accept, without introducing additional damage.
 * EU system is different from USA.
   * Patents enormously important for SMEs
     * machine tools,
     * automotive component mfrs
   * enormous interest in maintaining patentablity
     * eg robot control system - still patentable ?
     * would be disastrous if not patentable.
     * from Ruhr:
**** SMEs would not accept such an opinion.
   * Interoperability is of central importance
     * Need better solution than what has been raised in council.
     * Need clear legal provision
     * nobody wants to see unclear rules.
   * Any rule or law requires interpretation
     * this is for the courts.
     * (J. Jakobs interjection: "unclear rules mean money for lawyers")
     * --> not job creation schemes
   * Horrified by unobjective way debate is conducted
     * sometime seems not to be lobbyists, seem to be from sects
     * interested parties only seem to view things from their own points of view
     * no use to us
     * need solutions
   * We will do our utmost to find a political compromise
     * otherwise we will have to look at majorities at vote in July
     * don't know how things would fall
   * those in favour of a radical solution need to have a compromise
 * -->  Conciliation
   * will make sure the situation won't be worse than it is at the moment.
   * But if conciliation fails, current jusrisprudence would continue
     * -> not in the interest of those who want to limit patentability.
