''On May 26th 2005, a conference on software patents took place at the University of Verona. The meeting was co-organised by the University of Verona and FFII.  Ante Wessels, speaking for FFII, explained that the Council needs a strong counter-point from the Parliament in order to be able to find a Common Position that really represents its members' will.  There were about 50 people, mostly students, some smes, a petition was signed. Gregorio Piccoli, a representative of Zucchetti, a company with 1500 employees, spoke out against software patents.''

Organization was done by Davide Quaglia !PhD and Prof Vittorio Murino of Verona University.

FFII thanks Lorenzo Grespan, who took the initiative for this all.

== Piccoli speech ==

Piccoli made a nice joke: he said Einstein used to work for the Patent Office, but since then quality has dropped.

== Dalle Vedove ==

Professor Giampaolo Dalle Vedove, University of Verona, expressed his doubts about software patents.

== Ante Wessels: Council is talking about software patents directive again ==

Ante Wessels of FFII/Vrijschrift mentioned the fact that the Council is talking about the software patents directive too again, at the end:

  "What most people don't know, the directive is at the moment also being
  discussed in the Council. The Council is talking with the European
  Parliament. What position should the Council take? And, what position
  should members of the Council, like the Italian government, take? The
  Council reached an outspoken common position, in which it does not believe
  any more. There were parliamentary motions in the Netherlands, Germany and
  Poland, there are seven unilateral declarations. The Council should not
  support its common position. Without strong European Parliament amendments
  an extreme directive will become law, an extreme directive in which the
  Council itself does not believe any more. The council has to stimulate the
  European Parliament to make clear amendments to prevent this, to keep the
  lawmaking process going. Without this, within a few months we will have an
  extreme directive."
