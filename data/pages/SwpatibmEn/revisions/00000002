 For instance, Unisys had a patent governing a bit of the algorithm used for GIF images. In general, patents are a huge  
 weakness for a standard. The MP3 standard is used very widely by people who simply don't know -- or don't care -- that someone 
 theoretically has a patent on part of it, and only some code using the patented algorithm actually has a license from the 
 patent holder. Developers and users can be bitten by this many years after they make the design decision to use a patented 
 algorithm, due to the nature of patents (see Resources). De jure standards often require contributors to clearly disclose any 
 known patents; de facto standards generally have no way to do this.

! Bruce Perens attacks IBM

And yet, a pro-software patent agenda is being pursued by some of the largest and best partners we have in the Linux industry. IBM stands out in this regard. Obviously, IBM has done a lot for our community, and the very fact that IBM endorses our systems and distributes them so well to our many customers has helped us gain the economic significance that gets us taken seriously by standards organizations and legislators. At the same time, we have frequently found IBM taking an adversary position, one harmful to the open source developers, in patent policy discussions at standards organizations, and at governments here and abroad. There's no question that IBM is one of the major parties supporting the effort to expand software patenting to Europe. So we're at the point, in the progress of open source, where we realize that we have very good friends who can still hurt us in significant ways if we don't push back against them. We must push back, or we will simply not survive the upcoming legal onslaught. 

The fact is, none of our company partners other than Red Hat have even given us any assurance that we are safe from their own patents. IBM and HP, when confronted, have pointed out that they haven't sued any free software developers. We all know how frequently company managements change and we lose our friend in the front office. Thus, I'd sleep better if I could see something on paper that spells out just what sort of armistice we have with IBM, HP, and others.
