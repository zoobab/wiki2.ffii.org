= MEPs are in your country during a home week =

----

MEPs not only rotate between Brussels where they are most of the time, and Strasbourg (ca 1 week / month), but they also have home weeks (also called "constituency week", that is they are in their home country and place) to care for local issues and local persons. Note that the home weeks are often at a time where there are also national holidays, please respect that when trying to arrange a meeting. Of course, many MEPs also are in their home countries on the weekends or when other circumstances require this. It is also admitted that the home week concept is less exciting if you happen to live in or near Brussels or Strasbourg anyway.

Upcoming home weeks:

 * 2005-02-07..11
 * 2005-03-21..25
 * 2005-05-16..20
 * 2005-11-01..04

In the [http://www.europarl.eu.int/plenary/cal2005_en.pdf calendar (pdf)], home weeks are in yellow (in case you are interested: the dark-red plenary session weeks are in Strasbourg, the light-red committee meeting weeks and blue group meeting weeks mostly in Brussels).
