''Brussels (22 September 2005) Florian Mueller, the founder of the [[http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com|NoSoftwarePatents.com]] campaign, has been nominated for the most prestigious award in EU politics, the "EV50 Europeans of the Year". The campaigner, who successfully opposed an EU directive on software patents, now has the chance to become "EU Campaigner of the Year" or even the overall "European of the Year".''

The European Voice, a major EU-focused weekly, today started an Internet                                                                                                  poll in which Mueller runs against such celebrities as Bono Vox (U2), Bob Geldof, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, and political leaders including British prime minister Tony Blair and German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The poll is open to the public at this address: http://www.ev50.com/poll/                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                         
In a first reaction, Mueller said that he is "honored by this nomination", but he was quick to share the glory: "I really owe this to all activists and citizens who supported our cause, especially to the FFII (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure)". Mueller has previously been listed among the "top 50 most influential people in intellectual property" by Managing Intellectual Property magazine:                                                                                                                                          
http://www.managingip.com/default.asp?page=9&PubID=198&SID=525600&ISS=17456&LS=EMS47649                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                         
Software patent critics are also pleased to see that Michel Rocard, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the software patent directive, has been nominated for the "MEP of the Year" award. On 6 July, an overwhelming majority of MEPs voted 648-32 against the EU Council's proposal for a "directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions".                                                                                                      Campaigners like Mueller and the FFII were worried that the proposed legislation would have given software patents a much stronger legal status in Europe.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                         
The FFII's Brussels representative, Erik Josefsson, was among the first to congratulate: "I'm extremely proud that Florian Mueller and Michel Rocard have been nominated because they represent countless European citizens who are concerned over software patents. Hopefully many will vote for the two, so that Europe's political leaders fully appreciate the importance of our cause."                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                         
Stefan Zickgraf, the managing director of leading SME organization CEA-PME, said: "We are very happy about Florian Mueller's nomination because we worked very closely and successfully with him and the FFII. The way in which small and medium-sized businesses took political action against software patents is unprecedented in Brussels, and the result should encourage all SMEs to play a more active political role in the future." CEA-PME (Confédération Européenne des Associations de Petites et Moyennes Entreprises) is the Brussels-based umbrella organization of 22 member associations from 19 European countries, representing in total more than 500,000 small and medium-sized enterprises.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                         
The EV50 winners will be announced on 29 November. A gala evening at the                                                                                                  Palais d'Egmont in Brussels will be hosted by former European Parliament President Pat Cox. The EV50 awards are supported by Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt.
