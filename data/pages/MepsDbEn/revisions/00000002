The FFII has is maintaining a database of members of the European Parliament.  Here we document the structure of this database, so as to facilitate its maintenance.

== News & Chronology ==

 * 2004-11-01 phm creates this page in an effort to document the database structure a bit better so as to facilitate integration of the new data
 * 2004-08-00 amacfie creates new set of data for newly elected parliament
 * 2003-00-00 the database is intensively used in the My MEP application of [[AktivEn| aktiv]]
 * 2002-00-00 created on basis of a script by Chema from CALIU which harvested data from the EP website, 

== Getting started ==

As with other databases on FFII, you can most conveniently access them if you have a ssh account with needed access rights on the database.  For rights on 'meps', you may want to contact mepdb-help at ffii org.

Assuming you have a user account named 'jonas', a typical command for accessing through an ssh tunnel might be:

 $ ssh -p 50022 -L 3333:ffii.org:5432 jonas@ffii.org

See ssh documentation for more details.  You would then, in another session on your home machine which has the postgres client 'psql' installed, enter something like

 $ psql -d meps -h localhost -p 3333

For other postgres clients (e.g. from within Perl or Emacs) the invocation is similar: you mainly substitute 3333 (or some other arbitrary port that happens to be available for use on your machine) for the normal dbport number which usually is 5432.

== Outline ==

 * Some level of description of the syntax can be found in
   * genba:/var/www/ffii/verein/verbdefs.txt
