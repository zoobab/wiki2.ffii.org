[[ChristophThenEn| Christoph Then]]: "The Office did not admit the possibility of appealing to the next-higher level.  That would have been the Enlarged Board of Appeal.  Thereby the situation is now legally inextricable, because the legal basis has been de facto put out of force."

[[HartmutPilchEn| Hartmut Pilch]]: "The wording tricks by which the EPO sidesteps its statutory law are the same which it uses to justify software patents.  It just pretends that the law excludes only narrow claims to the object in questions but allows broad claims which cover the same object.  Also, as in the software patent case, the Technical Board of Appeal is deciding alone and the Enlarged Board of Appeal, which is more authoritative in matters of interpretation of law, is not consulted.  The powerholders in the EPO are thereby bypassing not only the law but also their own semi-independent judicial institutions."
