= Worse climate with software patents, says small study investigating IT-companies in Sweden =

A new master thesis titled "(while) waiting for software patents" (I väntan på mjukvarupatent)
from the Economic School at Gothenburg University includes a survey of Swedish IT-companies with regards to software patents. 

The results are similar to the larger German study Ifis050404En .

45 companies have been asked about software patents:

 - Do you think competition will be better(grow?) or worse with software patents?
   62% worse, 12% better, 26% dont know

 - Do you see possibilities with software patents?
   No 44%, Yes 24%, Dont know 38%

 - Do you run your own software development?
   Yes 85%, No 15%

 - have you heard about software patents?
   Yes 91%, No 9%

 - Have you looked into software patents?
   Yes 26%, No 62%, Dont know 12% 

 - ...

The thesis concludes that everyone believes that software patents will come. (???)
That uncertainty and lack of knowledge in the market is not good...
