 * http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/copyright/review/consultation_en.htm
 * No extension of legal protection for copy protection measures to software, would override interoperability
 * such legal protection should apply only to circumvention for the purpose of infringing copyright (?)
 * No extension of copyright term, public domain is a Good Thing, perpetual copyright discourages creativity
 * PD of public goods enables business value by alternative systems ((such as Gauss is better and cheaper than the EPO-Espacenet)) -- PD enables commercial exploitation while protecting public data makes no sense.
 * PD <> "public property"  -- Gemeinfreiheit ist nicht Gemeineigentum
