[[http://www.cea-pme.org/|CEA-PME]] (association of more than 500,000 european SMEs), ObjectWeb (consortium of large french companies), FFII (60000 supporters, 1000 companies) and some members of national parliaments have teamed up to call on
EU member state governments to reverse the EU Competiveness Council's decision of 2004-05-18.

It is unusual for the governments to do this, but in the current case it seems clear that there
is no real qualified majority behind the decision, and, as EU law advisors of FFII [[ConsReversEn| note]], there
is no legal reason why heads of state should not reverse this decision.
