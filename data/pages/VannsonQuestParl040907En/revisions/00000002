In response to our Urgent Appeal, François Vannson (UMP) (French MP, from same majority as President Chirac) has filed a written question to the French Minister of Research:

 Mr. François Vannson draws the attention of Mr. minister delegated to research on
 the concerns of professionals caused by the position adopted by France on the Council
 of European Union, last 18th of May, actually favorable to an unlimited patentability
 and an applicability without obstacle of the patents on the algorithms and business
 methods "implemented by computer" in Europe. The formulas rhetorics used by the proposed
 text actually introduce an unlimited patentability whose consequences can be prejudicial
 for the innovation, the competitivity and the growth of the informational economy.
 Furthermore, the consequences of this directive can be more serious for the independence
 of the States in general and France in particular whereas an electronic administration
 must be developped thanks to the use of Internet and free softwares. Indeed, a
 patentability with the contexts of appreciation and application as broad as those proposed
 will slow down the noncommercial software developments allowing the independence of the
 States compared to the established editors. Taking into account the exposed elements, he
 kindly requests to him to indicate if France hopes to be opposed to this proposal.
