Describe the new page here.Hello. I noticed a few small mistakes in "The Myths - The Truth" at
http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/amccarthy030901/index.en.html
as follows:

In the introduction: "championning" should be "championing".

In 1.1: "unkown" should be "unknown".

In 1.2: "anti-blocking system" is more commonly written as "anti-lock braking
system". (I didn't understand what the former phrase referred to until I
saw "ABS".)

In 1.4: "proosals" should be "proposals".

In 1.5: "Myth: Programmes and ISPs will be regularly sued" should
perhaps have a "[sic]" added.

In 1.5: "infringment" should be "infringement".

In sections 1.2 and 1.6, paragraph breaks in the "truth" quotations have
somehow been turned into colons.

In 1.6: "mputer-implemented" should be "computer-implemented" as in the
original.

In 1.6: "enforcable" should be "enforceable".

In 1.7: "moroever" should be "moreover".

In 1.8: "innnovation" should be "innovation".

In 1.8: "ecnonomic" should be "economic".

In 1.8: "accross" should be "across".


Thanks for your hard work campaigning, and the best of luck,
