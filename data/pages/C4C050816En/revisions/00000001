''Campaign for Creativity, an astroturf campaign from the UK, reviews its strategy. 2004-2005 C4C failed to convince members of the European Parliament in the Software Patents debate. It's astroturfing tactics were criticized by lobby watch organisations. Now C4C describes its future mission as a containment strategy for growing opposition "against intellectual property" on the international level.''

== Scenario according to C4C  ==

Simon Gentry is rallying support by making claim that
certain unnamed groups which are allegedly opposed to all "intellectual
property" and in particular to all patents, are becoming a growing
threat to his constituency:

  "The groups opposed to intellectual property rights, and 
  patents in particular, are increasingly influential and 
  active at national, European and global levels. Drawn 
  from a range of ideological backgrounds, some oppose IP
  because they oppose the concept of private property and
  believe that IP is "the privatisation of ideas". Others
  believe that IP hampers competition and reinforces the
  position of large companies. Others believe that IP acts 
  against the "common good", particularly in the field of 
  medicines. They are forging links, networking and building 
  alliances with the media, academics, government officials 
  and politicians. Their influence is increasingly apparent 
  in the political debate in national capitals, in Brussels 
  and in international fora such as the World Intellectual 
  Property Organisation and the World Trade Organisation."
