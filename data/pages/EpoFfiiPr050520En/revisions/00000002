''Brussels, 20 May 2005 -- The FFII in conjunction with the European Patent Office (EPO) is pleased to announce it is co-hosting a new conference on EU software patent policy entitled "''!SMEs/, software, copyright and patents" to be held on Tuesday May 24th. Exploring the experiences and expectations of/ !SMEs ''with regard to patents on computer-implemented innovations, the event will consist of two panels of involved'' !SMEs ''together with representatives of the EPO discussing this vital issue.''

Jonas Maebe, Board Member of the FFII, comments:

 "By holding its first ever Information Day in the European Parliament
  earlier this year, the European Patent Office clearly demonstrated
  its willingness to openly present and discuss its policy goals and
  views. They are continuing this trend by organising, together with
  the FFII, an event where stakeholders will talk about how they make
  their business profitable, what they desire from the patent system
  and what experiences they have had."

The programme is as follows:

Panel 1: "Business models in the software industry: importance of
various types of intellectual property rights" will discuss the
various ways in which software companies can protect investment.

''Chair'': Ms Theodora Karamanli, European Patent Office
 * Speaker 1:	Mr Joao Neves, Intraneia  
 * Speaker 2: 	Mr Andrea Nikolai, T6 
 * Speaker 3: 	Mr Daniel Doll-Steinberg, Tribeka 


Panel 2: "Software, copyrights and patents: what impact do they have
on stakeholders?" will look at copyrights and patents in particular
and will focus on experiences that companies have had using these
systems, as well as the interaction between the two regimes.

''Chair'': Mr David Hammerstein MEP (the Greens)
 * Speaker 1:	Mr Pieter Hintjens, iMatix 
 * Speaker 2: 	Mr Håkon Wium Lie, Opera Software 
 * Speaker 3: 	Mr Jean-Paul Smets,  Nexedi
