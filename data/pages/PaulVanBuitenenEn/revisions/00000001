Mr. van Buitenen became well known internationally as the whistleblower who exposed large scale corruption throughout the European Commission, leading to its collective resignation in 1999. 

Believing that the situation in the Commission has hardly improved since then, he founded the party '''Europa Transparant''', a European party dedicated to establishing and safeguarding honesty, integrity, and openness in the European Decision Making Process. In the European elections of 2004, they obtained two seats.

Europa Transparant insists on being "politically neutral" and argues that its objectives are desirable by both the political "Left" and "Right".

As such, this party won't take an official stance on the software patent issue itself. However, Paul van Buitenen is definitely interested in investigating the undemocratic and apparently illegitimate behaviour that the European Commission, demonstrated when it decided to blatantly ignore the role of the EP.

Everyone who has important '''facts''' with regards to the misbehaviour of the European Commission in this process, as well as details on the active role that the European Patent Office and other influential parties have played therein, is requested to provide him with detailed information.

Van Buitenen assistant Ries Baeten is an advisor of FFII.
