prepare recording/stream?

Three questions below are in French. They should best either be translated or eliminated because they are duplicates.

What kind of idiotic meeting is this? The EPO belongs to the executive branch and is not supposed to take the initiative to spread propaganda for their services with the legislative branch. Yes, they make money with each granted patent, with the destruction of the public domain, and almost approach this as a commercial company. Despicable.

Imagine that a national department of Construction and Housing Oversight starts promoting building permits.

=== Questions for MEPs to ask EPO: ===

 * If the practice of EPO is legal according to EPC, there is no need for a new directive. If it is not, then the EPO is at fault. Which is it?
 * Bill Gates has stated that software patents would bring the software industry to a "complete standstill". What makes the EPO think Bill Gates was wrong?
 * Is it true that one conclusion from the diplomacy conference in 2000 was that there should be a tighter political control of EPO?
 * EPO and the EU are both independent international bodies, created by a treaty. Would you agree you are competing for power and jurisdiction?
 * Which of the Council's Patent Policy Working Group members are working or has worked or has been contracted to work for the EPO, or has a position at the EPO?
 * How does EPO assess quality difference to USPTO
 * Oppositions are very few, is this due to quality or distance to market?
 * How would you clean up if directive rejected? (how will you fix, if Dir rejected)
   * The practice of the EPO is established on the basis of court decisions so there is nothing to change for the EPO if the directive is rejected, we also already conformant to the current text.
 * Is it possible to get an interpretation of CII/Program Claims by the enlarged board of appeal?
 * Economists argue that a higher fee will improve quality.
 * What is the proper name of US Class 705 patents (business method patents) (see [http://www.epip.ruc.dk/presentations/ses6nr3.pdf Stefan Wagner study] )

   * The EPO is not a trade agency
 * How is the democratic control on the EPO?
   * The EPO is controlled by its administrative council in which the member states have their say
 * The logo of EPO info day is saying "idea + patent = innovation". Which economic study supports this conclusion?
 * Does the EPO make the granted patent claims only available as in graphical (non-textual) form? If this is so, then why?
 * Word processing not as technical as sound encoding?
 * How much money do you make?
 * Were you involved in drafting?
 * Does the EPO grant any software patents at all?
 * What is a software patent according to the EPO?
 * Did you abandon the "core theory" to be able to patent software?
 * Why did you abandon the "core theory"?
   * did they ever follow it??
 * Which directive would you like Council "Common Position", not directive, a directive based on European Parliament  first reading of 2003?
 * There is a economic study on the french patent office saying it looses money from rejecting patent applications, is the same true for you?
 * Is it true that the SACEPO and Council IPR group are the same people? Is there an ovelap at all?

 * is patent quality decreasing or increasing?
 * Would you like to be able to run you own opposition procedures, or open up new possibilityos for the public to run opposition procedures?
 * Would you like to introduce new quality controles?
 * Do you have an emergency break? A button "STOP PROCEDURE"? Would you like to have one?
 * Would you need more stringent criteria for patentability? What is your opinion of the EPC?

 * Do you grant software patents?
 * Would you like to grant software patents?
 * Do you think yourself you have a legitimacy problem visavis your "mandate" (to promote innovation)?

 1- We learned yesterday that India has decided to drop the issue of
 software patents from its new law drafted to fulfill its TRIPS-WTO
 obligations.
 This might be considered surprising for a country that is making
 considerable and successful investment to be one of the top software
 economy on the planet.
 How do you explain their choice ?
 
 
 2- According to the FLOSS studies (in Europe and in the USA), Europe
 represent more than 60% on free software development capability in the
 world.  How do you assess the risk of introducing software patents
 for free software.
 
 Given that the cost of proprietary software is several tens of
 thousands each year for the european economy, and more than 10
 thousands for Microsoft alone, have you analysed how you will recoup
 that cost that would largely be saved by the deployment of free
 software in Europe.

 3 - Quote from Bolkestein in the Parliament debate on 23th september
 2003: "The proposed directive does not aim to abolish this EPO
 practice nor to extend it. [..] The proposal [:of :the Commission] seeks
 to harmonise and to clarify; but nothing will become patentable which
 is not already patentable now."
 
 If the practice of EPO is legal according to EPC, there is no need for
 a new directive.  If it is not, then the EPO is at fault.  Which is it ?
 
 Do you consider that EPO practice has evolved over time enough to need
 clarification of EPC ?  If yes what independent economic studies have
 been conducted to justify this evolution, which is now taken as a
 status quo to be enshrined in a new law ?

 4- Could the EPO please give examples of actual patents that would be
 disallowed by the Parliament's version of the software patent
 directive, that the EPO consider would be detrimental, and explain
 what about those patents that really should need patent protection ?

 5 - Patents are like smoking. Smoking costs to the smoker, but the
 smoke is also dangerous for other people who do not smoke.  Similarly
 patents are expensive.  They are expensive for people who get patents,
 but that is their choice.  But they are also expensive for people who
 do not want patents, because they have to deal with the risk of
 infringement suits, whether justified or not, and also to devote time
 and resources to search patent litterature for potential infringement
 risks.
 
 Given the complexity of software, and the low level of required
 investment, compared to hardware production, this has a significant
 impact, as high a 2% of gross income (even when one wins every
 infringement suit), and can kill the weaker companies.  Have you
 assessed that cost over the whole ICT economy ?  How do you intend to
 protect non smoker, while all known proposal are about insurances to
 help smokers buy and light their cigarettes ?

 6 - All empirical studies show that patents are, in the terme of a
 large British investigation, irrelevant for SMEs (except in pharmacy).
 Given the high risk represented by infringement suits, the whole
 patents systems seems to be mostly of negative value to SMEs, even if
 there are a small number of exceptions.
 
 The reactions of most patents bodies is to state that SMEs are
 wrong and should be educated.  Apparently forcibly educated to fit
 your idea of how the economy should work.  How do you reconcile that
 with a liberal view of economic development ?   Why should you,
 administrative body, know better than entrepreneurs who risk their
 personnal asset in their company ?
 
 7 - Do you think it is your place to be lobbying for more patents ?
 Are you being impartial ?  Where is your assessment of the positive
 and negative aspects of patenting.
----
 The purpose of any patent system should be  to promote innovation and thereby
 economic growth and general welfare for the society under consideration. Any
 protection of any individual's or corporation's patent claims should be
 subordinate to that general interest. Therefore, when changing the rules and
 practice for a patent system, the burden of proof that the change is in
 accordance with the overall goal, lies on those who want to introduce the
 change.

 There exist empirical studies that suggest that in the case of software
 patents, there is even __negative__ correlation between patent rate and
 innovation at the firm level, cf.  "The Software Patent Experiment", Robert
 Hunt, James Bessen , Federal Reserve USA, 2004-03-16. 
 (http://www.researchoninnovation.org/swpat.pdf).

 What is EPO's answer to this study? Does there on the other hand exist
 empirical studies that show a postive link between the rate of sowftware
 patents, innovation and economical growth for society as a whole?
----
How do you assess the statements in your invitation?
 Without patents, innovators would be offered no possibility of recouping their investment.
 Without patents, innovators would have no incentive to develop their inventions.
 Without patents, innovation would remain secret.
 Patents promote innovation, technology transfer, investment, consumption, economic growth and jobs. 
----

 * "more patents => more innovation" (knowledge- economy or bureaucracy?) or is this just another classic case of cum hoc ergo propter hoc?

----
"How do EPO asses that the fee-based financiation does not affect the quality of granted patents?"

"Patents create private monopolies and increased bureucracy in exchange for innovation. Are there any research that examines how this affects society? How does one compare the positive effect of increased innovation with the destructive effect of private monopolies and increased bureucracy?"
----
 Bill Gates stated in a memo fourteen years ago that "if people had
 understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas
 were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a
 complete standstill today".

 1. Does the EPO agrees with this view?
 
 2. If the answer to #1 was "yes" (are you sure?), what evidence does
   the EPO have to support this? How does this evidence compare with
   publications and statistics that support the opposite view?
 
 3. In light of the previous question, does the EPO not agree that the
   issue is highly controversial at best? Why does the EPO think that
   might be?
 
 4. Would the EPO briefly describe the interest groups a) in favor and
   b) against the concept of taking out patents on software. Why is it
   that such a large number of SME's oppose/strongly oppose the idea?
 
 5. [ Insert question regarding EPC articles 52(2) and 52(3) here. ]

Is there a difference between "software is not patentable as such" and "ideas of software are patentable"? Y/N/Abs

Quote from Bolkestein in the Parliament debate on 23th september 2003: "The proposed directive does not aim to abolish this [EPO] practice nor to extend it. [..] The proposal [:of :the Commission] seeks to harmonise and to clarify; but *nothing will become patentable which is not already patentable now.*"

So if you understand the last part, it means that the objective of the Commission is going to validate patents which are currently granted by the EPO? Do you agree that the goal of DG Markt is only to validate the EPO practice?

----

After the Council meeting of 18th May 2004, some people discovered that the Greek Patent Office has in fact written the position of Greece regarding this directive. Same clues appears in France, where the INPI (Institut National de la Propriete Intellectuelle) have inspired the Press Release of the French delegation. Are you aware that Patent Offices are in facts really in position to dictate their views to people who decides in some countries? 

----

If this directive project fails, there will be pressure to modify the EPC. Does the EPO wants to remove the term "as such" so as so clarify that ideas of software are not patentable? Or does the EPO wants to remove the whole article? (Choose one of the 2 options)

----

Were you aware that Mr Howard, responsible for the Directive at DG Internal Markt, was working for the UKPTO before? Do you think it is normal that Patent Lawyers writes Patent law proposal? Do you think IP lawyers have an interest in seeing the field of patentability extended to software?

----

Could the EPO please explain how they know that software patents really create greater benefit than harm to society as a whole. What proof do you have for this, in the face of various studies showing the opposite? <Insert references here> Or if there is no proof that
software patents provide more benefit than harm to society, why then should we still implement them?

----

Technical is Technical. I think everybody agrees with that. Why does the EPO doesn't want to provide a definition of technical (dixit EPO representative at EIF meeting in november)?
