 Hi!

 We vote for parties, not for candidates.

 I cannot recommend anyone who have strong commitment,
 sorry.
 
 However I think that voting to small parties are better
 for democracy, as the EP vote on swpats also shown. It is
 because small parties are more responsive.
 
 We have two small parties with chance to have an elected candidate:
 SzDSz (Liberals) and MDF (EPP).

 To me personally SzDSz is less antipathic than other parties,
 and also Imre MÃ©cs, who is the MP who does the most for
 us is in SzDSz (however he don't have too much weight within
 his own party, exactly because he is a straight man).

NB: the above is a personal opinion, and if you are Hungarian and reading this you may want to put things into a different perspective (the edit-button lower right corner is for that)
