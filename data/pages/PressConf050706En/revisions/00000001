  Thank you President. This vote has been extremly important, yes. I'm
  starting off by saying that if there'd only been internal
  disagreement in the Parliament and this disagreement was about a
  fifty-fifty split, I'm not at all certain that the result would had
  been what it was. But the extra argument, which give rise to so much
  enthusiasm and scoop to the rejection is the will of the Parliament
  to do what President has just described: to send to Council and
  Commission a strong signal that you cannot go in treating the
  Parliament like you've been doing. On this subject: there's been a
  total arrogant scorn from Commission and Council in public of the
  arguments and positions put forward by the Parliament at the first
  reading; the drafting of the proposal of the second reading by the
  Commission was made without any consultation of the Parliament, its
  spokers and rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, none; and there was
  even an attempt to squash the debate in the Council and on three
  occasions, the Commission tried to get it adopted without debate.

  Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Press, Europe is in crisis,
  specially in my country, but you see that things are emerging in
  Luxembourg... And I am convinced that the insufficiency of democracy
  in Europe is a significant component of this crisis.

  A couple of questions to President Borrell. First of all, in
  relation to the Community patents, do you think now that that's an
  end to dead issue, and if not, how do you think that an agreement
  could be reached on that if you can't reach an agreement on the
  sector issue. And you've mentionned that you're going to have
  discussions about this issue with President Barroso, maybe you would
  like to paint the picture of the atmosphere that might be created
  after that, or during that, those discussions, and what sort of
  discussions you're going to have with Mister Barroso, are you going
  to give a little slap on the wrist, again?

=== Answer from President Borrell 25:06-26:53 (FR+ES/EN) ===

 * [:PressConf050706Es: Spanish original]
 * Transcription of English simultaneous translation

  Taper sur quoi ? Ah si c'est sur la main... Non, ce n'est pas un 
  problème, on ne va pas se bagarrer, hein ?

  But, I think Mr. Rocard has been very clear: there is a problem; the
  Commision put forward a solution, that has to be approved by the two
  legislative bodies, one of them has not accepting by an overwhelming
  majority, and the subject is going back to the Commission. Now, very
  formaly, the Commission can say "well, you didn't want my solution,
  so there'll be no solution". This, you can say that would be
  unacceptable attitude. If there is a problem, we have to find a
  solution which can be approved by those who can approve it. So I
  think the Commissionners, who in the Parliament were so hastened to
  say in public and in private that the Parliament has to be carefull,
  because if it'd say "no", there wouldn't be any more proposals,
  they've lost an excellent occasion to keep silent. And Mr. Rocard is
  saying the Commission would not be able to maintain the situation in
  real terms, and formally they can. And legally, you couldn't
  criticize them of doing so. But perhaps Mr. Rocard could explain
  this better, because his opinion is that formally they could, but
  in real terms they couldn't -- that's what I've thought I understood
  you to say...

== Question for Reuters from Huw Jones 38:21-39:12 (EN/EN) ==

 * English transcription

  Yes, a question for Mr. Borrell. Can you give any comments on the
  lobbying you've seen? Mr. Rocard has just mentionned the naval
  battle and the abominable behaviour of some of the lobbyists. Are
  you gonna ask the Commission or the Parliament seek for the steps,
  regarding how lobbyists are controlled?

  [:Borrel :: « Des mesures sur le combat naval, vous dites ? » [Rires]
  « Non, le combat naval, c'était amusant, non ? Non, ce n'est pas
  ça... »]

  No, I'm referring to the lobbying in general, with this bill, I
  mean, did it raise any concerns for the Parliament services? Is that
  the ask for any particular steps to be taken?

=== Answer from President Borrell 39:12-40:34 (ES+FR/EN) ===

 * [:PressConf050706Es: Spanish original]
 * Transcription of English simultaneous translation

  In life, you shouldn't have too much of anything. You have to have
  just the right measure of everything. That's inevitable that
  organized lobbies defend their interests and they try to get close
  to the Parliament and try to explain. And the difference between
  explaining and lobbying and exercing pressure, well, is difficult
  to define. But of course, we cannot prevent the people who are
  interested in a subject from expressing their point of view, but of
  course we don't want too much of it. I mean, if the lobbie are not
  being so strong that they're dictating their solution on the people
  voting on things. And of course, that would be a situation that
  would require an institutional response. But I don't think we've
  arrived there yet, certainly not. I mean, I've seen that the MEPS
  are independant and that independance has not been invalidated by
  the presence of the lobbies and they have every right to be here. I
  don't know if Michel has any different view of the problem but I
  think, for the moment, this isn't a situation which require an
  institutional response.

== Question for XXX 42:20-43:52 (IT/EN) ==

''Thanks to review française translation, that was based upon a preliminary transcription from the english spoken translation.'' 

 * [:PressConf050706Fr: Italian original]
 * English translation (FFII)

  I speak Italian. Mr. President, what happened today and also the
  accusations, made by Rapporteur Rocard, and also by you, on the
  Commission for not having listened, for have had an arrogant
  behaviour, etc, is this all part of a trend, which we are beginning
  to see now in the Commission that is listening too much to the
  lobbies and not enough to European Parliament or indeed the civil
  society? I'm thinking here of the pressure that the UNICE is putting
  to go back from the REACH [Registration, Evaluation & Authorisation
  of Chemicals] regulations, for not present the thematic strategies
  on environment and air pollution... We know that Barroso has
  received a letter from UNICE and he has promptly reacted by putting 
  off this July 20th decision upon thematic strategies on pollution...
  So do you think that there is an answer by the Commission also at
  the crisis due to the "No" to the referenda that is going toward a
  more listening to industrial's lobbies and less listening to the
  Parliament and the public opinion and the civil society, the exact 
  contrary of what, probably, the Commission should do instead?
  Thanks.

=== Answer from President Borrell 43:52-45:38 (ES/EN) ===

 * [:PressConf050706Es: Spanish original]
 * Transcription of English simultaneous translation

  Well, let's not go overboard here. We shouldn't exagerate. I mean,
  we are keeping things on proportions. We're not calling into
  question the Commission in how it functions, nor waging any
  interinstitutional battle. As Mr. Rocard said, this is just a
  unprecedented situation and we're facing many new situations in
  this legislature. So, we started up questionning the composition of
  the Commission and since then we've been constantly in a new 
  situation. I mean, this had never happened before. Simply I have
  limited myself to say that even if the Commission has scrupulously,
  formally, respected the interinstitutional agreement, because we've
  been informed at every moment of their positions, I really think,
  frankly, that we have to see what the Parliament thinks on a debate
  what we have to do. As Mr. Rocard said, there's a problem that we
  can't avoid here. I mean, part of legislative bodies here doesn't
  like this solution, so we just have to seat together and decide
  what we do, and not taking unilateral decisions. And I as said, the
  Commission formally, they're covered by the Treaty, but I don't
  think this an answer we want to give. We want a cooperative,
  coordinated solution to these problems. But of course, I don't want
  to go overboard and get into another type of situations we don't
  want to get into.

 * [:PressConf050706Es: Spanish original]
 * Transcription of English simultaneous translation

  President, this results of 648 vote, you've been presented this as
  an overhaul rejection of the Commission's proposal. But we know that
  in this results, there are two main positions: one which was in
  favour and one which was against the proposal as presented by the
  Commission. Can we say that this general result is the position of
  the European Parliament against the Commission's proposal? I think
  it's difficult to say that, when you know the result includes two
  divergent positions.

=== Answer from President Borrell 46:22-46:49  (ES/EN) ===

 * [:PressConf050706Es: Spanish original]
 * Transcription of English simultaneous translation

  Well, it's like with the "No"s to the Constitution. There are the
  "No"s to the Constitution which are "No"s because it seems it's too
  little and others, because it seems it's too much. But when you add
  the heterogeneous "No"s, you reach that result. I mean, I'm not
  inside the mind of each MEP and noone was in his mind, but that's
  the number of "No"s there were. I don't know whether Mr. Rocard
  wants to add anything...
