== Letter text (english translation) ==

Dear Members of Parliament,

We beg you to take urgent action before May 17/18 in order to avert major damage from Czech citizens and industry.

Our country's representative in the EU Competitivity Council must strongly support the European Parliament's proposal on the EU directive 2002/0047 COM on software patents and reject the counter-proposal of the Irish Council Presidency.

You find our reasoning in the annexed resolution draft, which we urge you to adopt in this or a similar way.
