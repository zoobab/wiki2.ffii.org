European Internet Foundation (EIF) should not be confused with real Internet organisations such as IETF.  EIF's main field of activity seems to be hosting dinners for members of the European Parliament (!MEPs) at which the representatives of large corporations in Brussels can get access to the !MEPs. The organisation is mainly financed by these corporations.  The current patent legislation has inevitably been one of the leading subjects in these talks, and EIF has previously been used as one of the main channels for pro-software-patent activism in Brussels.

According to Karin Riss Jørgensen the message from the Microsoft founder was just as clear last week as it was in the meeting with the Danish ministers in November. More precisely, Microsoft will discontinue investments in EU countries, if it is not possible to patent software.

=== 2004-11-11 James Heald (FFII UK) reports: ===

EIF organised an excellent event on 2004-11-10, which provided an enormously useful opportunity for all parties in the CII discussion - MEPs, EU commission, EU presidency, patent holders, and ourselves - to meet and discuss the directive, first in a well structured more formal session, and then more informally over drinks and then a buffet dinner.

In the process I believe that all sides gained a much deeper face-to-face understanding of what the other players were really trying to achieve, and I can only hope that a number of misunderstandings were reduced.

In the end, such an organisation can becomes an avenue for a one-sided corporate entertaining/informercials; or it can create an almost unique inclusive, welcoming and balanced forum for raising the whole information quality of the deabte, and the level of understanding of all the participants. Which path it takes is determined by the integrity and vision of the MEPs on its board. In this case I was well impressed.

The rather suspicious and paranoid concerns related on the remainder of this page, written before the meeting by I don't know who, should not be read without considering how the meeting actually went.

== Backgrounds about Structure of EIF ==

Upon closer reading, it becomes clear that
[[http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=European_Internet_Foundation|EIF]]
is a platform for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying|Big Business Lobbying]] on topics like
[[http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=Intellectual_property|IPR]]. Its main field of activity seems to be hosting lunches  and dinners for MEPs at which the industry members of EIF can purchase time to present their topics before MEP dine. The organisation is mainly financed by large companies. A few small organisations also use EIF to get access to contacts.

The disinfopedia wiki says: "This organisation is an offsping of the
[[http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=Transatlantic_Policy_Network|United States Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN)]]
''(an US organisation dedicated to influencing EU policy, whose Members include Microsoft, IBM, Siemens, Phillips)''
and Internet Education Foundation".
[[http://www.golem.de/0002/6403.html|German announcement also cites good relation with the "Global Business Dialogue" A]].

 * Key !MEPs are awarded the title of "governor" - For example: [[Swpatamccarthy| Arlene McCarthy]], [[EllyPloojVanGorselEn| Elly Plooj Van Gorsel]], [[ErikaMannDe| Erika Mann]]. Erika Mann distributed the invitation to the obvious EIF-FFII counter lobbying event to all !MEPs.  
   * German only: [[http://erikamann.com/scripts/index.php3?id=127&akpage=0|European Internet Foundation (EIF) Angaben von Erika Mann ueber ihr Mitwirken bei EIF]] - she also presents EIF as lobby host of big industry, as one of the governors of EIF - seemingly with an active role - she ought to know.
 * EICTA, Siemens etc have been using EIF for patent lobbying
 * The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Software_Alliance|BSA]] paid [[http://global.bsa.org/eupolicy/networksecurity/|money for a lobbying event]] about [[http://www.ffii.org/proj/enisa|ENISA]]. Quote: 
 On June 11, 2003, BSA co-sponsored a public forum on the proposed EU Regulation establishing a Network and Information  
 Security Agency. Government/industry partnership and international cooperation on network and information security were 
 key themes. The Public Forum was followed by dinner under the auspices of the European Internet Foundation.
 * Cecua031207En: EIF hosts [[http://www.eifonline.org/site_16/fil/fil_23.pdf|pro-patent paper]] of Alain Moscowitz, secretary of other Brussels lobbying organisations after he spoke in favour of software patents at an EIF meeting on 2002-01-12.


 * EIF role at hearing - Hartmut Pilch had the opportunity to report from one of the EIF forums/dinners: [[http://swpat.ffii.org/events/2002/europarl11/#lobb|FFII: A Glimpse]] into EU [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying|Lobbying]] Structures
 * recently [[http://www.edri.org/|EDRI]] has become a member and has threatened to withdraw Membership if EIF adopts [[SwpateictaEn| EICTA]] positions on software patents
 * EIF tour with Plooij, [[SwpatamccarthyEn| McCarthy]] et al [[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/amccarthy/index.en.html#microsoft|to Microsoft in Seattle in summer 2003]]
