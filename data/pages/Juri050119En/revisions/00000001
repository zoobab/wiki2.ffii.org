In a meeting in JURI about the restart, the moderater Klaus-Heiner Lehne from EPP did everything to postpone the decision to a date where the Parliament no longer has the option available.  Lehne also reiterated fallacies of the patent lobby, such as that the Council text is about preventing an extension of patentability by patent courts.  The notes confirm that the decision is on the agenda of the Fishery Council.

 The commissionner has asked to JURI to wait til he comes to the committee
 on 2 Febr.

 Klaus-Heiner Lehne (EPP, meeting president): 
 the presidency confirms that will be adopted next week ; let's do what
 McGreevy asks, our group will decide next week about the reconsultation. The
 Luxemburgese minister told us that we are going to lose time and that
 there is in the meanwhile an evolution of the jurisprudence in favour of
 granting software patents and we need this legislation fast. He is right.

 Monica Frassoni explains that we want art 55 to be on the agenda of JURI;
 she explains all the reasons for that (enlargement ; many oppositon in EP
 and in Council; scope of directive is broader than what Commission says,
 ...

 Speroni (NI, Ligua Lombardia) : supports Frassoni

 Berger : even if we vote the 55 the treatry do not force the Commission to
 re-write a proposal. I want this point to be on the OJ of JURI as I
 earlier required, I want a debate not a vote yet.

 Gargani : as a coordinator you will be able to ask that 62 be applied.

 Lehne : the Commission and Council have a CP. If there is no adoption in
 Council next week then I will be open to a reconsultation. But this has
 never happended in EP before.

 Libicki : supports Frassoni and Speroni

 Berger : do the coordinators yes or no have the right to place sth on the
 agenda ?

 Gargani : you changed your mind in the course of things, this is why it is
 not on the agenda.

 Berger : I simply wanted a debate in the JURI committee.

 Lichtenberger : Poland will give its formal agreement but not an agreement
 on the content; many gouvernments and parliaments are unhappy ; the
 Council is not in a situation to make progress on the content ; I insist
 that EP defends its rights and its amendments.

 Gargani : Mrs. Berger, do you want it on the agenda tomorrow yes or no ?!

 Berger : no answer

 Lehene : no

 Wallis : no

 Frassoni : yes

 Berger : let's just talk about it in JURI when we report back from the
 coordinators at the start of the meeting.
