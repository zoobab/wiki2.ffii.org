= Copyright vs. Software Patents Comparison =

Purpose: Collect statements from an informal discussion that took place in 11/2004

= PHM to Stellnack =

==== Broadness ====
 But what i am pointing at is why SWP is automaticly broad.

They are not. Some are very narrow.

 In many discussions, one of our arguments is that no one wants
 broad patents (exept the owner of such), but to be able to back
 up that you have to be able to explain why they get broad.

We don't have to explain any such automatism, and it doesn't exist.

 If we are to use the "auto-broadness" argument we must some
 how be able to explain for a computer illiterate why SWP gets
 automaticly broad.

An impossible task. They don't automatically get broad. Their breadth is limited by novelty/non-obviousness.

==== Copyright-based attack? ====

 I think that it is better to attac this from the copyright side,
 where authors get their exclusive right broken, from that side
 we have the law and international treaties on our side.

We can't assume the ffii/beauprez interpretation of these laws/treaties
to be accepted everywhere.

 I would really appreciate if someone have that magic reasoning,
 that can explain this to, say a person that never ever has surfed
 the internet.

First of all, it is wrong to demand from us that we prove why software
is different from patentable objects.

==== Physical vs. Immaterial? ====
I forgot to answer to Joaquim before: it is also wrong of us to say that
if somebody did something in the physical realm he should be entitled to
a patent. A patent is not a moral category to which someone can be
titled. It is a specific set of rules whose performance in view of a
function must be measured. And we as software experts know that it doesn't
perform in our field and we don't want it there. The burden of proof is
then on the other side. If it still isn't, we'd better get insist a
bit more, giving some examples of how the patent system is producing only
junk in our field and charging the others to come up with the good patents
and the reliable rules for producing them. As soon as we leave that level
and start charging ourselves with unnecessary burdens of proof, we have
probably lost.

==== Phm's Support for Erik ====
Eric's way of putting the things has been fairly well tested in many
dialogs in Sweden and BXL and he often finds nice metaphors for making
things understood. (---> But: Eric uses the broadness argument as a key argument, AR)
