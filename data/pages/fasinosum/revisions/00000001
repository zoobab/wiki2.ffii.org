"fasinosum" is a theory that anything that is looks really complex must be patentable
----
"The ''fasinosum'' is a feeling of joy, gratitude, pleasure, or onrush of grace, at catching a glimpse of the Ultimate, or numen; the ''tremendum'' is a reaction of awe, horror, fear, or a feeling of being overwhelmed. As in the esthetic experience, both the negative and the positive are seen as valid and therefore endurable" excerpt from [http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/creativity_and.html Creativity and Personal Freedom]
