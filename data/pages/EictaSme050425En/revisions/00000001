''*Correction:* the original text stated René Stockner currently still is global manager for Microsoft Navision. This is incorrect, he gave up that job when he became CEO of Giritech. We apologise for spreading outdated information in this regard.''

''25 April 2005 -- Apparently unable to find enough independent small and medium-sized enterprises SME//s to lobby for software patents, EICTA has resorted to sending companies to the European Parliament in which its multinational members hold a strong position. Additionally, several SME//s who were inspired by this action and signed EICTA's appeal turn out not to have any software patents at all.''

"The patent system in Europe has worked well for us in the past", says Jan Ishøj Nielsen, CEO of !PremiTech A/S. However, he forgets to mention that his company's first European software patent is still waiting to be granted (its US cousin is already valid) and that the Chairman of the Board of his company is Klaus Holse Andersen, VP Microsoft Business Solutions EMEA. Mr. Andersen was previously also CEO of the investment company IVS, another signatory of EICTA's demands.

Apart from sending !SMEs to Brussels, EICTA also organised a letter writing campaign to the European Parliament. While for most companies the CEO has signed this letter, in case of Giritech the CTO observes the honours. One reason for this might be that the CEO of Giritech, René Stockne, was global manager for Microsoft Navision until November 2004. This is the same Microsoft Navision that threatened the Danish government during that same month with moving out of Denmark if the software patents do not come through.

Jonas Maebe, FFII Board Member, comments:

 It is really sad how low EICTA is sinking here. Unable to factually
 counter the resistance to software patents from real SME associations
 such as UEAPME and CEAPME, they are now resorting to dressing up
 Microsoft as an SME. "Oh, grandmother, what big teeth you have got"
 indeed.
Some other companies that signed the letter and which are not tied to any big firms, have simply been improperly informed about the reach of the European Parliament's amendments. For example, Te Strake, an innovative Dutch SME active in the field of "mechatronics", owns several patents on inventions related to automated weaving. According to an analysis performed by the FFII, all of their patents would remain enforceable under the directive as approved by European Parliament in first reading.

Hartmut Pilch, President of the FFII, comments on the results of FFII's preliminary analysis:

 Preliminary research shows that most of these companies own less than
 a handful of patents and that the claimed solutions either involve
 forces of nature and are largely unaffected by the Parliament's first
 reading, or are in the realm of abstract problem descriptions or
 business methods and thus should, according to these companies' own
 "Manifesto", not be patentable.
Nevertheless, the fact that EICTA's tactics work to a certain extent
was demonstrated last week at the European Parliament's Legal Affairs
Committee (JURI) meeting. A number of !MEPs there was convinced that
most !SMEs do want software patents, and that "only programmers" oppose
them. The FFII therefore urgently calls upon the real !SMEs to stand up
and to make their voice heard in Brussels.
