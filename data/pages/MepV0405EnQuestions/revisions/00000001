LUG hellas(Greece) has a greek version of the questionnaire and the background document in greek.
 
== Notes ==

 * notes on Q1: freedom of publication implies rejection of program claims, also according to JURI.  In the JURI vote of 2003-06-17 freedom of publication (5A?) became "caduc" because program claims had already been accepted.
 * notes on Q2: the former numbering 6a is now overwritten by teh Parliament secretariat. Also the exact wording of 6a can be improved.
