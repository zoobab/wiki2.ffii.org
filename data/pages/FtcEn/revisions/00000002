=== from the Conclusion (Chapter 3, IV.G page 152): ===

Panelists in the hardware and semiconductor industries emphasized '''competition''' as a driver of innovation. Trade secret protection also contributes to innovation in these industries. Testimony regarding the role of patents was '''mixed'''. The record generally corresponded with the results obtained by Professors Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh in their business survey of appropriability mechanisms for firms in the United States: the semiconductor industry was '''among the least reliant''' on patents to appropriate returns on investment in R&D. [281] ...

The hearing record highlighted many of the issues that economists suggested might arise in contexts that involve cumulative innovation and a multiplicity of patents. Specifically, the participants from these industries '''confirmed''' a trend toward '''defensive''' patenting and stated that patents can '''deter''' innovation:
 * (1) by contributing to patent '''thickets''', and
 * (2) through their use by NPEs to hold up PPEs.
Panelists also observed that various patent licensing arrangements - cross-licensing, patent pools, and the licensing requirements of standard setting organizations - have helped to mitigate the potential '''harm to innovation''' caused by patent thickets.
