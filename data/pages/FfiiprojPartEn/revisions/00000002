----

 * Obtain a ffii user id (uid) in http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en to facilitate project coordination
 * Write to __proj-help at ffii org__, explain that you have a certain number of hours available for helping, ask for assignment of a task, name your ffii user id. Alternatively you can write to a national helpdesk such as __at-help__, __de-help__, __uk-help__, __se-help__ 
 * For wizards: use the [[http://www.ffii.org/assoc/knecht/proj/|Knecht]] system for signing up to projects (for non-wizards a web interface will soon be available in http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en, before that molest _proj-help at ffii org_)
 * You can also directly enter your uid, role and optionally name, telephone number and e-mail adress under a heading such as "project members" on a specific project wiki page 
 * Join a regional mailing list __xx-parl at ffii org__ where __xx__ is your ISO 2-letter country code and a web subscription form is found at !http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/xx-parl/ (don't worry when you see 'error 500', it works)
