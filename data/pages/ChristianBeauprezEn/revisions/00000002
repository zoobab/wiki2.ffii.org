Christian Beauprez is a programmer who has studied law.  Christian runs the website codeliberty.org, where he has, beside some humorous pieces and database search systems, studied the position of patents and copyright in the system of !TRIPs, Berne Convention and European Patent Convention, arriving at the conclusion that "programmers have rights" and that these rights are under threat from a lobby of patent lawyers acting in bad faith.
