'''FFII: EU Software patents in the Council: Status'''
 
 What's Happening:
 -----------------
 
 We need to act now to tell our representatives not to support
 the EU Council's attempts to overturn the European law under
 which software is not patentable: http://kwiki.ffii.org/ShortIntroEn 
 
 What you can do:
 ----------------
 
 Please tell your representative to withdraw support for the EU
 Council's Software Patents Directive, or we may have to live
 with the results of this decision for a very long time.

   - Please send the Urgent Call to your representatives:
     http://kwiki.ffii.org/LtrConsSend0406En
 
   - Please send postcards to your representatives:
     http://kwiki.ffii.org/Postkard0407En
 
 
 Personal contacts make all the difference. We need MPs and MEPs
 and Ministers who deal with technology and innovation to receive
 multiple postcards and Urgent Call letters from their
 constituents.  Translations of the Urgent Call, sample postcards
 and Contact addresses are available for many countries at the
 above links.  If you don't find the information for your
 country, please add it.
 
 Feedback and Pointers:
 ----------------------

 We conduct volunteer outreach via IRC every Monday 
 night on #bxl-ffii at irc.debian.org.  You are welcome 
 to come in at other times too.
