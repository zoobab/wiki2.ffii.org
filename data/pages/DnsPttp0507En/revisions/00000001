''6th July 2005 -- The FFII has registered the domain power-to-the-parliament.org and pre-registered power-to-the-parliament.eu.''

The site should help strengthen the European Parliament in its struggle against disrespectful ministerial bureaucrat and encourage it to say No to sleazy legislative proposals more quickly in the future.

The first immediate content of the site could be a thank you to those members of the European Parliament who worked in this sense in the case of the software patent directive.

Starting on 7th of July, the domain [http://www.power-to-the-parliament.org/ power-to-the-parliament.org] preliminarily points to the swpat.ffii.org website.
