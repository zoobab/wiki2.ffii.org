''According to press reports some European judges started partisan campaigning on institutional patent reform drawn from the European patent litigation agreement (EPLA) from 1999. Their aim is to create a single European Patent Court and enforce an English language policy. This remarkable move which reflects a unusual understanding of their institutional role was put forward in Venice during a meeting of the European Patent Lawyers association.''

Legal week writes:

 The judges resolution, which is being backed by
 the UKs most senior IP judges, Lord Hoffmann and 
 Lord Justice Jacob, is to form the basis of a campaign [!] 
 to lobby [!] European Union (EU) governments on the issue. 

According to the same article the judges criticize a Commission's proposal:

 The campaign [!], signed by 24 patents judges [!] from 10 EU countries, 
 calls [!] for the European Commission to ditch its own preferred 
 model for patent reform, which would create a centralised court 
 in Luxembourg to police a new European patent. 

Lord Justice Jakob acknowledges that this move is possibly exceeding the institutional role of judges:
 "This move is thoroughly unusual, I have never heard of anything 
 like it. It is now up to industry to run with it." 

As a representative body of the SME industry in the field of software patents FFII is likely not to "run with it". FFII
currently [[ComPatEn| investigates the implications of the Community Patent regarding the unresolved issue of software patents]] and has serious [[LtrVrijschriftComPat050915En| objections against leaving institutional reform to the patent community]].
The previous European Community action for a community patent stalled May 18 2004 due to language reasons in the European Council of Ministers. The
very same day a political agreement on the uncommon position regarding the software patents directive was reached which forced Parliament 
later to trash the directive in its second reading. Strong institutional resistance of the patent system to the legislator's will including moves such as [[EpEpoDay050330PressConfEn| EPO-lobbying of the European Parliament]] demonstrated an unbalance in the framework for European patent policy. Again the EPO here underlines its deliberate understanding of its institutional role:

 The EPO[?)] welcomed the judges support for 
 a single court, which it said was desperately 
 needed.


== EPO EPLA process and the judges proposal (coke or pepsi?)  ==

The judges proposal also targets to narrow down the official languages of the European Patent System to English as a default language in the proceedings and suggests to give German and French a minor role. Contrary FFII is committed to the promotion of the German language (and other native languages) [[http://www.ffii.org/assoc/statut/index.en.html|by its statutes]]. [[http://patlaw-reform.european-patent-office.org/epla/|An EPO page on the stalled EPLA process in the name of 'patent reform' can be found on the EPO web]]. The current EPLA [[http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/epla/pdf/statute_draft.pdf|statute draft 2004-02-16]] however says: 

 "The language regime is based on the time-honoured 
 language regime of the EPO (English, French and German), 
 as refined by the London Agreement on the application of
 Article 65 EPC"

and even more intresting:
 
 (1) Apart from being members of other courts or
 boards of appeal of the European Patent Office or
 national patent offices, judges of the European
 Patent Court shall not pursue any gainful occupation
 unless authorised by the Executive Committee. Nor
 shall they occupy any political or administrative office.

The [[http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/epla/pdf/declaration.pdf|Working groups declared in late 2003]] that [[http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/epla/pdf/statute_draft.pdf|their proposal]]

 offer[s] an optimum solution for users of the European 
 patent system. It considers the drafts a suitable basis 
 for an intergovernmental conference to establish a 
 judiciary for the European Patent Organisation, remaining 
 divergences having been reduced as far as possible.

Regardless whether the judges proposal or the EPO EPLA proposal would get implemented instead of a Commission's draft or not: Both are drafts designed by stakeholders from the patent system for themselves which inherently neglect the principle of a political mandate over patent policy and institutional design. Experience shows that self-governance of the European patent system leads to institutional abuse and unbalance and does not serve the interests of the business community. FFII [[PatexamReformEn| currently develops own reform proposals for the EPO]] and more cost efficient [[IndpropEn| alternatives to the use of the patent system]].
