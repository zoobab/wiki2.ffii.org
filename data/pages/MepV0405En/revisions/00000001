== How to Do It ==

Send the questionnaire to a candidate and sollicit answers according to the instructions provided on the
MEP Questionnaire home page.  Enter the answers into the form in the [http://www.ffii.org/ffii-cgi/eintrag.b FFII Participation System] or send them to your national mailing list or national helpdesk (see [http://swpat.ffii.org/group/todo/ How to help] for details)

'''Update:''' Roughly all candidates got the questionnaire by E-Mail (from feedback_at_ffii.org) on 2004-06-09.  You may however need to push them for an answer.  See ElectQuestResp0406En for first results, but also use the [http://www.ffii.org/ffii-cgi/eintrag.b FFII Participation System] to feed the database.
