The Greens in the European Parliament have sent a letter to the chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI), Giuseppe Gargani, asking for a restart of the procedure on the software patents directive.  This will have the effect that the restart issue is on the agenda of the coordinators meeting of JURI next week.  The outcome will depend on whether the majority of political groups will be backing the motion.

The Greens have issued a press release on this subject which was published on the Greens-EFA site in [[http://www.greens-efa.org/en/press/detail.php?id=2240&lg=de|german]] and of which you may soon find an english version [[http://www.greens-efa.org/en/press/detail.php?id=2240&lg=en|here]].  The English version is also printed below.

  Re : Directive on patentability of computer-implemented inventions (com(2002)092)

  Dear President,

  as you know, elections have taken place since the first reading of
  the Directive on patentability of computer-implemented inventions (com
  (2002) 092). As a consequence, with reference to article 55 of the
  Rules of Procedures, we believe that the conditions for a renewed
  referral of the Commission proposal are now met. Our belief is based
  also on the fact that the present uncertainty concerning
  patent-related risks has shown to have implications on the decisions
  taken by public administrations and the private sector, with regards
  to IT infrastructures, and produces negative effects on their ability
  to purchase software and services from Small and Medium Enterprises.

  We, therefore, kindly ask you to place this proposal on the agenda
  of the next meeting of the Legal affairs committee in order to have an
  exchange of views on the feasibility of restarting the co-decision
  procedure on this Directive.

PRESS RELEASE - Strasbourg 13 January 2005 

Letter to Legal Affairs Committee:

Greens call for new start to software patents directive

The Greens in the European Parliament today sent a letter to the
Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee calling for a restart to the
legal procedure concerning the controversial software patents
directive. In the submission to the President of the Committee,
Giuseppe Gargani, Greens/EFA Co-President Monica Frassoni and Austrian
MEP Eva Lichtenberger asked for the point to be included on the agenda
of the Committee's next session (on Wednesday, 19 January).

Commenting on the initiative, Eva Lichtenberger, Member of the Legal
Affairs, said:

  "We need a new start for the software patents directive. The
   situation in Council, who are now responsible for the legal procedure,
   is so confused that Parliament must again take the issue into its
   hands. The Ministers committed a big mistake on 18 May when they
   ignored Parliament's improvements and adopted a legislative proposal
   which principally serves the interests of big companies. Since then
   the situation has changed dramatically and some European governments
   were put under pressure by their own national parliaments to stop the
   introduction of software patents through the backdoor."

  "To admit software patenting would be a big setback for the Europe's
   growing IT sector. Small and medium enterprises would be hit
   especially hard as they cannot afford neither patenting fees nor the
   legal costs that would be involved. Member States should again
   consider if they are shooting themselves in the foot by pursuing
   US-inspired software patents. By doing so they would be gravely
   diminishing the innovative capacity and flexibility of European IT
   companies."

Monica Frassoni added:

  "The Greens will now create the necessary pressure so that a new
   procedure is started as soon as possible. With this new beginning we
   hope to finally be able to reach to a reasonable solution."
