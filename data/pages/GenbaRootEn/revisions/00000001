News:
 * bkaindl: place for internal documentaiton of services: http:admin/GenbaInternalEn
 * bkaindl: created http:admin/GenbaChangeLogEn to log private, but not root-only changes in it.

== Administrators ==

 * bkaindl, jeroen and cebewee
 * previous admins tanner and breiter still know the password and are willing to support the new admins
 * phm also knows the password (extensive genba users can hardly do without the root password at the moment), mwas too, but only if nobody is reachable 

== Legacy Rules ==

some older changes are documented in
 /root/ChangeLog
