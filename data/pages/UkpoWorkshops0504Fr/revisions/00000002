''17 March 2005 -- Last week a new report from the German Government backed anti-software patent campaigners, the largest EU petition against the introduction of software patents swelled to 400,000 signatures, and charity groups in the US banded together to fight the dangers of the patent system, as the UK Patent Office conducted the latest of its examinations into how far software patentability in Europe will extend. But is it too little too late?''

FFII-UK spokesman Rufus Pollock said, "These workshops have shown 
several things
that cause us great concern, while reinforcing that the current 
Directive will
place an intolerable burden on software development. Economists have 
shown
this, developers know this, and small and medium enterprises greatly 
fear it.
At the end of the day the only people to benefit will be patent 
lawyers"

Discussing the workshops, he added "What the Patent Office says it 
wants is
this: 'pure' software that is not patentable and 'computer implemented
inventions' that are 'technical' and patentable. The definition of 
'technical
contribution' used in practice does not keep the processing, handling,
representation and presentation of information by a computer program 
outside of
the scope of patentability. Simply put, under the current text of the 
directive
software is patentable."

"The feedback we have received from workshop attendees has clearly 
demonstrated
the problems with the Council text in terms both of clarity and what it
includes/excludes from patentability. An alternative wording proposed 
by
FFII-UK appeared to be both clearer and simpler while still drawing the 
right
line for patentability."

"But for those facing court costs running to the hundreds thousands, 
denial of
entry to the market place, and the loss of freedom to innovate while 
creating
and publishing original work, these consultations will seem like too 
little too
late, particularly when the Council approved this very text only a few 
weeks
ago. Nevertheless they do add further weight in our call to the 
European
Parliament to either suitably amend the Directive, or failing that, 
reject it."

"FFII has welcomed the workshops as a rare opportunity for stakeholders 
to
highlight the problems of the current directive, but warns that a US 
style
system of broad and trivial patents will be written into European law 
unless
action is taken now."

Ends.
