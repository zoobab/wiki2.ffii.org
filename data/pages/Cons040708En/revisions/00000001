leave a note here or write to phm if you are doing this! 

Even if you don't find anything about the swpat topic directly, posting
a summary of council meetings to this page would be appreciated, e.g.
something like

||  2004-07-xx  ||  IP Workgroup meeting  ||
||  2004-09-xx  ||  first ministerial meeting  ||
||  2004-10-xx  ||  Coreper meeting  ||
||  2004-11-xx  ||  summit  ||

Also, what are the priorities of the presidency ?

=== Note by Lark X-RAM ===

Did so, alas I have NOT found anything in there, concerning the "SW-Pats" Directive.
NO GUARANTEES, however!

BTW, the word "Directive" is NOT to be found as such, you have to C&P it from the text itself,
then it can be seen, that it is written as "Direc ive" - another flaw of the "Text Processing" 
software?

Have fun in the parliament, to our friends of NL! Nothing else seems to be left, 
but MB your Brinkhorst himself is flawed, concerning his NON-respect against his own parliament.

 I don't find the swpat directive.

 Is it hidden here:

 Transparency
 
 * open debates on acts adopted in accordance with the co-decision
    procedure
 
   - (Art. 251 TEC) and Art. 8.1.a of the Council's Rules of Procedures
 ???
