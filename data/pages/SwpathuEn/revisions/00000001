== Background ==

 * 2004-09-23 Mr. Barandy, the Justice Minister stepped down; he appointed Mr. Ficsor when he took office.
 * Patent Office president Ficsor leads the government's advisory group on "intellectual property"
   * Patent Office is responsible for formulating hungarian opinion on all "Intellectual Property" questions
   * Ficsor group follows and defends [:SwpatepoEn: EPO] line
   * IT ministry doesn't like the EPO/Council line
   * Foreign ministry also influential, interested mostly in avoiding conflicts with other governments
   * All or most of the representation of Hungary in the Council is done by Dr. Gottfried PÃ©ter
   * At some international meetings, Hungarian diplomats show themselves critical of US+EU patent extremism that is being pushed on them and not good for their economy.  The patent movement has a weaker basis than in UK and DE, but no shortage of ardent believers who preach that HU will eventually win the "strong IP" game if it takes the winner's approach now.  Others want to avoid being seen as a developping country with "lower IP standards".  Membership in EPO gives HU patent movement a sense of superiority in dealing with their government.
 * All Hungarian IT associations have issued statements against software patents
 * Free software very strong in HU, city of Szeged built its administration on it.
