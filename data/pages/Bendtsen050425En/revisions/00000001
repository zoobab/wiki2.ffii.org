''Copenhagen, 25 April 2005 -- Several articles in the major Danish newspaper Berlingske talk about the troubles that Danish minister Bendt Bendtsen still has due to his refusal to carry out the mandata he got from the Danish Parliament: reopen discussions about the software patents directive during the infamous 7 March 2005 Council session.''

"Minister Bendtsen is furious about the fight regarding his Parliamentary mandate", titles [http://www.berlingske.dk/indland/artikel:aid=568086/ one article]. He is angry because he is still being accused of ignoring a majority of the Danish Parliament. The Social Democrats, who are needed to achieve a majority in Parliament, internally disagree about what exactly the mandate was however. According to Niels Sindal of that party, Bendtsen did not exceed his mandate.

[http://www.berlingske.dk/indland/artikel:aid=568086/ Another article] in the same newspaper starts with

 Minister of Commerce Bendt Bendtsen could have fulfilled the wish of
 the Danish Parliament and blocked the adoption of a controverisal EU
 directive last month. However, he did not, because he chose to use the
 wrong procedure. Five parties want Bendt Bendtsen to explain himself
 in a debate.

Steffen Smidt, previously a general director in the EU-Commission, is quoted as saying "He should have said that he was not ready to vote on the subject. This would have meant that it would be renegotiated at a later meeting." Bendt Bendtsen claims however that this was impossible according to his own administration.

Social Democrat Henrik Dam Christensen does not believe this and refuses to accept that the civil servants in the Ministry of Commerce did not know the procedures regarding Council meetings. Svend Auken from the same party also wants an explanation from Bendtsen and said "During the 14 years I have been minister I have never seen that a minister simply ignored a mandate".

It is worth noting that both Svend Auken and Henrik Dam Christensen are
heavyweights in the Social Democrats, whereas Niels Sindal is a middleweight.
