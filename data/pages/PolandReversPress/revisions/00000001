OK, sorry about the naming convention, I didn't yet get used to thinking
up names compilant with it out of my head. 

On the second point, I find it useful to have all the articles about the
2004-11-16 cabinet decision on a separate page, with only links. If you
think its bad to have such a page here, no problem, I'll put a static
HTML on my own webserver with just these links.

Do whatever you want in kwiki, create your personal pages as you like but:

2004-11-04 UK ZDnet: Patents are evil

is better than just a link, however it takes time and discipline.

Productivity wishlist: Perhaps it could be possible to write a small web application with a few forms that creates news references that are automatically pasted into SwpatcninoEn and automatically the page is checked wether it was already posted.
