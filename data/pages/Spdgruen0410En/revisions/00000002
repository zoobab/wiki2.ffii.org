An resolution proposal of the Red/Green governing coalition on software is due for publication on wednesday 2004-10-27.   It is there now:
 * http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/spdgruen0410/spdgruen041019.pdf

German media have partially already reported about this motion and quoted excerpts from its preamble.  See [[Spdgruen0410De| German version]].

The paper is similar in content to the paper of the opposing Christian Democrats.  After a preamble part criticises the [[Cons040518En| Council's political agreement of May]] and applauds the [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/|vote of the European Parliament of September 2003]] (accompanied by some ambiguous dogmatic statements which show a continuing influence of patent lawyer thinking in the parliament), it contains a series of demands to the government which, if followed, would indeed force the leading ministry of justice to alter its course.  

One can only speculate about how the ministry would react.

So far the MoJ has been the most radical pro-software-patent lobby bastion in Germany (more radical than e.g. the patent departments of large companies, possibly because this ministry bears a great part of the responsibility for the questionable reinterpretations of Art 52 EPC that have resulted in the granting of more than 30,000 broad and trivial software patents by the EPO).

It would be surprising if the cold war between ministry and parliament, which has been observed in the [[SwpatnlEn| Netherlands]] for years, could be ended quickly by this show of parliamentary unanimity in Germany.
