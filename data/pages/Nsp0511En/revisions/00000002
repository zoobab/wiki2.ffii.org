''The Nosoftwarepatents.com campaign platform became a great success in a short time.  The intensive work put into it by its founder Florian Mueller paid off in terms of high visibility in media and search engines.  When Florian handed the platform over to FFII in April 2005, it visibly declined, because nobody was able to put in the same concentrated work.  We now have chances that Peter Gerwinski will revive it, but this requires permanent financial commitments.''

== Action Items from Peter Gerwinski ==

=== Most urgent: update the texts to cope with recent developments ===

With the removal of the "Appeal to the EU Council", the most pressing update has been done, but much more work is needed. Developments like the Community Patent have to be taken into account, and some of the texts need updates on a regular basis --- some of which may be subtle but make a big difference.

=== NoSoftwarePatents.com Award ===

After studying the plans by Harald Talarczyk, and comparing them to similar campaigns I conducted in the past (Patent Party, Patent Infringing Programming Contest), I concluded that they can be led to a success, provided that we do the hard work and make good use of our resources.

=== "Call for Action IV" fax signature campaign ===

In June/July, I successfully managed a fax signature campaign for the "Call for Action III". Nonwithstanding the tight time frame, this resulted in an impressive stack of paper displaying 651 signatures. Now, with more time and with a well-established platform like NoSoftwarePatents.com, we can easily collect several 1000 paper(!) signatures that can be handed over, for instance, to the Council of Ministers in the presence of journalists.

Note from phm: The planned [[Cpedu0510En| Call for Action IV]] should summarize the basic programmatic agenda for which FFII receives a mandate from its supporters.
