  WRITTEN QUESTION E-2232/06
  by David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    Task Force on ICT competitiveness
  
  In its document SEC (2005)1215 of 5 October 2005, the Commission
  undertook
  to set up a taskforce with stakeholdersÂ’ representatives on ICT
  competitiveness to ensure that public policy provides a supportive
  environment for the competitiveness of an evolving ICT sector. At the
  moment of the announcement, the Commission undertook to identify key
  obstacles to competitiveness and possible policy responses for issues
  such
  as better regulation, skills, IPR, and standardisation.
  
  Another main objective of the planned taskforce was, according to the
  European Commission, to be able to have a structured dialogue to help
  mobilise the sector and to draw the attention of Member States to the
  barriers to the competitiveness of ICT manufacturing in Europe and to
  the
  obstacles to wide and effective take-up. The Commission also affirmed
  that
  after the debate generated by the proposed directive on computer-
  implemented inventions (2002/0047/COD), it drew a lesson from the
  difficulties arising when trying to frame balanced IPR rules for all
  stakeholders.
  
  Surprisingly, last week, the European Commission announced the set-up of
  the ICT Task Force, but from the 15 seats allocated to industry
  representatives, nine were selected from EICTA, which means that the ICT
  group excludes many relevant European stakeholders, especially from the
  SME
  sector and civil society, and is biased towards non-European members
  such
  as large enterprises, including an American actor which is in a severe
  struggle with European competition authorities.
  
  Can the Commission explain how the ICT group qualifies to perform that
  task? Why should the Commission support non-European companies to lobby
  Member States for certain policies? On what legal basis does it do so?
