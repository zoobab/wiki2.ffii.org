''Keith Beresford, European Patent Attorney, author of the book "Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention", a manual which teaches the art of circumventing Art 52 EPC by the various means introduced by the European Patent Office, speaker at many political conferences and participant in advisory groups of the UK Patent Office, which has been one of the chief activists in bringing about the drifts of EPO caselaw and in pushing for their codification by new legislation.''
