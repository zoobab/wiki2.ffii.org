Again, Patent agents (also called patent attorneys nowadays) and likely a number of SMEs (or fakes such as companies which have been created from large companies by moving their departments into a smaller body, who's CEOs are former Managers if the "Mother") will speak in favour of the Council text, in the name of SMEs, however it's hard to know for an average MEP:

== Impact on SMEs ==
The question wether patents are of benefit to SMEs or rather to their detriment has been raised by a significant number of MEPs.
 Various short interventions will provide a appraisal of the potential impact of the Directive on SMEs, explain how different business models impact the '''collaboration between large and small businesses''' /emphasis is not in the original flyer) and finally present sme concrete examples from SME CEOs.

Together this will lead to a better understanding of what the Common Position wil mean for SMEs and what some of the proposed amendments could mean for SMEs
