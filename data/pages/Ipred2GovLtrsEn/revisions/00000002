(Brussels, 16 feb 2005) According to the title of a [[http://register.consilium.eu.int/servlet/driver?page=Result&#9001;=EN&typ=Advanced&cmsid=639&ff_COTE_DOCUMENT=&ff_COTE_DOSSIER_INST=2005%2F0127&ff_TITRE=&ff_FT_TEXT=&ff_SOUS_COTE_MATIERE=&dd_DATE_DOCUMENT=&dd_DATE_REUNION=&dd_FT_DATE=&fc=REGAISEN&srm=25&md=100&ssf=|non-public document appearing on the Council website]], the European Commission is asking the written oppinion of the 25 Member States which rights they want to see removed from the list of                                                                                                  the IPRED2 directive proposal (2005-0127 COD).                                                                                                                                                                   

The FFII and other associations are calling on the Member States to                                                                                                      remove patent infringements from the list of IP rights concerned. The                                                                                 broad and abstract nature of software patents makes infringement                                                                                                         unavoidable, and most software systems unavoidably infringe on multiple                                                                                       patents. The resulting litigation is already a problem in many sectors.
However, criminalisation of patent infringment would be catastrophic
change that would severely damage the innovation process, and thus the                                                                                                   European economies.

    The Commission is asking your written opinion before Monday 20th February

    business method patents granted by the European Patent Office. Those patents                                                                                         
    has been granted against the spirit of the European Patent Convention, which                                                                                         
    clearly excludes software from the field of patentability.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                         
    Last year, the directive on patentability of "Computer Implemented Inventions",                                                                                      
    which aimed to legalise the practice of the European Patent Office, was

    Patent infringement has always been a matter for civil litigation. The current                                                                                       
    proposal will force Member States to make patent infringement a crime, and to                                                                                        
    criminalise incitement to infringement.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                         
    The initial consequences of criminalisation of patent infringement will be a                                                                                         
    reluctance of firms to invest in new software products, in Europe. A firm                                                                                            
    requiring new software systems will prefer to import the software from                                                                                               
    outside Europe.  This will damage the EU software industry and cause loss of                                                                                         
    jobs, even though this industry is well able to compete on the global market.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                         
    Secondly, the directive will give patent litigants great powers to harrass                                                                                           
    software producers, seize documents and freeze assets.  We would see criminal                                                                                        
    law being used to enforce monopolies that are already highly controversial.                                                                                          
    The cost of these monopolies is higher prices, less innovation, and serious                                                                                          
    damage to EU economies as they lose the ability to compete on the world                                                                                              
    market.                                                        
   
    Thirdly, new business formation and economic growth will be damaged.  All                                                                                            
    technology entrepreneurs already take risks with respect to software patents                                                                                         
    and the vibrant EU software industry exists despite, not thanks to, software                                                                                         
    patents. Software patents tend to be have broad claims on trivial methods                                                                                           
    so that infringement is unavoidable. In the classic patent economy, a firm                                                                                           
    can bulk license patents by paying royalties. When patent infringement is a                                                                                          
    criminal offense, no civil settlement is possible.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                         
    Lastly, the use of criminal law, instead of civil law, makes patent                                                                                                  
    speculation and extortion much cheaper.  Today, a patent speculator needs

    unfair patent claims in court, it is a different matter when the police and

    In conclusion, the criminalisation of patent infringement will punish

    We thus ask you to exclude patent infringements from the list of IP rights

    litigation in the field of civil law, not criminal law.
    
    In general, the directive should be limited to rights of which it is proven
    that civil protection is not enough.
