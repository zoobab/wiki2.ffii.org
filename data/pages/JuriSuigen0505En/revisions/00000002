18 replaces "computer-implemented" with "computer-controlled", and additionally removes the ambiguous Council sentence, which could be interpreted that "technical business methods" should be patentable.

242 the same, except that it uses "computer-assisted" instead of "computer-controlled".

Similarly to Council recital 13, this newly inserted Council recital claims that there are non-technical inventions. This can obviously not be the case.
