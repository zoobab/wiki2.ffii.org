Alain Pompidou is a son of the late french president Georges Pompidou.

He does not come from the patent profession but rather works as a medical doctor and has a record of showing concern about genetic patents.  He has been a member of the European Parliament.

This is rare among EPO presidents and may make him somewhat more receptive for concerns about the effects of the patent system than others.  OTOH he is perhaps also under greater pressure to obey a recalcitrant apparatus than others would be.

Pompidou will be in office only until 2007.  His designated successor is the UK Patent Office chief [:AlisonBrimelowEn: Alison Brimelow].  This short office term is the result of wrangling between national ministerial officials in the European Patent Organisation.
