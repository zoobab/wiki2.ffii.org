== Proposal originally by bk, join #bxl-ffii and ask for bk if you want to change it. ==

Intention:

 * Short focused mail for supporters for the crucial monday
 * On Tuesday, mail for starting the MEP questionnaire(when the aktiv form is finished)

Mail 1:

 Hello $NAME(from the database)
 (you registered as supporter and can change your info at http://aktiv.ffii.org)

 The EU Council of Ministers will discuss the software patent directive in
 a public meeting in Brussels on tuesday. And if it agrees on the irish text,
 it'll send it back to the parilament for 2nd reading. The text didn't improve,
 but at least the political situation has significantly improved in the last week[1]:

 There is now hope that the text might be sent back to COREPER 

(thus moving the issue to the presideny
 of Netherlands in Autnum), if you can persuade your responsible minister/ministry
 officer and explain that what the patent offices say(that this limits patentabity)
 is not true and that in fact the opposite is true. Talk especially in favour of a
 better interoperability provision and a non-circular definition of technical.

 Please fill in, if not filled in correctly:

 I live in [$LAND] (at,be,cy,de,ee,es,fi,fr,ie,gr,hu,it,lt,lu,lv,ml,pl,pt,se,sk,si,uk)
