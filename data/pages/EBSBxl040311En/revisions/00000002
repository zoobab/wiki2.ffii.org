The European Business Summit of 11-12 March is an ideal platform to bring all
research & innovation stakeholders together. If we want to boost research efforts in Europe, we need to have an open debate with all parties involved. 

Policy makers should listen to the needs of the business world, business leaders should explore ways to intensify the co-operation between industry and public research and scientists should feel better rewarded in Europe.
