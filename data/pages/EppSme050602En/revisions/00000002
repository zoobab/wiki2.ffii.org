''Announcement of a hearing organised by the pro-patent group within EPP.  Initially it was conceived as a hearing of small and medium enterprises, but in the end mainly patent lobbyists were invited as speakers, and the "coordinator" Lehne concluded with one-sided statements in favor of this group.''
