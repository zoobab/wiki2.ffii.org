= Bolkestein protests against harshness toward Microsoft =

As reported by [[http://www.pressetext.at/|Pressetext Austria]] - a commercial Austrian news service
- in http://www.pressetext.at/pte.mc?pte=040224011 (in German language) the member of the European
Comission Frits Bolkestein intervenes one more time in support of Microsoft to lower the pending
fine for abusing the monopoly (as admitted by Microsoft itself) on the operating system on
desktop computers.

The key aims of the intervention - according to the message - are to avoid a "too drastic fine"
meaning the amount of money and devaluation of "intellectual property" 
of Microsoft.
Further, according to Bolkestein, the verdict sould not force Microsoft to change its policies and methods which are applied
against its competitors.
