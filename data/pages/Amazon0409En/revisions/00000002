== Story ==

In June Amazon notified SEC that a company called IPXL Holdings has been suing Amazon for patent infringement: 

 On January 22, 2004, IPXL Holdings, LLC brought an action against us for patent infringement in the
 United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges that aspects
 of our online ordering technology, including 1-ClickÂ® ordering, infringe a patent obtained by IPXL
 purporting to cover an "Electronic Fund Transfer or Transaction System" (U.S. Patent No. 6,149,055) and
 seeks injunctive relief, monetary damages in an amount no less than a reasonable royalty, prejudgment
 interest, and attorneys' fees. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing in this complaint and intend to
 vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. 

According to media reports, the IPXL complaint was rejected by a Virginia court in June.
