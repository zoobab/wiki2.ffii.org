 * H.P. Martin group big winner (anti-swpat, for transparency, similar to Buitenen in NL) 
 * national liberals (FPÖ, mostly anti-swpat) lose dramatically 
 * ÖVP loses slightly (good result given that they are governing in Austria)
 * Socialists win slightly (voted ambiguously on swpat but gave good pledges - promised to act against big corporations)
 * Greens (anti-swpat) keep their mandates 
 * LINKE (left, anti-swpat) lose
