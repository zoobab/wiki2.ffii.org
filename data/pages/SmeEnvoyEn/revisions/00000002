= SME Envoy =
There seems to be an [[http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/entrepreneurship/sme_envoy/|SME Envoy]]. From the page:

The SME Envoy '''acts as a key interface with the SME community, considering their specific interests and needs in''' EU Programmes and '''legislation'''. Thanks to the SME Envoy, '''SME interests and needs can be better identified at an early stage and highlighted''' to the relevant Commission services, so '''ensuring that their concerns are taken into consideration and that adequate and efficient measures are implemented'''.

He addresses concrete enterprise policy issues of current interest, such as improving the financial environment of SMEs, '''better regulation''', '''implementation of the Internal Market''', developing high quality support services for SMEs or ensuring easier access to European programmes. The SME Envoy pays particular attention to the craft sector, small businesses and sole traders because of their specific needs.
