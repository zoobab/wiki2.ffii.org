----

The script

	genba:/var/www/adm/bin/kwikiprot

sets all kwiki pages read-only (i.e. editable after login only).

This script is invoked once per month via

	genba:/var/www/adm/bin/monthly.knecht

from the knecht crontab.

All ffii active members have editor rights. 

An editor is free to make a kwiki page world-writable again.

This is recommended when 
 * there is an active community working on the page
 * contributions can be expected from non-active-ffii-members
 * the page is not very interesting for index spammers (not exposed to a large public, no high rank in google etc)
