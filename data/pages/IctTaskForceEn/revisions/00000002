  Launch of the ICT Task Force

  First Meeting of the ICT Task Force
  Brussels, 7th June 2006
  Ladies and Gentlemen,
  Welcome to a Task-Force that:
  represents every facet of the ICT manufacturing and services sectors;
  brings together industry with other stakeholders in the sector: trades
  unions, SMEs, chambers of commerce, consumers,   investors and academia.
  The context of the Task-Force: our new industrial policy
  The Task-force is one of the sector-specific initiatives foreseen in the
  Commissions Communication on industrial policy in October 2005.
  Industrial policy should not ...
  ... disturb well-functioning markets.
  ... pick winners.
  ... be protectionist.
  ... take over industry's role.
  The Commissions new industrial policy is about improving framework
  conditions across industrial sectors in different policy areas: e.g. research
  and innovation, trade, environment, public procurement, education and training
  ...
  Targeted sectoral actions complement our framework policy approach, working
  with the markets and stakeholders via high-level groups and task-forces, such
  as this ICT Task-Force.
  The ICT Task-Force
  Your aim is to help us ensure that public policy provides a supportive
  environment for fostering the competitiveness of the ICT sector and the uptake
  of ICT in Europe.
  We expect the mebers of the task force, via the working groups, to:
  inventory obstacles to the competitiveness of the sector and to the uptake of ICT;
  identify the most important obstacles;
  recommend possible policy responses.
  We are particularly interested in recommendations that aim to strengthen
  links and synergies between policies addressing:
  Better Regulation
  R&D
  innovation
  education and training
  for firms large and small  the business environment.
  The Commission is very interested to hear your views on where the Commission
  should be concentrating its efforts towards enhancing the competitiveness of
  the ICT sector.
