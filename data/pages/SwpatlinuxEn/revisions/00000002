[[OsrmEn| OSRM]] says that the Linux kernel infringes on 283 US software patents, most of which could probably be defeated in court.

Linux kernel developper Linus Torvalds has consistently warned of the danger of software patents and yet advised developers to tackle the threats as they come rather than try to steer around each patent, which would be tantamount to giving up Linux development.

Microsoft has been targetting Linux with a large patent portfolio and an aggressive licensing policy which excludes free software from use of the ideas which they have patented, and with warnings that coroporate Linux users are exposed to patent dangers.
