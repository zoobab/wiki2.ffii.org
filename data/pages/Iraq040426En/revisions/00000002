According to GregNews, the USPTO intranet had the following news on 2004-04-26:

  Assignment Iraq

  Linda Lourie, an Attorney-Advisor in the USPTO's Office of External
  Affairs has begun an assignment in Iraq to assist the Coalition
  Provisional Authority (CPA) in rebuilding that nation's intellectual
  property offices.

  Attorney-Advisor Lourie will be working within the commercial law
  section and will focus her efforts on bringing Iraq's IP law in
  compliance with international treaties and modern standards. ....

  Developing strong intellectual property protection in Iraq is a high
  priority for the Coalition Provisional Authority, particularly since
  it will encourage foreign and local investment in IP dependent
  industries. Ms. Lourie expects to be in Iraq for three to four
  months.
