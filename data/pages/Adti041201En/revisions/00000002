Alexis de Tocqueville institution is a think tank, a hired gun that provides studies on demand for industry groups. Usually the funding organisation behing the campaign is not made public. As the News is reported from SCO's LinuxInsider it is not that hard to guess who spreads the rumors. ADTI is part of the dirty lobbying portfolio. As studies from this think tank have no credibility we recommend you not to waste your precious time on arguing against it.

Alexis de Tocqueville is the name of a famous french philosopher from enlightment who is very often quoted in the US.
