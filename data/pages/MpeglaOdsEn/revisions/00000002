  (Denver, Colorado, US  02 August 2005)  MPEG LA today announced that several leading electronics
  companies and a university have filed suit in Germany against Optical Disc Service (ODS) for
  infringing patents used in DVD disc manufacturing. Plaintiffs include France Télécom, S.A.; Fujitsu
  Ltd., GE Technology Development, Inc.; Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV; Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co., Ltd.; Mitsubishi Electric Corporation; Robert Bosch GmbH; Sony Corporation; Thomson
  Licensing S.A., The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, and Victor Company of
  Japan, Ltd.
  We regret that ODSs refusal to take a license with individual patent holders or with MPEG LA has
  made it necessary for these companies to decide to take legal action , said MPEG LA CEO Baryn S.
  Futa. ODSs continued use of MPEG-2 essential patents without a license is unfair to both patent
  holders and DVD manufacturers who are meeting their MPEG-2 intellectual property obligations. It also
  leaves their customers exposed to patent infringement liability. DVD manufacturers need a license under
  MPEG-2 essential patents, and MPEG LA hopes ODS will rectify this unfairness immediately.
