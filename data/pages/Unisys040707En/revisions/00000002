Media reports LZW-Compression is finally patent-free, so we can encode/decode GIF images in our applications.

[[ErikJosefssonEn| Erik Josefsson]] cautions:

I talked to Modiano, UNISYS representative in MÃ¼nchen.

The patent EP129439 has expired according to some german computer magazine. Which seems to be true (date of filing 18-06-1984):[[http://register.epoline.org/espacenet/regviewer?AP=EP19840304111|"High speed data compression and decompression apparatus and method"]]

But the patent EP0800726 expires only in 2015:

[[http://register.epoline.org/espacenet/regviewer?AP=EP19950943914|LZW DATA COMPRESSION USING AN ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY]]
[[http://ofi.epoline.org/view/GetDossier?dosnum=95943914?=en#|EPO Dossier]]

Modiano is not paying the renewal fees, that is probably done by UNISYS themselves.
