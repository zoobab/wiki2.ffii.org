== Power-to-the-Parliament domain registration ==

 * DnsPttp0507En: FFII has registered the domains power-to-the-parliament.org et al. Configuration of power-to-the-parliament.org will be handled by our admin team. the *.eu domains have also been pre-registered and will have to be confirmed as soon as the .eu TLD is officially launched.

== Some things to do ==

 * [[EmDank0507En| Current thank you page]] is very rudimentary
 * The power-to-the-parliament.org domain is available to be used for thanking.
 * [[Cpedu0507En| Call for Action IV]]: rally behind 21 cross-partisan amendments
 * [[ParlTrans050705En| EP Speech transcriptions]] to be completed
 * More systematic commemoration needs to be worked on.  Various audiences need books about the software patent fight put on their table.  FMueller has been working on a book for the politically interested masses.  Another one for patent judges is needed. note(arebenti): consider http://www.bod.de/ for conference proceedings. Lenz also published there afaik.
