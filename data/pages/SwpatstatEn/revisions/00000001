== Outline ==

Governments are among the most active centers of pro-patent lobbying, because the governmental patent institutions control the legislative process based on their community's belief system, without much effective challenge from other agencies or the public.

A prominent case of conflict within governments is in pharmaceuticals: one branch encourages patents to stimulate innovation (which they probably often really do in the case of pharmaceuticals), while another branch tries to cut government spending by refusing to reimburse patient costs for patented medicines.
