Campaign for Creativity's new lobbyist, Hugo Shanahan, is asking MEPs what they think about the software patent directive in a letter where the MEP can tick two boxes:

 1. I support a Directive on the continued patentability of computer implemented invetions.

        I AGREE         [ ]
        I DO NOT AGREE  [ ]

 2. Intellectual property is an important component in supporting the growth of Europe's economy.

        I AGREE         [ ]
        I DO NOT AGREE  [ ]

The letter also invites the MEP to meet representatives of the Campaign for Creativity to discuss why they support the directive.
