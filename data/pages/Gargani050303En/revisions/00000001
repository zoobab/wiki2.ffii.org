 Subject: proposal on a directive of the Parliament and the Council
 regarding the patentability of computer-implemented inventions -
 2002/0047 (COD)

 President,

 I have taken note of the response of President Barroso to your letter
 of 24 February regarding the request of the Legal Affairs Committee
 for a renewed referral of the proposal regarding the patentability of
 computer-implemented inventions (COM (2002) 0092 - COD 2002/47).

 The Legal Affairs Committee, exercising the rights which have been
 given to it by the rules, has the intention to continue its work on
 this matter and to look more deeply into the implications of Mr.
 Barroso's reply about the ongoing legislative procedure.

 Indeed, we have the intention to discuss this during the meeting
 of the Legal Affairs Committee which should take place on 7 March in
 Strasbourg, if the authorisation which has been asked from you regarding
 its taking-place is confirmed.

 Additionally, I have to inform you that we have asked the opinion of
 the Legal Services in order to know until exactly which stage of the
 codecision procedure the European Commission can withdraw or modify
 its proposal.

 Most sincerely,

 Giuseppe GARGANI
