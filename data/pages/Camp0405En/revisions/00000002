A lobby group for strong enforcement of broad exclusion rights, calling itself [[http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/issues_so.htm|Campaign for Creativity]], is [[http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/action.htm|attempting to find some people with real-life sob stories]].

The campaign site portrays the opponents of software patentability as a handful of ideologues
who are trying to deprive creators of the legitimate fruits of their work.  It does not give a single give any name or web reference of this handful of ideologues, who must be extremely powerful, since the site claims that the European Parliament voted for harmful amendments, which "destroy the incentive to create new software", just to "appease" this group.

A professionally designed web page, many people will actually buy it but 
this site also proves that the pro-swapt lobby is neither naive nor 
honest and will do anything it takes to win this, including actively and 
openly promoting misinformation.

  "
  The pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (SB) has been one of the 
  most aggressive campaigners for the Directive, launching its own lobby 
  campaign even before EuropaBio existed. According to SB lobbyist Simon 
  Gentry, the company allocated 30 million ECU from the start for a 
  pro-Directive campaign.
  "

30 million ECU (Eur) for a pro-EU Life Patent Directive campaign from a 
single company, what should be the budget for the pro-SWPAT campaign?
