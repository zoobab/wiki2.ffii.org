Craig Opperman is one of the US patent lawyers with a particular interest in European legislation and, according to one publication, particularly close relations to the European Commission.  Yet Opperman can speak quite bluntly, without the doublespeak of European software patent promoters, about the matter.

== To Do ==

A few years ago there the Opperman website had a text which boasted
about "excellent contacts to the European Commission", which aroused a
stir on the [http://www.aful.org/wws/arc/patents patent at aful org forum] 
around 2001 and was later removed.  We need to find this again and check
whether we are talking about the same Opperman.

Not the same Opperman. I have no particular contacts with the EPO.
