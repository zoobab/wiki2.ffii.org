''There is an open oral proceeding at the European Patent Office (EPO) in MÃ¼nchen 16 November regarding the opposition filed by the Swedish Agency for Public Management (Statskontoret, a government agency).''

== Opposition Arguments  ==

It is very interesting to read the arguments. The defender of the patent 
agrees with EPO, but Statskontoret objects:

    "1. Concerning non-patentable matter, Article 52(2)(c) EPC"
    [...]
     "We are of the opinion that the method according to the patent
    specifies technical means for a purely non technocal purpose and for
    the processing of purely non technical information, and that these
    technical means does not confer a technical chartacter on any of the
    steps or on the methods as a whole."


== Things for FFII to do (?) ==

Statskontoret at least try to defend the subject matter test, but they make it weaker
than necessary.  A more elegant way of putting it might have been:

    We are of the opinion that the method according to the patent
    specifies technical means for processing data, and that these
    technical means does not confer a technical chartacter on any of the
    steps or on the methods as a whole.

It may be too late for intervening in the proceding, but we could try to file
some arguments (amicus curiae brief).
