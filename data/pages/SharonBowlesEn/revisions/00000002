Sharon Bowles is
 * a European Patent Attorney and computer architecture and communications technology are among her fields
   * [[http://www.cipa.org.uk/pages/parlcommittee|member of the Parliamentary Committee of]] '''CIPA, the "Charted Institute of Patent Agents"''' which is the special interest group of UK patent attorneys and her Committee lobbies the UK Patent Office and Westminster.
 * was running in the European Elections and will possilbly become an MEP in spring 2005
 * already a Vice President of the ELDR party,
 * an advisor to Chris Huhne MEP and likely to the rest of the [[ElectUkLib0405En| UK Libdems]], including likely Diana Wallis and Graham Watson too, she simply is the ''professional IP Expert'' inside the Party. It's also quite sure that she has good contact with [[http:ToineManders|Toine Manders]] and Elly-Ploij van Gorsel too.
 
[[http://www.makeitpolicy.org.uk/ITPolicyPaper.pdf|In this pdf]]
([[http://www.makeitpolicy.org.uk/Motion.html|web summary]])
she is listed as member of Working Group on Information Technology
of the [[ElectUkLib0405En| UK Libdems]].

She's a qualified European Patent Attorney running a professional partnership that she
founded over 20 years ago.  She specialises in writing, prosecuting and litigating patents
on "semiconductor fabrication, '''communications technology''', '''computer architecture''',
aeronautics, oil extraction and industrial fermentation".

She must have good ties to Brussels, and is no less than a vice-president of the ELDR
party bureau (the party's key day-to-day advisory committee).

Stood as #3 candidate for South-East England.
On [[http://www.chrishuhnemep.org.uk/news/12.html|a page detailing the candidates]]
the list leader Chris Huhne says:
''"The third candidate on the list, with an excellent chance of winning next year, is Sharon Bowles, a '''leading patent attorney''' who is '''well versed in european law'''."''

Indeed, she seems to have a leading lobbying role,
she is [[http://www.cipa.org.uk/pages/parlcommittee|member of the Parliamentary Committee of]]
"Charted Institute of Patent Agents" (CIPA) -
the professional and examining body for patent agents, also called attorneys in the UK.
The Institute was founded in 1882 and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1891.
It represents virtually all the 1600 registered patent attorneys
in the UK, whether they practise in industry or in private practice.
Total membership is over 3000 and includes trainee patent attorneys
and other professionals with an interest in intellectual property matters.
CIPA reports to the Controller-General of Patents,
Trade Marks and Designs at the Patent Office and
advises the UK Government and other international bodies
on policy and practice matters.

What is deeply worrying is that CIPA calls together with ITMA for the
[[http://www.cipa.org.uk/pages/whatsnew/article?62980D68-7365-4FC1-9CA9-B14DFE959CE8|appointment of patent attorneys as judges]]
(patent attorneys are better called agents agents, they are not
trained like attorneys, CIPA iselfs says "pagent agents, also called patent attorneys)

Chris Huhne and Emma Nicholson were re-elected;
Sharon Bowles replaced Chris Huhne as MEP after he was elected to the UK parliament in Spring 2005".

The letter she sent (included at the end) styled her just as
"senior advisor to Chris Huhne MEP", but with her background,
if the rest of the Lib Dems aren't using her as their lead
technical expert on this dossier, they'd be crazy.

Still, I suppose it at least means the ELDR have somebody who
can cope with as much technical detail as we care to throw at them.

Biography (2003)
http://www.eldr.org/images/upload2/cvsharonbowles.doc :
----
Sharon Bowles offers political, technical, legal and business expertise. She is expected
to become an MEP either this June  as one of the key Liberal Democrat gains  or by
promotion into a probable vacancy after the General Election, which is likely to be in
Spring 2005.

Sharon has been one of the Liberal Democrats high profile European campaigners and policy
makers for over 15 years. This will be her fifth major election campaign, her third as a
European Candidate. Sharon is co-chair of the Liberal Democrat International Relations
committee, a member of the Partys Federal Executive and until stepping down recently also
served on the Federal Finance and Administration Committee.

She is well known as a frequent participant at ELDR and LI Congresses, in recent years as
British delegation leader.

Within the Liberal Democrats she has served on many policy groups on topics including
science, genetic engineering, economy, civil liberties and presently on the group putting
the final touches to a paper on international trade. Often a leading speaker in debates at
Party Conferences, her speeches frequently attract significant media attention.

Academically Sharon is a solid state physicist and mathematician and researched on
semiconductors at Oxford University.

Professionally she is qualified as a European Patent Attorney and runs a professional
partnership that she founded over 20 years ago. Her own practice includes writing,
prosecuting and litigating patents for some of the worlds leading companies in the fields
of semiconductor fabrication, communications technology, computer architecture,
aeronautics, oil extraction and industrial fermentation.

''The role of a Vice-President can take different forms. It can be''
''to forge closer understanding with new parties, to give the Bureau''
''status, or to take on significant organisational work.''
''My pledge is to undertake hard work for the''
''future development of a truly pan-European party.''

 -----Original Message-----
 From: Sharon Bowles
 Sent: 1/9/2005 5:09 PM
 Subject: Computer Implemented Inventions

 Dear Mr .....

 I refer to your recent email to Chris Huhne MEP. I am his
 senior advisor and he has asked me to reply on his behalf.

 I am sorry this is a very long reply, but I hope you will
 get through it all. This is necessary for a full
 understanding because I am afraid that most of the reporting
 about what this legislation covers is very wrong. It is not
 quite clear why there is such a belief that it is intended
 to lead Europe down the US path because that battle, (such
 as it was) was won a long time ago and the legislation both
 makes it clear that Europe does not intend to do the same as
 the US and provides a defence against further attempts to
 force it that way. The Liberal Democrats have always opposed
 any extension to the current practice, but as you will see
 from this reply, that is not actually what is at issue.

 A full background and explanation is given below and I also
 attach a copy of the proposal (the Common Position)  and a
 PDF of an explanatory leaflet produced by the Patent Office.
 The Common Position does not change what has been
 established practice in the UK and Europe in recent years,
 which is and will continue to be more restricted than US
 practice. There never was an intention to allow what many
 have understood by the phrase 'software patents' and the
 Common Position now reflects this much better. The most
 important part of the Common Position is the Articles on
 pages 8 and 9 and in particular Articles 2, 4 and 4a which
 are all short and relatively simple.

 To proceed further the Common Position has to be passed by
 one of the Council meetings (any Council can do this) and
 then it goes back to the Parliament for a second reading.
 This to and fro is rather like between the UK Commons and
 Lords and is the normal process with nothing getting through
 until both agree. However the Polish Government has now
 changed its view and so there may be some further changes
 before it goes to the Parliament again or it could be
 dropped altogether.

 In the short term it makes no difference to the software
 industry as in the absence of the directive the status quo
 will be maintained and they are essentially the same. (My
 view as a European Patent Attorney is that the directive is
 probably slightly more restricting than the status quo).
 The risk then comes if Europe gets forced in the future via
 the WTO to accept something that is more like the US
 practice, which the current directive would stave off. Now
 to the detail...

 FULL EXPLANATION INCLUDING BACKGROUND

 Background. Patents are granted for inventions that are new,
 not obvious (have inventive merit) and are capable of
 industrial application. These may be products or processes
 (methods). Historically legislation has specifically
 excluded from patentability some fields such as mathematical
 methods, business methods and computer programs which at the
 time of their exclusion were considered entirely 'mental
 operations'  and therefore not capable of industrial
 application.

 The problem in recent years faced by Patent Offices and
 courts has been how to interpret  'computer programs'.
 This has become highly relevant, not just because of the
 increasing use of computer programs  but rather more because
 of the nature of things that are done nowadays by computer
 programs.

 In particular there are now substantial areas of technology
 where software has replaced conventional analog or digital
 circuits. Examples range from control of mechanical systems
 such as an internal combustion engine to control of packet
 switching in network routers, which underlies communications
 technology.

 To be effective a patent must cover the concept as well as
 the detail of the invention, so although a computer program
 listing might be given as an example of how to perform part
 or all of an invention, the patent claims (the bit that
 defines, legally, what is covered) would not be so specific
 and usually relate to the method steps that are implemented
 in the software. (This is why relying on copyright
 protection in the listing is not sufficient.) So the
 question arose of whether the exclusion  of 'computer
 programs' covered only listings or extended to claims to a
 method that is entirely put into operation through a
 program, i.e. is 'software or computer- implemented'.

 The European Patent Office adopted the practice that a
 'computer-implemented invention' was more than just a
 'computer program' and was patentable when there was
 also a technical effect because this fulfilled the
 fundamental requirement that a patent be  'capable of
 industrial application'. This interpretation was also
 followed by courts in the UK and Germany and is what we have
 had in Europe for some years. There has been pressure from
 the US for wider coverage as they have. This has been
 resisted (not least by parts of the profession and patent
 offices in Europe) but does seem to have given rise to
 lasting fear.

 More recently, some European countries expressed the opinion
 that their courts might take a different view on 'computer
 implemented inventions'  and deem patents that were to a
 method implemented by a program (as were being granted by
 the European Patent Office) invalid. At this stage
 clarification became desirable for a variety of reasons. One
 of these was that if the practice of the European Patent
 Office were not upheld in all courts, then the same logic
 that caused the EPO to regard these computer-implemented
 inventions as patentable (by virtue of being methods capable
 of industrial application and belonging to a field of 
 technology) could also be used to find against the EU in
 respect of its TRIPS obligations (Trade Related Intellectual
 Property Agreements which are part of the WTO agreements)
 under which patent protection for all areas of technology
 must be provided. This was only a theoretical breach, in
 that it had not actually happened, but coupled with the
 uncertainty that the pronouncements had made the Commission
 considered it would be best to confirm a uniform
 interpretation.
 
 The Proposals. The objective is to define the practice that
 the EPO has established as applicable in all countries. This
 would mean no change to the practice that the software 
 industry has experienced in recent years in Europe and no
 following of  wider  US practice.
 
 Unfortunately the Commission draft was not perfect in
 achieving the objective, and many continued to fear that a
 US type of patent coverage was intended as some discussion
 of that did take place at an earlier stage, but was
 rejected.
 
 Amendments passed by the Parliament, some of which were
 proposed by the software industry, unintentionally made
 matters worse. For example the amendments included several
 that attempted to redefine 'industrial application' and
 'technical effect' which are definitions that have been
 in use for decades with a substantial body of law behind
 them on a worldwide basis.  The new definitions may have
 solved a problem (that was not necessarily there) for the
 software industry but they also had an impact on other areas
 of electronics,  potentially excluding from patentability a
 range of electronic inventions, such as those implemented
 through processing of signal values, for which patentability
 had previously never been in doubt. This would have been a
 disaster for the European electronics and communications 
 industries, including many SMEs, and would have left the EU
 in an actual rather than just a theoretical breach of its
 TRIPS obligations.
 
 Now there is a 'Common Position' from the Council, which
 although it has not included all the wording of the
 amendments, has included enough to make it absolutely clear
 that for patentability a computer implemented invention must
 have a technical effect (i.e. beyond the ordinary
 interactions in a computer program) and the inventive merit
 must relate to that technical effect.
 
 Detail from the Common Position.  The Council Common
 Position specifically includes the amendment passed by the
 Parliament and supported by the Liberal Democrats that "In
 order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention
 must be susceptible of industrial application and new and
 involve an inventive step.  In order to involve an inventive
 step, a computer-implemented invention must make a technical
 contribution".
 
 Other important parts of  the Council Common Position are:
 
 In the Directive:

    - A computer program as such cannot constitute a patentable
 invention

    - Inventions involving computer programs,  whether
 expressed as source code, as object code or in any other
 form, which implement business, mathematical or other
 methods and do not produce any technical effects beyond the
 normal physical interactions between a program and the
 computer, network or other programmable apparatus in which
 it is run shall not be patentable.

    - A claim to a computer program, either on its own or on a
 carrier, shall not be allowed unless that program would,
 when loaded and executed in a computer, programmed computer
 network or other programmable apparatus, put into force a
 product or process claimed in the same patent  application.
 
 And in the accompanying explanation:

    - An algorithm is inherently non-technical and therefore
 cannot constitute a technical invention. Nonetheless, a
 method involving the use of an algorithm might be patentable
 provided that the method is used to solve a technical
 problem.  However, any patent granted for such a method
 would not monopolise the algorithm itself or its use in
 contexts not foreseen in the patent.
 
 -The mere implementation of an otherwise unpatentable method
 on an apparatus such as a computer is not in itself
 sufficient to warrant a finding that a technical
 contribution is present. Accordingly, a computer-implemented
 business method, data processing method or other method in
 which the only contribution to the state of the art is
 non-technical cannot constitute a patentable invention.
 

 -The mere implementation of an otherwise unpatentable method
 on an apparatus such as a computer is not in itself
 sufficient to warrant a finding that a technical
 contribution is present. Accordingly, a computer-implemented
 business method, data processing method or other method in
 which the only contribution to the state of the art is
 non-technical cannot constitute a patentable invention.
 
 We do not yet know what amendments may be proposed when the
 legislation returns to the Parliament, but on balance it is
 probably better to accept the common position than to amend
 it. Indeed rejection is better than amendment if they repeat
 the last attempts. The disadvantage of rejection is that the
 matter would eventually come back again and could end up
 worse if it is done under WTO pressure rather than now under
 our own volition.
 
 In addition to what the directive actually covers, many have
 mixed in comments about particular patents (often US ones
 rather than European ones).US and Europe must not be mixed
 up, we have different laws. Unfortunately even in Europe
 mistakes are sometimes made about granting patents for
 something that turns out to be trivial. There are remedies
 for this and it should not be used to confuse other issues.
 In general the European Patent Office aims to keep the level
 of inventive merit high.
 
 I am sorry this is so long, but I do hope that you have
 found it informative. Please do contact me again if you
 require any further information.
 
 Yours sincerely

 Senior Advisor to Chris Huhne MEP
