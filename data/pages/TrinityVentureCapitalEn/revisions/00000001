''An Irish venture capital company which lobbied the Irish government and Parliament in favor of software patents in 2004.'' 

 * http://www.tvc.com/, http://www.trinity-vc.ie/
 * a company said to be created by graduates of [:TrinityCollegeEn: Trinity College] (TBC)
 * Their new employee Brian Caulfield, according to their website a computer science graudate from Trinity College, [:Dail0405En: intervened in the Irish Parliament (Dail) in 2004/05/07] to encourage the Irish Council Presidency to press software patentability through the Council and overrule the European Parliament's contrary vote of 2003/09/24, saying that without software patents investment in software R&D would decrease 

  Brian Caulfield (brian at tvc com) joined Trinity in June 2002. Brian is a Computer
  Engineer graduate from Trinity College Dublin. In 1992 Brian co-founded
  Exceptis Technologies where he was CEO and CTO. Exceptis developed
  dispute management software for the electronic / card payments sector
  that was sold to blue-chip banking customers in Europe, the United
  States and Asia. Exceptis was sold to Trintech Group (NASDAQ: TTPA) in
  November 2000. Brian has co-founded two other venture capital backed
  software start-ups, Similarity Systems and Prediction Dynamics. Brian
  represents Trinity on the Boards of AePONA and SteelTrace.


Trinity VC appears to be unrelated to Trinity College -- in particular,
it is ''not'' the college tech transfer company.

Trinity claims currently to be managing investments of EUR 163 million,
typically investing between EUR 1m and 6m in an initial investment with
up to EUR 15m available over a number of investment rounds. [From the "our
story" page]

From the member information pages of the [http://www.ivca.ie/members.html Irish Venture Capital Association]
this appears to make Trinity VC one of the few very big players in the
Irish VC market.

With the exception of a very small number of players on this scale,
managing tens of millions of Euros, most venture capital appear to be a
lot smaller.
