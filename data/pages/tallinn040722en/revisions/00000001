That was kewl!
Because of the many road works on the way from Riga to Tallinn, the speakers arrived nearly one hour later than expected. Fortunately, the audience was very patient and there were about 150 people waiting for [http://stallman.org Dr. Richard Stallman] ([http://fsf.org FSF]), Marco Schulze ([http://ffii.org FFII Germany] & CEO of a [http://www.NightLabs.de German SME]) and Christian Engström ([http://ffii.se FFII Sweden]).

=== 1st speech - Dr. Stallman: How Software Patents Hamper Software Development  ===
RMS explained in a funny and easy to understand way how harmful software patents are. He [http://gibuskro.lautre.net/patents/slide13-0.html quoted the Economist] and compared the patent system to a lottery. This way he made the argumentation of patent proponents understandable as these people publish the same kind of advertisement for software patents as it is done for a lottery: Highlighting the unlike advantages while hiding the very probable disadvantages - in regard to software patents more ''catastrophes'' than just ''disadvantages''.

=== 2nd speech - Marco Schulze: Economic Effects Of Software Patents  ===
Unfortunately, time was very short, because the speakers had to get the last flight to Helsinki. Thus, Mr. Schulze dropped his speech and added only some remarks on the speech of Mr. Engström.

His presentation about the bad impact of software patents onto economy is available here:

=== 3rd speech - Christian Engström: What is going on in Brussels and what is FFII doing  ===
Because of the short time, Mr. Engström could not set up his notebook for the presentation. Thus, the white board was used and he explained how legislation in Brussels works and where the directive about software patentibility is currently standing. Mr. Schulze added that it was not yet too late to change the Council's decision, because May 18th was only a pre-decision (the final one is expected at the end of September). Both emphasized how easy it is to get politically active, because 1st most MEPs are very open for input from their constituents and 2nd the people on the [http://www.ffii.org FFII] mailing lists are helping to get the first steps done.
