''Sometimes it's not easy to find out the reason why a machine is slow.  The statistics page should give an impression about the current state and (much more valuable) development of the parameters over time.''

Most of the stats should be self-explanatory. "Interrupts ide" and "eth" means accesses to the harddisk and ethernet device. This does not say something about the actual transferred data / bandwidth, but it gives an impression whether there is high or low activity. "Apache" is gathered from the "Total accesses" (a.k.a. "Hits") value of Apache's /server-status.
