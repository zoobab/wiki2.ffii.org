''The Hague, 3 July 2006. Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) unanimously concluded last Thursday that the European Commission has no competence to propose a directive to criminalise intellectual property infringements. The Parliament submits that the Commission does not present any evidence that the directive is even needed at all, and that it interprets a recent European Court of Justice judgment overly broadly.''

----

The Commission can only propose a directive concerning criminal measures with the European Parliament as co-legislator in this case if the measures are essential for the realization of the single market. The Dutch Parliament dryly remarks that the Commission not even attempts to argue that a distortion in trade between member states would occur without this law, and concludes that therefore "any and all factual support" for the directive is missing.

The Parliament notes that the directive would only harmonise some penalties, but that there is no indication that criminals would choose the jurisdiction with the lowest penalties to operate from. Indeed, it is known that the chance to be caught plays a much bigger role, but the Commission has no say over the generally low prosecution priorities for IP infringements. The Dutch Parliament thinks that more exchange of information among member states would be much more effective than these disproportionate punishments.

Only recently, the Commission gained any competence at all to propose criminal measures without member states having a veto, due to the European Court of Justice judgment (C-176/03). With this directive, it seems the Commission is trying to expand the boundaries of its competence further by ignoring the edge conditions of said verdict.

FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: ''"The European Commission and the member states are now in the process of circumscribing competence: How far can the Commission go? In this power struggle the Dutch Parliament made its statement: the Commission went much too far. Earlier Dutch minister of Justice Donner had already stated he was not 'pleased'."''

Jonas Maebe, FFII board member, concludes: ''"The stated aim of the directive is to combat counterfeiting and piracy, but the directive goes much further. Even companies which merely use properly licensed software can be criminalised, since such use is intentional, commercial and can infringe on software patents. We hope that the Dutch Parliament's strong condemnation will wake up people and parliaments all over Europe."''


## The Commission can only make directives with criminal measures together with the European Parliament if both the objective of the Community and the measures are essential. The objective in this case is the realisation of the single market, this presupposes that without the directive  a distortion in trade between member states would occur. According to the Dutch Parliament this is not the case. It is not certain that more procedural means and sanctions are needed, prioritizing and exchange of information may  be more important. The Parliament also observes that the Commission does not state that criminals would go to the member state having the lowest penalties, thus all actual foundation is missing. The criminals would soon become punishable in the member state having the higher penalties anyway. Additionally the Parliament mentions a directive on civil enforcement of "intellectual property rights" currently being implemented by the member states. The high compensations of legal costs may work as punitive damages, and thus can be seen as sanctions.  

## The proposed directive would make all intentional commercial scale infringements of "intellectual property rights", including patents, a criminal offence. Since it is well known that it is impossible to write software without infringing any software patents, the directive will criminalise the entire software sector.

## Professional software users may violate patents even if they own a valid copyright license. Since professional use of software is intentional and on a commercial scale, such use will also be covered by the directive's terms.

== Background information ==

 * Full name of the directive: Directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights, 2005/0127 (COD)

 * English translation (by the FFII) of the conclusion of the adopted text: 

 Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) conclude that no competence
 has been granted to the Community for the intended action's desired aim. Both Chambers
 have nonetheless - unnecessarily - submitted the directive in question to the
 principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and concluded that the proposal fails to
 meet these tests."

 * Original Dutch conclusion (nr KST98457):

  Beide Kamers der Staten-Generaal concluderen dat voor de na te streven doelstelling
  van het voorgenomen optreden geen bevoegdheid aan de Gemeenschap is toegekend.
  Niettemin hebben beide Kamers onderhavig voorstel  ten overvloede  onderworpen
  aan de beginselen van subsidiariteit en proportionaliteit en geconcludeerd dat het
  voorstel daaraan niet voldoet."
