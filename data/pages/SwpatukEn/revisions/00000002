The United Kingdom's patent matters are run nearly exclusively by the UK Patent Office which has been a relentless promoter of software patentability in Europe since the 1970s.

Since the law on both sides of the Atlantic has found it impossible to legislate any meaningful difference between hardware and software then this implies that the difference between the idea behind an invention and the invention itelf has become immaterial. Therefore, in software, technology and knowledge coincide; i.e. there is no meaningful difference between "software as such" and its computer implementation. The law does not know the difference between an invention and knowledge because this difference has disappeared. This means that to patent software is to patent knowledge. 

Broadcasting this to cultural institutions or media would be a pertinent tactic. As a general law of morality, the quickest way to change is always the longest way around. Undermine the moral case for software patents.
