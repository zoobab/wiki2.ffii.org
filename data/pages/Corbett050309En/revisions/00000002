  The so-called "software patents directive" is currently at the legislative stage in the European
  Union.
  This issue is far from settled as there is a considerable difference of views between the European
  Parliament's first reading position and the position reached in the Council. The Council's position
  has just been formally adopted, but with growing reticence among some national governments.
  The text can only become law if it is approved in identical terms by both the Council (national
  ministers from each country) and the European Parliament, with up to three readings in each
  institution.
 
  My position is as follows:
  
  * I am not in favour of patenting of software as in the US.
  * Europe needs a uniform legal approach to stop the drift towards extending patentability to
    areas which would not have been traditionally allowed, and to stop patentability of pure
    business methods, algorithms or mathematical methods.
  * Software products as such must not be patented.
  * Opensource software must be allowed to flourish and this Directive must not have adverse
    effects on opensource software and small software developers.
  * Patents and the threat of litigation must not be used as an anti-competitive weapon to squeeze
    out small companies.
