[http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/34822.html 2004-06-29 Shocking Behavior and Smart Open-Source Policy]:"Smart policies are not written by attorneys in a vacuum. They need input from developers and business teams who have done their due diligence. Be smart. Do your homework ahead of time, well before drafting your open-source corporate policy. If you do, the chances are good you won't be "shocked" to learn that your policy may not be relevant at all."

What is needed is some sort of downstream constraint to prevent the "proprietization" of biotechnology. Because copyrights are not implicated much in biotech, the downstream constraint should probably be based in '''patents'''. While obtaining a patent is much more expensive than obtaining a copyright, the cost of protection in either case would typically be only a small fraction of the cost of making the development in the first place. 

[http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/34487.html 2004-06-15 Can Sun Emulate Linux by Open-Sourcing Solaris?]: "Another is that Linux is licensed under a "modified GPL  license." Because the text of the GPL is arguably ambiguous, the interpretation of the terms by different licensors creates legally different licenses from the same words. Under the modified GPL license, it is not clear exactly when a derivative work is created. "

[http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/33968.html 2004-05-25 GPL: Viral Infection or Just Your Imagination]: "Most of us are afraid of getting infected with a virus, whether it comes from a common cold or an attachment in our e-mail. [..] Just as a computer virus cannot jump out and infect a person, license terms that apply to one software program cannot simply jump to another software program. The viral nature of open-source licensing nearly always applies to the General Public License. This is in part due to the terms of the GPL  and also partly due to the position statements made by the authors of the GPL.
