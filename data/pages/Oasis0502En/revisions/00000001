''February 2005 -- The OASIS consortium, a group of companies that is trying to work out standards for e-business on the web, has adopted a patent policy document that allows OASIS to adopt standards that can be used only on condition of payment of patent royalties.  Such a polich would exclude free/opensource software.  Various players from the FS/OSS field are calling for a boycott of OASIS.  A conflict that erupted in W3C a few years ago is reappearing in OASIS.''
