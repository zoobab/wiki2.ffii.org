IPR = Intellectual Property Rights

whatever that means, it is however very questionable!

Who can obtain property on "Intellectual" achievements?

Are such acchievements not only made possible by "Intellectual" efforts and
"Intellectual" accomplishments from many others?

Are universities not institutions which are condemned to infringe such "Rights" on a daily basis?
And every scientist in research and development, if someone got such a "Right" by a sloppy
way of working within a national office has to fight against it?

A vast area for many discussions and as such only possible and thinkable 
under a fundamentally capitalistic regime in justice and economy.

This does NOT signify, that patents are NOT allowed, but ONLY for clearly defined, 
technical inventions; emphasizing the term "technical" in this context once again.
