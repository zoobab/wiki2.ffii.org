''17 April 2005 -- FFII has received permission from Dr. Karl Friedrich Lenz, Professor of European Law in Tokyo University, to publish a version of his legal analysis of the European Patent Convention, Article 52, in translation. The EPC is the treaty that governs the European Patent Office (EPO) and it is the reinterpretation of EPC 52 within EPO institutions which has led to its current practice of patenting software. Lenz reaches the conclusion that the Technical Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office have for some time now regularly granted patents on computer programs as such and are showing a disturbing willingness to substitute their own value judgements for those of the lawmaker.''

== Why Lenz's paper matters ==

The main merit of the Lenz paper lies in the analysis of the phrase "software as such", derived from EPC 52(3), which carries a certain interpretation of the EPC along. According to Lenz' analysis the interpretation of the EPO's Technical Board of Appeal was a misinterpretation which cannot be derived using the common methods of legal interpretation from EPC 52.

In the current political debate the phrase "software as such" is often quoted without knowledge of its original context. The recent [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ Council proposal] even has a magical Bolkestein insert which says "software as such" shall not be patentable.

  Article 4.1 A computer program as such cannot constitute a
  patentable invention.

It shifts the meaning of the written law's "programs for computers ... as such" to unexecuted source, object code or an instance of a program which no one ever intended to patent. 
Terminology in the software patent debate is often very vague and complicated. Nobody can really explain what the difference of "software" and "software as such" actually is. Hartmut Pilch explains why: "This is a bit like taking the ''it'' in ''it is raining'' out of context and asking what mysterious entity this ''it'' is that is raining there." 

According to Lenz the Technical Board of Appeal in its [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/epo-t971173/ IBM/Computer program] decision were wrong in ruling that there are two classes "software" and "software as such" in the European Patent Convention.  Moreover Lenz rejects the teaching as unfounded that "as such" has to be understood in the sense that computer programs as such are computer programs without a technical character. In his conclusion, Lenz criticises the decisions of the Technical Board of Appeal as exceeding its competences and changeing the meaning of law by its interpretation, in effect exceeding the scope of the written law. As Professor Lenz puts it:

  However the assertion that the limitation of the exclusion of software
  from patentability to software as such in paragraph 3 served the
  purpose of promoting technical progress by acknowledging patentability
  in the light of new developments in information technology is not
  convincing. If the legislator had intended such a purpose, he would
  not have introduced the exclusion in paragraph 2 in the first
  place. The assumption of a legal purpose that matches the desired
  result is not a correct use of the method of interpretation from
  purpose, but it does clearly demonstrate the willingness of the
  Technical Boards of Appeal to substitute their own opinions for those
  of the legislator.

Lenz's observation are shared by many writers of legal analyses,
including as Reiman PA Reimar König, editor in chief of the German
patent attorney magazine Mitteilungen für Patentanwälte, who
[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/grur-koenig01/ criticised] 
that the EPO decisions "do violence to the law".  Klaus
W. Melullis, presiding judge of the patent senate of the German
Federal Court of Justice approvingly quotes Lenz's analysis in an 
[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/mellulis02/ article of 2002] 
which reaches similar conclusions.
