== But I want a B-item  ==

Welcome, attentive reader! (If you have followed here, you really know the options.)

If you can get your friendly government to get a B-item, then go ahead! The renewed referral ("restart") in Parliament is a measure to kill the Council text. This either can be done by renewed referral in Parliament (that is advertised here) or B-item (that is no so much advertised at least this week). We are going in parallel, both ways are fine, and if you can get your government to get a B-item, that is welcome too, and which way is to be chosen is decided on a first-come, first-served basis ...
