''The Europen Commission and European Patent Office started their software patent legislation project in 1997 with the explicit intention of "harmonisation" with the US and Japan and using business method patents to stimulate economic growth.  Later the wording was changed but the substance remained.  We show this for the proposal of the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Commission of July 2003, which was subsequently overruled by the Plenary of the Parliament.  The same is however true of the proposal of the Council's Political Agreement of May 2004, whose wording is largely identical to that of JURI.''
