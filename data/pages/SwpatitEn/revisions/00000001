In Italy the forces of the patent movement are weaker than in Germany or UK.  The most important stronghold seems to be the federation of employers Confindustria with its "Intellectual Property Committee".  This group has intervened many times in favor of software patents but did not have decisive influence on the government, even less so on the Italian members of the European Parliament.
