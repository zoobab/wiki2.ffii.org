This page is supposed to be more or less for internal communication. It's '''not''' supposed to be a place that companies or indivuals can be pointed to.

== Support as a company ==

 * You can give public statements
 * You can talk to politicians
 * You can organize events with other companies and organizations
 * You can support events
 * You can contact friendly companies
 * You can become a member of the FFII
 * You can use relations to organize help (e.g. sys admins, artists, etc.)
 * You can donate money
 * You can donate goods
 * You can donate human resources (e.g. for administrative tasks)

== Support as an individual ==

 * You can do pretty much everything that a company could do, but of course on a somewhat smaller scale
 * If a member in a political party then you can make use your contacts

== How to encourage people ==

 * Tell them something like "If you don't like something of FFII, help us! We can't do better without having more resources (humanly - personal, good-wise e.g. computing resources) and funding-wise." I want to cite Larry Lessig from his speech at OSCON: "Don't help us by wining, help us by writing on a cheque: 'Please be more...'; send mail to __proj-help at ffii org__ for help offers."
 * "If you have a complete resource to offer (eg. a new wiki system - like a mediawiki install so that we can replace kwiki for example) please don't write to us yes ... is great, use that, but send us the host name of the server which we can relyably use (backed up and you restore it from an always current backup if needed), hosted and administered and your contact information so that we can contact you when we have questions."
