The list the jury has drawn up covers inventions from all the '''fields of technology''' in which the EPO granted European patents between 1991 and 2000. It granted over 380 000 patents in that period, so in making their choice the jurors drew on the technical expertise of the Office's 3 500 patent examiners. Prizes are to be awarded in six categories, and three candidates have been nominated for each of them.

As President Pompidou puts it: "The panel's selection is clear evidence that major R&D achievements, especially in marketable high-tech fields, are nowadays primarily the result of teamwork and co&#8209;operation. Obtaining patent protection for this research is a key to successful product marketing."

Lifetime achievement nominations:
