 * 2004-09-29 Viviane Reding - Hearing ([[http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/audicom2004/resume/040929_reding_EN.pdf|official summary]] ):"The question of patent law, also important for industry  particularly the patentability of computer-implemented inventions  was raised by several Members, including David HAMMERSTEIN MINTZ (Greens/EFA, ES) and Esko SEPPÄNNEN (GUE/NGL, FI). The MEPs defended open source software as a way of offering greater access to technology for everyone as it cost less. Furthermore it was a way of encouraging young people to be innovative. Mrs Reding said she was very aware of this problem, which brought copyright into conflict with freedom of use. Ultimately, she said, it is a commercial problem and we have to reconcile interests. She reminded Members that the directive on the subject would return to Parliament for second reading after it had passed before the Council of Ministers."
