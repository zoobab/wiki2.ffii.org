The KDE (K Desktop Environment, a graphical user interface for Linux) based open source messenger Kopete is protesting by means of a net strike. Instead of the regular main page you can find information about the EU software patents directive in particular, as well as about the immensely broad coverage of general instant messenger concepts by European and US patents from Microsoft, AOL and !iKimbo. They also provide a pointer to an external and more extensive list of patents granted by the USPTO.
