 * Microsoft has not paid Timeline the sub-licensing royalties, i.e. it has preferred to expose its customers to the patent risk, apparently hoping that the patents would fall or that Timeline would find it difficult to bring the customers to court.
 * It appears from the PRs and news reports that Timeline did not apply for patents in Europe, although a large part of their business is in UK. We have yet to research the patents concerned.
