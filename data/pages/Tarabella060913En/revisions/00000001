  WRITTEN QUESTION E-3526/06
  by Marc Tarabella (PSE) 
  to the Commission

  The European Patent Office (EPO) has emphasised that defending a suit
  would cost two to three times as much as doing so within a single Member
  State.

  1.	Can the Commission provide an analysis of the structure of the costs
  of a typical suit under the future judicial system set up as part of the
  European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA)?

  2.	Does the Commission have an impact study into how small and
  medium-sized businesses would proceed (e.g. out-of-court settlement with
  the patent holder etc.) in the event that the costs of a suit were
  doubled or even trebled?

=== Answer (unofficial English translation) ===

  Answer give by Mr. McCreevy
  in the name of the Commission
  (15.9.2006)

  With its question, the honorable member is interested to learn about the
  foreseen litigation costs under the European Patent Litigation Agreement
  (EPLA - currently in preparatory status) and their impact on small and
  medium-sized enterprises.

  The project on the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) is based
  on an initiative of the contracting states to the European Patent
  Organisation, to which the European Community is not a contracting party,
  and is being worked out y a workgroup on litigation, without
  participation of the Community. As the honorable member has mentioned,
  the European Patent Office (acting as a secretariat for the workgroup on
  litigation) has performed an impact assessment concerning the EPLA's
  influence on European patent litigation. It is consequently not up to the
  Commission to analyse the cost structures under the EPLA, nor to justify
  the costs calculated by the European Patent Office.

  The Commission is currently in the process of examining the issue of the
  draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) and the possibility of
  moving the project forward in the context of its consultation on the
  future patent policy in Europe. The consultation was launched on 16
  January 2006 and proved to be a huge success, generating over 2 500
  answers from interested circles. A public hearing took place on 12 July
  2006. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the responses and
  drawing its conclusions. Naturally, the Parliament will be informed about
  the Commission's findings and recommendations as soon as they have been
  finalized.
