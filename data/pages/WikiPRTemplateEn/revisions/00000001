<fill-in-notes-on-late-updates-here>

=== Content-Hints to Translators ===

 * check exact national match for EU institution/law terminology such as "directive", "presidency", "council"
 * shortcuts like SMU or R&D should get translated into native versions
 * it should be taken sufficient care for using national wording (especially for technical, economical, political and law terms) rather than international wording even if the original wording is somewhat known to locals
 * phrases like "no software patents -- power to the Parliament" have been chosen under shortness constraints; those headlines will strongly vary from language to language; different ways of shortening a base meaning similar to "all lawmaking power to elected legislators" have to be found for some language versions of the document
 * document names like "Call for Action" should be translated into national version, but the original title should show up the first time it occurs in the body
 * abbreviations such as CTO, CEO, etc. that dont have a national counterpart should be translated into long name national version, but the original shortcut should show up the first time it occurs in the body
