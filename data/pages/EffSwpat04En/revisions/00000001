== Outline ==

 * EFF Patent Busting Project: http://www.eff.org/patent/ (includes the official statement of EFF)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has announced that it will submit evidence to the US Patent Office 
in an effort to prove that 10 particularly obnoxious software patents relate to ideas that were not new
at the claimed date of invention.

At the same time the Public Patent Foundation is [:PubpatSwpat04En: also trying to bust a few software patents].

The problem with the EFF project and the statements of Jason Schulz are that the limit the badness to a few patents which caused press articles which said that Free and Open Source Software has to live with patents and patents should be get in defense, which is only the second-best way to deal with the problem, which will also not work e.g. against companies like Microsoft.

[:HartmutPilchEn: Hartmut Pilch] comments:
FFII has [:Amaz040125En: filed opposition against an Amazon patent at the EPO] to "get some exercise" in this game,
but never saw this as an effective means of solving the problems caused by software patents.  On the contrary, FFII entered
this game only after another group, [:SwpatgievDe: GI e.V.], had used these patents for a PR action in an effort to prove that current patent office caselaw was just fine for coping with "bad patents".  Unfortunately some of the rhetoric of EFF reminds me of this tactic.  Like FFII, EFF can't resist the temptation to go for a ride on the wave of publicity which surrounds some of the well-scandalised patents. But unfortunately, EFF is not using this publicity to help educate the public.

== European Cousins ==

Some of the objected patents, e.g. the one of [:SwxaiAcaciaEn: Acacia], have cousins granted by the European Patent Office.

To find out about such kinship relations, take the US patent numbers from EFF and research for patent families

== General discussion  ==

The most troubling statement on the side of EFF is:

Jason Schultz, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
works to protect human rights and liberties online, told us he too thought
software patents aren't entirely without merit.
'/While I'm skeptical that patents are truly necessary to promote progress in the software field, they do have some utility./
''For instance, patents are often a good source for documenting the history of innovation in a field or to help teach others how to perform a particular technique.''
/Again, as long as the patent owners aren't using them to hinder competition or exploit others, I'm not yet ready to banish them completely./'

A programmer's statement on this could be:

Before I started looking at software patents sharply, I was also under
the impression that there could be some which might be good - like said
by Schultz - because of the function of documentation.

But after listening to the Speech of Richard Stallman on Software patents,
it becomes clear that there is no merit in software patents, and looking
at the patents really only confirms this.

Since Schultz is a lawyer, it's not enough for him to just look
at the patent registry and see the latest patents and patent applications
from e.g. Microsoft, because as he is (I guess) not from the engineering camp.

I was looking a while now and never found something teaching me something
which have justified looking thru the patents. There must some reasons
why programmers don't read patents:
 * there are too many of them, you can't read them all
 * what's described are simple and old ways of doing of which anybody working on it would have thought of it alone.

And if there is something really intelligent advanced which can't
be given away, the relevant part can be kept closed, which is not
in the spirit of Free Software but at least better than patenting
it, making it possible to the owner of the patent (which can change)
to prohibit competition by Free Software in this area and on the
same data format.

It's not these 10 patents which are dangerous, it's the then-thousands
of them with which could potentially hurt you and for which you have
also no means of finding them, forget about a effective means of
licensing, but and here comes the second isse which he overlooks,
which at threat already when there is the possiblity that somebody
>>might<< start "using them to hinder competition or exploit others".

Also, each patents can eventually fall into the hands of somebody
who wants (or has) to use it, as we've seen in numerious examples,
even if the original patent holder only wanted to use it defensively.

Patents are dangerous, even if they are unloaded in the cupboard,
and you can only get safe of them in the software field by changing
the laws to not hand them out anymore (this is secondary, actually)
and change the environment for the others so that they can't shoot
anymore (which is the primary action).

This is the best thing which can be done - some things (like attacking
some) can help to create awareness of the problem - but if it must be
put to work in a way to help reaching the primary goal. The problem
of their enforability and not the problem that there is some number
of patents which might be dangerous. 

When we say that there are "<number>" patents, we don't say:
"Gee, these are stupid". No, we can cite many many computer
scientists which have looked at the models, one said: "The Models are broken".
They do the wrong thing:

Paul Newell, professor of computer science: '''Response: The models are broken, the models are broken!'''
