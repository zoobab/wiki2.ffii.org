= Analysis Slides 2005-01-25 vs. FFII official position =

 * unprofessional presentation, to much text
 * many different issues including such wacky concepts as a "digital divide"
 * slide 9
 Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions: All of Europe's
 innovators, including individual inventors, small and medium size
 enterprises (SMEs), as well as large multinational companies, require
 patents to protect their inventions. 

FFII agress that in many field of technology "inventors" need patents.

 This provides incentives to undertake R&D in Europe, promote licensing, and foster a climate that
 facilitates technology transfer. 

This is a common legal teaching. For the field of software however you have to provide evidence first that it really carries out these effects.

 Legal certainty in patent protection is a precondition for the industry to invest in software development. 

FFII agrees, software producers need legal certainty. The Parliament gave legal certainty with its proposal from the 1st reading.

 The new European Parliament will bear considerable responsibility with
 regard to the future of the Computer Implemented Inventions¬ù Directive

FFII agrees: The question whether Software patents will come into force in Europe is a maior structural landmark decision.


== Comment ==

Huisman implicit does assume that the software industry needed patent protection and that there is such a thing as a software invention. However he provides no substancial argument.
