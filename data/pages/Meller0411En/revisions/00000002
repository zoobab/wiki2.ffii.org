Two largely identical articles by Paul Meller, Brussels correspondent for IDG, report that the EU Council has once more postponed the adoption of its software patent agreement of May 18th as a "Common Position" and connects this to the Polish government's refusal to support this agreement.

== The Articles ==

 * 2004-11-23 EU [[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/22/business/patent.html|International Herald Tribune: EU software patent vote delayed for more debate]]
 * 2004-11-23 US [[http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&q=%22Europe+Delays+Vote+to+Unify+Patent+Rules%22+%22new+york+times%22&btnG=Search+News|New York Times: Europe Delays Vote to Unify Patent Rule]]

== Observations ==

 * Meller quotes a Polish Coreper diplomat who seems to be unhappy about his government's position and eager to weaken this position.  
 * Meller's news about the alleged postponement may be unrelated to the Polish initiative.  A postponement of the adoption had already been announced a fortnight ago.
 * Meller refers to FFII as a group of open-source advocates.  FFII has very little to do with advocacy of opensource/free software vs proprietary software and indeed is defending all copyright-based software business models.
