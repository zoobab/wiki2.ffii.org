''11 April 2005 -- the developers of a leading open source database found that the caching scheme which they had used infringed on an IBM patent.  In order to avoid legal risks or restrictions on the licensing of their database, they decided to remove this algorithm and use a more common, less performant scheme.  Database caching algorithms are patentable under the draft directive of the EU Council but not under that of the Parliament of September 2003.''
