The European Court of Human Right is able to complain against software 
patent at the European Court of Justice. They have a "suspensive" right 
if they win. It can let us the time Do you have ever think about it?

It can be an emergency tactic if there are no other options left
anymore. For now we should focus on the political part of the decision
making imho.

=== Florian MÃ¼ller agreed 2004-06-28 ===

Interestingly, there were a couple of remarks (from the patent lobby as well
as swpat critics) at the roundtable of the German Federal Ministry of
Justice last week which pointed in the direction of legal recourse against
whatever outcome of the political decision.  Some say it would be
unconstitutional to not allow for the patentability of software, and others
say that the patent system itself is questionable in constitutional terms
("might makes right").

No one will give up easily but we are far from giving up, I guess.
