==== Andrzej Odyniec (Macrosoft) ====

 * CEO of [[http://www.macrosoft.com.pl/|Macrosoft]]

introduces a mathematical model which explains why the patent system does not work for software, stresses that for him as an informatics pioneer and CEO of the older generation beliefs are unimportant, the important question is whether the system works.  It doesn't, and the model explains why.

=== Waclaw Iszkowski (PIIT) ===

 * [[http://www.piit.org.pl/|Polish Chamber of Information Technology and Telecommunications]]
 * Dr. eng
 * president of PIIT

 * experience shows that software patents are stupid and harmful, agree with previous speakers
 * BUT it is not enough to ban them in EU, solutions for US, JP, CN, IN etc must also be found to ensure that European companies are really safe when they publish things on the Internet and won't fined by US courts upon entry to the US. Political efforts are needed to protect EU interests in an international environment where in the mid-term software patents are still predominant.

=== Laurence Vandewalle ===

 * research policy advisor of Greens/EFA in European Parliament

 * in second reading, only JURI will report
 * as before, JURI will be dominated by servants of big business and lawyer world
 * they will present a further disguised, even more hypocritical version of the Council proposal, pretending that negotiations and compromises are going on
 * a massive effort is needed to make it clear to other !MEPs, especially newly elected ones, that JURI leaders cannot be trusted
 * in a third reading, things may become still more difficult, but we may at least be able to work without a JURI rapporteur
 * We can lose in a few months and will need years to win.
