We have the opportunity to get an article into Linux Plus magazine:

On LinuxTag 2004 we talked to Mrs. Strzelczyk, the Foreign Market Manager of Wydawnictwo Software. This company publishes diverse Linux magazines and also a Linux distribution (Aurox). What distinguishes these publications is that they are translated into several languages. The magazine Linux-Plus, for example, is published in five different languages (Polish, German, French, Spanish, and Czech). Accoring to Mrs. Strzelcyk, the software patent issue hasn't yet been the topic of an article in that magazine. She encouraged us to hand in a draft in german and english. Of course, before someone starts writing, she/he should check again with Wydawnictwo Software. Also, the contact to Wydawnictwo has AFAIK been submitted to a Polish FFII member, so it is wise to check that there is no overlap. If you are interested in submitting an article, please contact [[http://plone.ffii.org/Members/feklee|feklee]] for more information.
