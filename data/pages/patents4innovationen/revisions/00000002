Patents4innovation.org was a website started by a group around EICTA in autumn of 2004 for the purpose of lobbying the European Parliament to allow software patents.  It's main arguments consists in false representation claims: corporate patent lawyers masquerading as "the industry".  Some of the companies and associations initially listed by !Patents4Innovation.org as "sponsors" are known as opponents software patents.

The website is currently (June 2006) down.
