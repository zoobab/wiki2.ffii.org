= "Autumn" camp Markelo, The Netherlands (Sept 17-20, 2004) =

What makes 17 Sept so different to justify an exclusion from autumn? (Autumn starts 23 Sept)"): 

In the weekend of 17-20 september 2004, there will be a FFII/Vrijschrift autumn camp in Markelo, which will be held in the farmhouse next to [[http://koprensmorre.nl|Kop'ren Smorre]]. It's for supporters who want to learn more about software patent advocacy.

There's a room in the farmhouse that will be used for workshops, etc by about 30-50 people. The restaurant next door also contains some rooms, that might be useful. And it will be handy for food, etc.

In the farmhouse, there is an @home broadband internet connection (4 Mbit down, 512k up) and I will make sure there is a 10 mbit hub and wifi access point there. That's about it. Please bring your own wiring and further equipment.
