=  Urgent Action: help today to change Portugal's vote in EU Council! =

  Dear FFII supporter,

    On the next 23rd of September will be voted Project Resolution n.º 254/IX -
  - Against software patents in EU in defense of scientigfic and technological
  development, at the Parliament, proposed by MP Bruno Dias (PCP). This motion
  aims to invert the sad vote, favourable to software patents, by Portugal at
  the meeting of 17/18th May Council of EU Ministers.

    For this reason, it is urgent that you write a letter and send it by snail
  mail or fax (you can also send an email, but "non digital" contact has a lot
  more impact) to your favorite representatives asking them to support this motion
  even if proposed by an opposing party.

    If you can send this letter in name of your company, do it. It is important
  to point out that your company will also be affected.

    Good things to say include the rejection of software patents by almost 2900
  portuguese who subscribed the petition delivered to the EU parliament, EuroParls's
  proposal which clearly excludes software patents after a long study period, and
  you should include as an annex the Urgent Appeal available at
  http://swpat.ffii.org/xatra/cons0406/index.pt.html

    To help show our will, specially to the parties that compose the government,
  for an european software market free of software patents, it is necessary to
  make this small effort. Please, help us for this gesture is important and urgent.
