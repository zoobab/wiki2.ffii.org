Prof. Tamai quotes a set of patent claims from the SOFTIC symposium of 1993, where patent officials from JP, US and EU judged the patentability of an example algorithm at different levels of concretisation.  The European representative was more willing than his colleagues from US and JP to grant patents on abstract claims.
