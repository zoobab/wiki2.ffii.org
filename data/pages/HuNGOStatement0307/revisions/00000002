STATEMENT

We happily welcome the decision of Danmark, according to which monday in the Competitiveness Council of the European Union they will request for substantive negotiations of the software patent directive (directive on patentability of computer implemented inventions).

Besides other countries, the Hungarian government has also appended a unilateral statement to the may 18 text of the directiva, urging for better consideration of the interests of SMEs.

We ask the government to assist this goal with support of renegotiating the directive in the Council as a B-item.
