''2006-03-01:  "Patentanwaltskammer" (German Chamber of Patent Attorneys) strongly opposes a EU-Community patent. This is the message carried out by their contribution to the EU Community Patent Consultation. The opponents of a Community Patent mention several reasons why patent attorneys would dislike a community patent. Patentanwaltskammer fears the end of a judicial rule over the patent system. According to Patentanwaltskammer a Community Patent would mean a "Dissolution of the European Patent System". The EU-consultation is open for contributions of interested parties until march 31.''

 * [[http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/indprop/patent/consultation_en.htm|EU-consultation]]

== Positions of Patentanwaltskammer ==

 * Patentanwaltskammer expects a change of substantive rules by the EU and a legislative interference in case law. The granting procedures of the EPO may not be questioned.
 * The European Patent system shall be governed by a community of lawyers and judges
 * No desire to start "political" discussions about patent law, esp. in the field of software. 
 * Patent law does not have to serve common welfare objectives. Provisions for these objectives have to get codified in "special laws".
 * Patent law promotes competition
 * A European system for dispute resolution is needed

 * The Commission should withdraw its  proposal. Only EPLA, which is based on existing institutions, is deemed to be beneficial.
 * "A community patent based on a common policy objective has to be forcefully rejected. By these means no community patent can be created which is beneficial for commerce."

   * A central court was unable rule 800-1000 cases/year
   * No regional courts are proposed, a violation of the subsidiary principle.
   * Questions over language regime remain unresolved

 * No harmonisation by the EU is needed. Harmonisation is driven forward by conferences of patent judges.
 * Patent law has to remain case law-driven.
 * A Community Patent would effectively imply a "Dissolution of the European Patent System"
