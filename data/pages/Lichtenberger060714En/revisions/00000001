''Brussels, 14 July 2006 - Eva Lichtenberger MEP (Greens) has asked the Commission for a clarification concerning the second closed SME patent consultation the Commission held. She asks whether the Commission thinks it was appropriate to merge the results of this specifically selected set of'' !SMEs ''with the rest, and where the money used to carry out this consultation came from.''

  WRITTEN QUESTION by Eva Lichtenberger (Verts/ALE) to the Commission

  Subject: Data processing and consultation procedure on the Future of patent
  policy in Europe
   
  From 16 January 2006 to 12 April 2006, the European Commission carried out a
  public consultation on the future of patent policy. The preliminary findings of
  this consultation were been released on 5 July 2006. It appears that the
  Commission conducted a parallel consultation under the name of SME panel. The
  following website: http://www.eic.org.tr/Eng/duyuru_detay.aspx?ID=636 refers to
  a document transmitted by DG MARKT and DG ENTR to the network of European Info
  Centres (EIC) which says: DG MARKT-D2 launched some weeks ago an online
  consultation on patent systems. Nevertheless, taking into account the subject's
  complexity and the difficulties faced in obtaining answers directly from SMEs,
  DG MARKT considered that the SME Panel tool would be very useful because it
  would support and complete the results already obtained in the online
  consultation. [] The SMEs which are targeted with the questionnaire are:
  current patent holders, those who hold a patentable invention but who, for a
  particular reason have not sought the patent, SMEs who have been sued by patent
  holders for patent infringement, any other SMEs who have had to deal with the
  patent system.

  The public consultation was open to any SME without restricting criteria such
  as the ones mentioned above. Is it statistically exact to draw a graph where
  both sets of data are merged  as is the case in the table Sectors of industry
   Companies and industry associations replies' on page 6 of the preliminary
  findings?
  
  Does the Commission think that it is statistically correct to process different
  answers that have been received in two separate consultations carried out under
  different preconditions? What was the motivation for drawing a second sample
  from patent oriented SMEs in addition to the public consultation, and for
  subsequently merging these two results?
  
  In Ireland at least one EIC received funds for that purpose (see
  http://www.eic.ie/ipm/smepanels.htm): The Irish EIC Network has been given
  funding by the European Commission to run a series of SME Panels throughout
  Ireland to collect the views of SMEs on specific areas of EU policy. What was
  the total budget for that project and which budget line was utilised?
