Softwarepatents threaten innovation and employment

Origin: BVMW


Berlin  in the light of the pending decision on software-patents Mario Ohoven, president of the "Bundesverband mittelständische Wirtschaft" (BVMW) and the "Europäische Vereinigung der Verbände Kleiner und Mittlerer Unternehmen" (CEA-PME):

"The proposed law regarding software- resp. logic-patents diametrally opposes the interests of the, mostly medium-sized, german software companies. If this proposal became law without being changed, tens of thousands of jobs could be lost and a massive decrease in innovation, culminating in a complete halt of all innovation, could become reality.
The reason for this is that, by will of the EU council, not only procedures with technical relations, but also results and even ideas will be patentable. We therefore fear that software ideas will be declared a form of prohibited area (intellectually). Clearly the european patent protection needs a reform. Therefore, we support the general patentability of genuine technical novelties. However, it's not the aim of a technical development that is worthy of protection, but the way it is achieved. This protection can, however, also be ensured by the copyright laws. The EU council must take the objections made by the EU-parliament seriously. The proposed law in it's current form must under no circumstances be accepted."
