 * '''Frits Bolkestein''': "Patents are about solutions to technical problems and a patent has to cover the whole, not just a small part, of the solution to a problem. It is only infringed if the whole solution is used. It does not, therefore, monopolise every separate component part which contributes to the solution.", 23.9.2003
