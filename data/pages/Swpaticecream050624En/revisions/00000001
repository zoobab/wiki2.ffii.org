''24 June 2005 - An anonymous author has created a humorous fake flyer promoting all the "beneficial effects that software patents would have.''

The flyer takes a cue from [:CampaignForCreativityEn: CampaignforCreativity's] recent [:CampIcecream050601En: ice-cream debacle] and only gets better from there! We do not know the author of this document.
