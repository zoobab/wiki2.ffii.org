  WRITTEN QUESTION P-2518/06
  by Jaroslav Zv&#283;&#345;ina (PPE-DE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    Intellectual Property (IP) protection in Europe
  
  High-tech companies in Europe, particularly SMEs, are struggling on a
  daily
  basis to compete in the global marketplace.  To this end, the ICT
  industry
  is constantly having to support R&D for innovation in order to remain
  competitive and help the EU achieve the ambitious goals set out in the
  Lisbon Agenda.  However, the results are limited because the EU has
  still
  not been able to deliver on the Lisbon promises and ensure fundamental
  changes and improvements for the ICT industry. Consequently, the
  high-tech
  industry in the EU is lagging further behind global competitors,
  including
  China and the United States.

  One of the most crucial preconditions for the promotion of high-tech
  growth
  and employability in Europe is a business environment that provides for
  strong IP protection.  This would ensure that venture capital is made
  available, particularly for SMEs, and that creators are being
  sufficiently
  protected and nurtured within Europe.
  
  How will the Commission ensure that software developers in Europe are
  being
  properly protected? Will the Commission ensure patent protection and/or
  a
  workable litigation agreement, or at least complete harmonisation of
  substantive patent rules? Furthermore, when will the Commission propose
  new
  legislation to promote strong IP and patent protection in the EU?
