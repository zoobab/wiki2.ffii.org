''We need to collect addresses (with fax and phone) of Council politicians, members of parliament and other intermediaries for our supporters to write to.''

[[LtrConsRecv0406En| Many addresses]] have been collected in connection with the an earlier [[Cons0406En| Appeal]]. 

If you call the council secretariat before the meeting at 8h30, they can give you fax numbers of some delegations '''inside the council''' to deliver urgent messages (preferrably well-targeted ones, not round-robin faxes to all delegations).

It would also be a good idea to inform press agencies such as [[ReutersEn| Reuters]], [[AgenceFrancePresseEn| AFP]], [[DeutschePresseAgenturDe| DPA]], who have consistently been getting things wrong on such days in the past (e.g. writing that the directive is about allowing patentability of electronic household appliances but not software as such).
