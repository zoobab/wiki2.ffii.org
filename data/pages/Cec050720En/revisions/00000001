''20th July 2005 -- In a press release, the European Commission interprets the rejection of its directive by the European Parliament as a confirmation of the "status quo", defined by the practice of the European Patent Office.  The Commission extensively quotes pro-patent lobby group EICTA as representative of Europe's ICT industry and attributes the opposition to the directive to the US-based Open Source And Industry Alliance (OSAIA).  EICTA is quoted as saying that the Parliament's decision was a wise one.''

The text avoids any mention of FFII.  Nor is there any mention of the 21 cross-party amendments, whose imminent adoption had led the pro-patent forces to ask for rejection.  In fact no voice from the European Parliament is quoted.

The text also restates that the Commission will not submit a new directive on this subject, an attitude that has met [:PressConf050706En: sharp criticism from the president of the European Parliament, Joseph Borell and the rapporteur Michel Rocard].

After having read the press release, FFII board member Jonas Maebe wrote 
a letter to OSAIA's Will Rodgers, whom FFII knows from cooperation in a recent [:Konf0506En: conference]:

  Hi Will,

  Congratulations for leading and winning the battle against software  
  patents in Europe:
     http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/headlines/news/article_05_07_20_en.html

  "Critics of the CII patent law --- led by the Open Source and Industry  
  Alliance (OSAIA) --- claim copyright law already adequately protects  
  software inventions and that patenting would just raise the cost of  
  innovating."

  That's an article by the European Commission, you just can't believe  
  how they keep trying to spin it, even after they've lost. At least  
  they talk fairly consistently about software patents (and not about  
  "CII's") in that article.

  And of course our friend Mark MacGann gets to fill half the article  
  with his opinions as well. Is this really what our public money is  
  spent on?
