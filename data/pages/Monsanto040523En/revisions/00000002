= Monsanto Wins Case Over Patented Canola =

The Supreme Court of Canada(1) says that you're liable if a plant with a 
patented gene infects your property. If you recall, Schmeiser(2) claims (and 
research(3) supports) that Roundup Ready canola seeds infected his own crops. 
Monsanto prosecuted him for patent infringement. Some other links:
