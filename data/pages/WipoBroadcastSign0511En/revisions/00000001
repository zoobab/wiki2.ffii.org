I (Laura Creighton) think we should sign.  The creators of media
works need protection from the distributors, again.
 
This is from the posting.


 > Background:
 >
 > What is at stake? The proposed treaty for the protection of
 > broadcasting organizations being negotiated at WIPO will create a
 > new intellectual property right. Broadcasters, cablecasters and
 > webcasters or organizations that make broadcast or <93>beam<94> audio
 > visual works and make them available to the public will be
 > granted a 50 year exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the
 > copying, fixation or redistribution of such works, among other
 > rights. These new rights, called <93>related rights<94> in Europe, will
 > be an additional layer of rights on top of copyright owners<92>
 > existing rights. When the broadcast, cablecast or webcast
 > includes non-copyrighted works (either in the public domain or
 > not copyrightable like facts), the transmitter, i.e. the
 > broadcasting, cablecasting or webcasting organizations will be
 > granted exclusive rights to control the works they transmit.
 > Although, this is presented as a simple update of the Rome
 > Convention (which the US never signed), it goes beyond what is
 > required in the TRIPS[i]. Furthermore, by adding webcasting
 > organizations to the list of beneficiaries, the treaty drafters
 > are creating a new intellectual property rights regime for the
 > Internet.
 >
 > Presented as an anti-piracy treaty to protect a signal[ii], the
 > treaty will in fact give intermediaries more power and control
 > over creators (copyright owners and performers) and the public.
 > Furthermore, by adding webcasting organizations as a new
 > beneficiary of intellectual property rights, the treaty will
 > change how the Internet functions and its use. It will add to the
 > already existing thicket of rights for audiovisual work and
 > multimedia works that create obstacles for creators, distributors
 > and the public. Like new tollbooths on the Internet, the new
 > rights will slow down traffic and prevent the dissemination of
 > information and various works.
 >
 > The discussions on this controversial treaty have been going on
 > since 1998 but the WIPO secretariat, with the help of the US
 > delegation, is now putting pressure on members states to agree to
 > a diplomatic conference by 2006. We have been asking the US
 > delegation to answer the following questions:
 >
 > Has there been any analysis of how US law would have to change if
 > the treaty is passed?
 > Has there been any analysis or concern about how this new
 > intellectual property right would impact copyright owners?
 > Has there been any analysis of the unintended consequences of
 > creating a new right of transmission that does not exist in any
 > country for the Internet?
 > Has there been any analysis on how the new intellectual property
 > right would affect the orphan works problems?
 > Has there been any analysis of the impact of the webcasting
 > provisions on podcasting and on peer-to-peer networks?
 >
 > The US delegation headed by Mike Keplinger of the USPTO and Jule
 > Sigall of the Copyright Office have confirmed that there has been
 > no analysis or attempt to answer these questions. There has been
 > no public consultation on this controversial treaty and we are
 > now asking for a federal register notice before a final draft is
 > negotiated at WIPO in Geneva. By that time, it will be difficult
 > to change the broad scope and the language of the treaty. We
 > believe that the public, copyright owners and performers, small
 > webcasters and others would have much to say about this proposed
 > treaty if given the opportunity to comment.

 > [i] In Article 14 of the TRIPS Agreement: broadcasters "shall
 > have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken
 > without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of
 > fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of
 > broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of
 > television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant
 > such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide
 > owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the
 > possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the
 > provisions of the Berne Convention (1971)."
 >
 > [ii] broadcasting organizations are already protected all over
 > the world if not under a related rights regime under other
 > regulatory regimes. In the US broadcasting organizations
 > protection is under the communications law which provides a
 > direct right for broadcasters to control the use and
 > dissemination of their signals (Section 325 of the Comm. Act from
 > 1934, as amended, 47 USC Section 325). The provision was
 > originally enacted as part of the Radio Act of 1927, prohibiting
 > the rebroadcasting of a station's signal without the originating
 > station's consent. It has since been expanded to cover the new
 > cable and satellite retransmission technologies developed later
 > in the 20th century. There are also separate civil and criminal
 > provisions prohibiting the unauthorized interception and
 > disclosure of certain wire, radio, and electronic communications
 > (see section 605 and 18 USC sections 2510-2512). Beyond these
 > direct statutory rights important additional sources of legal
 > protection under IP law can be used by broadcasters against
 > unauthorized use of a broadcaster's signal such as trademark
 > laws, the Lanham Act, and state competition laws, as well as the
 > Copyright law.
