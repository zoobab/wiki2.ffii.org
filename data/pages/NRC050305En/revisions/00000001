''The NRC Handelsblad is one of the most influential Dutch newspapers. On Saturday 5 March 2005, they published an article on software patents quoting Jan Lohstroh (vice president patent department of Philips), Arend Lammertink (Vrijschrift/FFII NL) and Reinier Bakels (lawyer and law scholar). Additionally, they also published an editorial on the way the software patents directive is being treated by the legislative branches of the EU. Below, you can find an English translation of some quotes from the editorial. To read the full text (in Dutch), you have to be a paying subscriber.''

 It would be commendable if the European Commission would care more
 about the European citizens than about her own institutional rights.
 In the light of the referenda regarding the European constitution, it
 is curious that the European Commission stubbornly holds on to a draft
 directive which has been opposed by among others the German, Spanish
 and Dutch parliaments. Nonetheless, the Commission has rejected a
 request from the European Parliament to draft a new directive. In
 Brussels, an institutional power play is unfolding, which no longer can
 be understood by the concerned parties and which has nothing to do
 anymore with the case itself. 
 
 [...]
 
 For large companies such as IBM, Microsoft or Philips, that is no
 problem. They have a mutual balance of power in terms of claims and
 lawyers, allowing them to neutralise each other's patents among
 themselves. But for small and medium-sized software developers, an
 overly broadly formulated directive can be fatal. The assurance from
 the Commission that trivial patents can be opposed is not reassuring.
 Opposition means employing expensive lawyers against companies which
 have plenty of money for juridical procedures. All parties agree that
 Europe may not 'juridify' as much as is done in America.
 
 The European Parliament only wants to allow patents on software which
 "controls the forces of nature". This excluded buying using a credit
 card and the electronic shopping cart. The European Commission and the
 European Council of Ministers have, advised by multinational
 corporations, scrapped the clear definition of the European Parliament
 and accepted a new, more vague proposal.
 
 [...]
 
 The Commission proposal is undesirable, because it does not clearly
 define what a software patent is and consequently leads to hollow
 claims and expensive juridical procedures. Last Thursday the Tweede
 Kamer (House  of Commons, ed) unanimously adopted a motion requesting
 the Cabinet to reject the directive. Next Monday, the Underminister
 for Economic Affairs will have the opportunity to do so in the
 European Competitiveness Council in Brussels. The Commission must be
 induced to take into account the European Parliament, at least three
 national parliaments and the interests of small and medium-sized
 enterprises. Many studies, among which one from Deutsche Bank,
 conclude that software-'juridification' hampers innovation. A new
 directive is better than yet another round of amendments for a bad
 directive during deliberations among three European bodies. The
 Commission, which is not democratically elected, ought to respect the
 parliament.
