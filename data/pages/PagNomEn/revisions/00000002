----
 * Base + ![Year![Month![Day]]] + Language 2 digit ISO 639
 * Language is a must element for every kwiki page
 * date is a must element for every kwiki page that is related to news, events or temporary projects


== Examples ==

 * HeiseZypries040528De
 * Cons040507En
 * SwpDemo0405En
 * SwpatcninoEn

== Rules ==


 * [[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html|Country codes ISO 31166]]
 * [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm|2 digit language codes ISO 639]]


   * those kwiki pages that do not have a time element are likely to be collections 
 * Base may sometimes contain significant subparts, such as 'Ltr' for 'letter'
 * Base can be an array of semantic elements
   * examples
     * KwikiEn --> KwikiPrivatEn --> KwikiPrivatHelpEn
     * SwpatcninoEn, SwpatcninoMetaEn, Swpatcnino04En, Swpatcnino0406En
     * LtrCons0406En --> LtrConsRecv0406En --> LtrConsRecvFr0406Fr
**** in the last example the first 'Fr' stands for a country, the last for a language
**** in all examples the date+language part always stays at the end
   * any base that consists of more than one element is considered to be an array of semantic elements where the individual elements can be swapped against others by certain language-independent rules.  News items are normally one-dimensional, i.e. consist of a single-element stem (+ date + language)
   * please do not use english or other native language grammar within a wiki name, always use arrays of isolated semantic elements
 * Considering that ultimately these wiki pages may be correlated to multilingual arrays of static pages, it is desirable to use base names that are independent of the idiosyncrasies of one language, such as English.  Names or latin/esperanto/interlingua stems are desirable (e.g. prefer 'invit' over 'invitation').  Stems should be perfectly readable in Italian, Polish or Indonesian, i.e. consist of basic vowels a e i o u and basic consonants.  If you want to use the english word "feature", write "fiitshar"
   * Some [[LojbanEn| Lojban]] root words are used in page names such as SwpatcninoEn, SwpatpenmiEn, SwpatxatraEn etc.  Lojban word formation is extremely logical, well-documented and language-neutral but also involves a steeper learning curve and may therefore be less advisable than combinations of names and latin stems.
