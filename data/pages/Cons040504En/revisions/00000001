== Current Developments ==

In secret negotiations, whose minutes are inaccessible to any elected legislator, be it in the European Parliament or in national parliaments, patent officials from the European Commission and national patent administrations (patent offices) are pushing to align the Commission and Council on the collection of the most extreme patent-fetishist positions, including direct claimability of computer programs and process descriptions and unfettered enforcement of patents against communication standards.

In a meeting of 2004/04/28 within the Commission it seemed that DG Infosoc (Liikanen) has given up resistance against program claims, thus relinquishing its only achievement from the negotiations of 2001. If DG Infosoc upheld its resistance and gained allies within the European Commission (which is not difficult in the current climate), the decision would have to be reached by  unanimity.  This would probably mean postponement to the next presidency, which may not be as submissive to corporate lobbies as the Irish one.

At a meeting of 2004/05/03 in the European Patent Office, Gert Kolle, chief diplomat of the EPO, explained that he expected a decision on wednesday 2004-05-05.  Indeed other sources are also expected at another coreper meeting tomorrow, 2004-05-05.  However similar expectations had proven wrong at some previous occasions (starting from the Base Proposal of 2000/06, which the EPO also assumed would pass without problems).

If a decision is taken, the issue will be treated as an A-item, i.e. nodded off by the ministers without even a formal discussion on May 17/18.

The new member states still do not have a say.  
They will be allowed to participate in the voting only in november.
However Slovakia has already expressed opposition and some others are expected to do so too.
This is one reason for some people in Council and Commission to further rush the procedure.
