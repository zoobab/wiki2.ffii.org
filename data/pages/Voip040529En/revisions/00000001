Another article where a software company touts a patent on a great "technology" without giving the number, let alone main claim, of the concerned patent.

What is claimed is usually a calculation task, characterised by a certain input and a certain output.

We still need to research what is claimed in this case.

Given the track record of patent hype publications in online media, we can not even take the existence of the patent for granted.  See

 * [:Verum040526En: 2004-05-26 UK startup touts non-existent patent on "mathematical solution" for "software design methodology"]

for a recent example of false information uncritically spread on the same online medium. 

However, in this case there are indications that the patents do exist and Telchemy is in fact active in the field of Voice over IP.

For a search of related Telchemy patents, the [http://ep.espacenet.com/ EPO database] might be useful.

Internet Telephony is already heavily cluttered with patents, so that writing software in this field has become particularly difficult, see
