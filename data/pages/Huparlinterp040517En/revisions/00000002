= Hungarian Government promises Opposition to Software Patents =

Today Imre Mécs (liberal MP) made an interpellation in the Hungarian Parliament about software patents.
Dr. György Csepeli, State Secretary of the Informatics and Telecommunications Ministry, has said that
they are against software patents. He also stated that they want Hungarian programmers to be software
makers rather than serfs.

The Ministry of Prime Minister (which is another body within the Hungarian government with competence on
informatics) is known to hold the same position on the issue.
