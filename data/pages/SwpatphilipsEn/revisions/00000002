''Philips owns a large portfolio of broad and trivial patents on algorithms and functionalities, mostly in connection with sound and image processing.  Philips has been using this portfolio to charge levies on DVD players.  Patents seem to have become an important part of the otherwise often bulky and uncompetitive business of Philips.  The managment of Philips has allowed and encouraged its patent lawyers to lobby for software patents in Europe more aggressively than most other companies, openly using lies and blackmail against governments as their favorite tactic.  The Dutch government seems to be completely obedient to Philips.''

Here are some translated excerpts:

  Philips threatens to stop developing software in Europe if it does not
  become possible to obtain software patents.

  This weekend in the "Algemeen Dagblad", the electronics giant
  threatened to move its software development to America and Asia. "By
  obtaining patents, you are able to make money as developer of
  software, which then can be invested again in new software", thus Hans
  Streng, president of the board of Philips Software, in the "Algemeen
  Dagblad".

They already said they will migrate their research to Asia anyway in
other articles (without even mentioning software patents):

Philips's software patents are as stupid as all the other ones. I've
gone through some of their applications recently (with Gauss) and I
found applications for a speaking avatar (with random eye blinks) and
recognizing a company name in a speech stream. 

They are constantly complaining about Asian companies but in fact
those started lawsuits against Philips, because the latter's patent
fees on DVD players are about half of the price of a DVD player in a
shop.

Phlips isn't "better" or more honest in this whole discussion than
Nokia, IBM, Siemens. In fact they threatened to move production and
R&D outside the EU if they don't get what they are asking for. Publicly.
