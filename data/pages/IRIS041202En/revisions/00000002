== Presentation given at IP Summit ==

At [[http://www.ipsummit.info/|IP Summit 2004]], Pierre De Muelenaere (president and CEO of I.R.I.S.), gave the following presentation: [[http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/sme/IRIS-ipsummit.pdf|download]]. In this presentation, he explains what he thinks about the "computer-implemented inventions" directive and why an innovative company like I.R.I.S. prefers no software patents.

== Summary ==

 * I.R.I.S. was founded in 1987, has a revenue of 43 million euro, employs 250 people
 * High R&D investments: 9% of revenue, 70 high-level scientists and software developers
 * Competes on the international market, main competition comes from US-based companies

 * Strategy to protect IP: copyright
 * Advantages over patents:
   * No requirement to disclose innovations
   * No patenting costs
   * As SME, I.R.I.S. does not have the resources to check for infringements and enforce the patents
 * Basic problem is piracy (basic) and not reverse engineering (sophisticated)

 * USA experience:
   * More than 10% of revenue comes from the USA
   * Many software patents are broad and trivial
   * I.R.I.S. has been involved in IP-litigation in the USA
   * Litigation costs are outside the reach of SMEs
   * Lots of patent abuse (by large companies and specialised "IP-firms")
   * Growing concern in the USA itself about patent system

 * European software patents? Many open questions.

 * Conclusion:

   * Invests a lot in R&D
   * Doesn't want to be copied, is strongly against piracy
   * In favor of strong copyright enforcement
