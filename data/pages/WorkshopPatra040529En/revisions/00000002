= Workshop in Patra, Greece, 29-30 May 2004. =

We are happy to announce that the Greek activist team for software patents is organizing an anti-software-patents workshop in Patras on 29 and 30 May.

During the last two months the Greek activist team has been reorganizing. The number of active people doing continuous work has increased from 1 to at least 5 people. This, to a large degree, was triggered by the events of April and May.

Until now we have contacted numerous key people concerning software patents, made many translations, setup a wiki, assembled a to-do list, prepared lists of candidate !MEPs and other important Greek persons and directly helped FFII with several contributions. The increased and persistent activity has brought even more people to the team.

On 29 and 30 May 2004, a nationwide workshop will be held in Patras. At least five people from different cities are expected to be there spending the weekend exclusively on their common purpose. At least 3 more will not be able to attend the workshop physically and will participate through IRC. Discussion highlights are expected to be, among others, creation of a roadmap, organization of some nationwide events, discussion for a more focused effort, political and press relations, improvement of the Greek web site and closer co-ordination with FFII.

Because of our geographical location, we don't expect any people from
other countries to participate; however, anyone happening to be passing
by is, of course, welcome and encouraged to contact us at
epatents at lists.hellug.gr.
