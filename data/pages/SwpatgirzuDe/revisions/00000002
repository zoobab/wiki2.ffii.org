I don't think we have to mention names here anymore as the network is so huge.

swpatag is outdated, hmm?

Bernhard Reiter 20040115:
 Please add a statement where problems in the swpat.ffii.org
 webpages should be reported to. Bigger comments might go into the
 wikis, if people knew that. Technical comments should go somewhere else
 most people will not expect a wiki to be regularily checked by the webmasters.
