== Commentary  ==

Public private partnerships against crime and terrorism at the EU level implies a privatization of the police. We already see this in the IPRED 2 directive (framework art 4, see also the explanatory memorandum on this article), where rightholders of "intellectual property" rights like copyright and patents can assist the police, even in drawing conclusions. What about neutrality of police investigation? What about possible abuse?

And then, dataretention was meant for fighting terrorism. Now the music and movie industries lobby to make the data available for tracking downloaders too. 

Add this together. Data meant for fighting terrorism can be used by music and movie industries, who can assist the police, and IPRED 2 sets drastic sentences on all "intellectual property" rights violations. Clouds over Europe.
