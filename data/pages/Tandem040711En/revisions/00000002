Sebastian Haunss (sebastian.haunss at uni-essen.de) is looking for
a postd-doctoral partner for research on the collective claims-making around the issue of EU policies in the area of software patents, to apply for the 
[[http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/foerderung/foerderinitiativen/merkblaetter/merkumwe_e.htm|"Tandem Program" of the Volkswagen Foundation]].
Applications must be submitted before 2004-08-31.

The aim of the research project would be to analyze the actions and frames of different political actors involved in the EU software patent directive project and the conflicts surrounding it.

The "Tandem Program" allows post-doctoral students to pursue a research project for a period of up to three years.

Partners should fullfil the following requirements:
 * optimally less than two years after having finished !PhD (it may be slightly more)
 * because Haunss has a background in political science, and it is an interdisciplinary program, partners should have a background in a different field (eg computer science, law, or economics).
 * residence in Europe, being able to communicate in English or German with Haunss

In case of interest, please contact Haunss directly (sebastian.haunss at uni-essen.de).
