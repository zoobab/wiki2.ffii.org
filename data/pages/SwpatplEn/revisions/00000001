''In Poland nobody except for the local subsidiary of Microsoft and the Patent Lawyer Association, favors software patents.  Major industry associations such as PRO.pl are against.  Even the Polish Patent Office has maintained its indepences from the European Patent Office practise and has strongly protested against the EU's attempts to impose the EPO practise on Europe.  Yet Poland has come under pressure from the EU Council to "vote" YES for an uncompromisingly pro-patent draft in the Council which it can not support.  Poland spectacularly resisted this pressure 3 times, while representatives in the European Parliament worked to have the proposal return to 1st reading.''
