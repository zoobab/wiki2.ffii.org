F. A. von Hayek, "'Free' Enterprise and Competitive Order". In
Individualism and Economic Order, Chicago: U. of Chicago Press.
1948. 113-114.

The problem of the prevention of monopoly and the prevention of
competition is raised much more acutely in certain other
fields to which the concept of property has been extended only in recent
times. I am thinking here of the extension of the
concept of property to such rights and privileges as patents for
inventions, copyright, trade-marks, and the like. It seems to me beyond
doubt that in these fields a slavish application of the concept of
property as it has been developed for material things has done a great
deal to foster the growth of monopoly and that here drastic reforms may
be required if competition is to be made to work.[..]
Patents, in particular, are specially interesting from our point of view
because they provide so clear an illustration of how it is necessary in
all such instances not to apply a ready-made formula but to go back to
the rationale of the market system and to decide for each class what the
precise rights are to be which the government ought to protect.
This is a task at least as much for economists as for lawyers. Perhaps
it is not a waste of your time if I illustrate what I have in mind by
quoting a rather well-known decision in which an American judge argued
that 'as to the suggestion that competitors were excluded from the use
of the patent we answer that such exclusion may be said to have been the
very essence of the right conferred by the patent' and adds 'as it is
the privilege of any owner of property to use it or not to use it
without any question of motive'. It is this last statement which seems
to me to be significant for the way in which a mechanical extension of
the property concept by lawyers has done so much to create undesirable
and harmful privilege.
