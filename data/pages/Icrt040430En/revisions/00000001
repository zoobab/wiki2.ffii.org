The letter of a well-known pro-patent group dominated by large telecommunication companies
spreads misinformation about the European Parliament's amendments to the software patent directive
and asks the Council to remove all the limits that the Parliament imposed.

This letter presents the often-used [http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trips/ Trips lie] as well as other patent movement propaganda whose untruth everybody knows, and puts under it the impressive names of some big companies.  

Among the companies that supported this letter are major media and publishing companies such as Bertelsmann, Reuters, Reed Elsevier, Walt Disney, Yahoo, Time Warner etc.

The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that ICRT has its own patent workgroup in which the patent arms of the interested companies assemble and draft statements that the group signs without discussing much about them.

 I am writing this letter on behalf of the ICRT member companies to
 draw your attention to the fact that what European businesses need is
 legal certainty. As expressed in Recital 7b, the aim of this Directive
 is to prevent different interpretations of the provisions of the
 European Patent Convention (EPC) concerning the limits to
 patentability. The consequent legal certainty should help to foster a
 climate conducive to investment and innovation in the field of
 software. As acknowledged in Recital 6, the Community and its Member
 States are bound by the Agreement on trade-related aspects of
 intellectual property rights (TRIPS). Article 27(1) of TRIPS provides
 that patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products
 or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new,
 involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application.

 Moreover, according to TRIPS, patent rights should be available and
 patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of
 technology. These principles should accordingly apply to
 computer-implemented inventions.

 As we have submitted earlier, the European Parliament?s version of
 the Directive, if adopted, would lead to a business climate that
 discourages investment in and development of technology. The current
 legal regime, although imperfect, is unquestionably superior to that
 which would be introduced by the European Parliament?s version of the
 Directive.  We urge the Council not to agree on a bad compromise, but
 only to consider the interest of having a dynamic European market and
 research-based companies in all fields of industry where the
 development of software ensures innovation and new growth.

 We are confident that the Council will show the right way and will
 take into consideration the long-term concerns of competitiveness and
 employment in Europe. We therefore urge you to reject proposals of the
 kind expressed in footnotes 12 and 15 of your April 22 draft and to
 consider improving article 5 paragraph 2 in a way that would truly
 reflect existing EPO practice. Adopting a bad compromise that deviates
 from TRIPS and that deviates from the EPC as consistently interpreted
 by the European Patent Office's Boards of Appeal will turn out to be
 far worse than keeping the current legal regime, without a directive
 on computer-implemented inventions.  Yours sincerely,

 John Stephens
