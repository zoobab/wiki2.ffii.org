''Warsaw, 4 March 2005 -- The Polish minister for science and informatisation Michael Kleiber says that Poland will support a request for a B-item (discussion) on software patents at the Council meeting on Monday 7 March if anyone asks for one, but they will not take the initiative. His main message is: Poland cannot fight alone.''

It is clear that the current proposal no longer has the support of Poland -  if it ever had. This means that there is no qualified majority anymore, and that pushing the current Council text through would be in violation of the Council's own rules of procedure. After all, a qualified majority must exist when the Common Position is adopted. Their political agreement has no legal value whatsoever, no matter what the [[http://k.lenz.name/LB/archives/000994.html|"unwritten rules"]] say.

Nevertheless, Poland clearly invites other governments, such as the [[Zypries041221En| German]] and [[Adelskov050224En| Danish]] one, to take the lead. If no one takes the initiative to ask for a new vote, the silence will be interpreted as consent to the votes as recorded on 18 May 2004 and thus the Common Position will be adopted.

One often heard argument against reopening discussions, is that this would make any political agreement reached in the future worthless. The reasoning is that any country could always reopen discussions afterwards.  E.g. "European Voice" carried a long article last week that made this argument and accused Poland of disrupting the EU's procedures.  

However the argument does not hold water.

Rule 3.8 of the [[http://ue.eu.int/uedocs/cms_data/docs/2004/6/21/Councils%20rules%20of%20procedure.pdf|Council's Rules of Procedure]] clearly states that any country can reopen the discussions, ''unless the Council decides otherwise''.

This means that the Council, if backed by a majority of member states, can decline a request for renewed discussions.

[[HartmutPilchEn| Hartmut Pilch]], president of FFII, explains:

  There is a simple way for Council legislators to prevent late B-item 
  requests from occurring: Consult with national parliaments '''before''' you 
  conclude a political agreement! Do what the new EU Constitution (Art I-46) and
  many older documents say you should do! A late B-item request is only a 
  safety valve against abuses of the Council process.  In fact it is
  a weak safety valve that will work only in case of very severe abuse.

  Renegotiating the software patent agreement does not mean renegotiating
  every agreement. Contrary to what the patent lobby and some Council diplomats
  imply, it is not true that every agreement of the Council is based on 
  deception and misrepresentation of national Parliaments.  Europe
  is not a banana republic whose supreme legislators need to fear 
  even the weakest checks and balances.
  
Jonas Maebe, FFII board member, concludes:

 "There no longer is any excuse not to reopen discussions. Even in
  the European Parliament, both opponents and proponents of software
  patents are in favour of interrupting the current procedure. The
  former because they don't like the current Council text, the latter
  because they are afraid the Commission's restart refusal will only
  strengthen the opposition.

  I am really wondering who or what is the actual driving force behind
  the current collision course of both the Council and the Commission."
