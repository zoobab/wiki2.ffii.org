  WRITTEN QUESTION E-3502/06
  by David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    EPLA
  
  The aim of the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement) is to harmonise
  the diverging interpretation of the EPC in all states that would sign the
  agreement.
  
  This is essentially the same goal as the software patent directive which
  was rejected last year by the European Parliament with near unanimity.
  
  Does the European Commission agree with the above?
