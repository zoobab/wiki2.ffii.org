''On 7th March 2005 the Council of the EU claimed to have adopted a "Common Position" on the software patents directive.  However this was only a minority position of the most pro-patent forces, and it is unclear whether and how it was adopted.  Specific questions asked by FFII have been left unanswered.  We need to obtain further expertise and clarification.  Given the nefarious precedent which it creates, March 7th should be worthy for commemoration as "Banana Union Day".''

== Things to be done ==

 * ask member states to challenge decision before European Court of Justice (difficult, most likely candidates: DK, NL, PL, PT)
 * obtain answer from Council, obtain support from parliamentarians and others for answer request
 * obtain support of national parliamentarians and COSAC for reforms that bring the Council under control
 * obtain legal expertise from EU law scholars
 * push the subject into the French and other Constitution referendum campaigns
 * improve documentation/visualisation, prepare European Banana Union Day commemorations
 * contact possible allies
