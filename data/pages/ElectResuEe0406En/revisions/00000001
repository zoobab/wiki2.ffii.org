The situation with 6 Estonian seats is as follows (EP parliamentary groups in parentheses):

 * [http://www.sotsdem.ee Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond] 3 (PSE) and [http://www.isamaaliit.ee Isamaliit] 1 (EPP-ED) -- both have repeatedly shown their will to stand against software patents, ESD's standard response is also to suggest reading Larry Lessig's [http://www.free-culture.cc Free Culture] and Isamaliit even slightly used software patentability issue during last weeks to gain press visibility

 * [http://www.reform.ee Reformierakond] 1 (ELDR) -- minister Meelist Atonen chose to believe that "irish compromise" is already protecting us from software patents when he represented Estonia on 18.05.2004 meeting.

 * [http://www.keskerakond.ee Keskerakond] 1 (ELDR) -- despite repeated requests has failed to define their position

There is an ongoing process to help Reformierakond understand the difference between current draft and the amendments made by EP.
