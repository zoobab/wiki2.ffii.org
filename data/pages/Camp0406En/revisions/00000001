Here's the standard letter that people are encouraged to edit:

 I am writing to say that it is important to me that Europe has strong 
 intellectual property laws in place and that they are enforced properly.

 The creative industries are under assault from pirates, counterfeiters

 creative industries to function.  17,000 jobs a year and billions of 
 Euros are lost every year because the IP laws are weak or not enforced.

 Please support us when you're elected.  We're counting on you!
