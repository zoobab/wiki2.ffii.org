Extract:
----
The EPO is not bound by many of the laws or regulations that most of the citizens of Europe take for granted, such as the European Convention on Human
Rights.

Some examples:

The Employment Law offers the staff extremely limited protection. Staff can be dismissed almost at will by the
President and have no claims to unemployment pay or other social security payments:

Basic legal rights are ignored. The President is the ultimate ruler of the EPO. He is judge, jury and
executioner. His decisions on matters within the office are final. Any decision made by the President can be enacted
immediately. There is no "stay of execution" pending the outcome of appeal hearings. Sanctions are arbitrary and harsh.

Even criminal law is disregarded: In 1995 the then President of the EPO physically attacked and injured a staff member,
the Administrative Council of the EPO subsequently refusing to lift the immunity of the President.

   * The claim must be examined as a whole ("claim as a whole")
   * The invention as claimed has technical character if it produces a technical effect
   * The technical effect need not be new
   * The technical character is evident if the claimed subject matter relates to the control of physical processes, physical entities or devices
   * The technical character of an invention is not affected by its use in a non-technical field
   * The technical character is evident if the claims relate to an apparatus (device, system, etc)
   * The technical character of a computer-implemented invention is demonstrated if the claimed subject-matter exhibits a 'further technical effect' which goes beyond the normal interaction between a computer program and the computer hardware.
   * The test for the further technical effect is '''separate''' from the test novelty or inventive activity.
   * The further technical effect can be demonstrated by the use of technical considerations.
   * The further technical effect can be assumed for a claim which recites technical elements (e.g. computers).
'''Examples of technical contributions to the "claim as a whole" by elements which "as such" are non-technical could be: 
   ''' A mathematical algorithm used to improve the operating characteristics of a known device or method - the combination of device and algorithm operates in a technically different way
   * A computer comprising a new arrangement of data or processing steps to increase the operating speed or reduce the required computer resources for automatic processing
   * A business method implemented on a computer to provide a new functionality of the computer system
