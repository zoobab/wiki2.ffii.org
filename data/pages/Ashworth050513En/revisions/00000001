''UK Conservative MEP Ashworth and others are trying to soothe concerned citizens by telling them some standard untruths, such as that the Council's proposal doesn't legalise software patents, which it interprets to refer to (fictitious and pointless) patents on "computer code".  Ashworth is probably forwarding a text from Malcolm Harbour.''

== Remarks ==

Below we cite the salient passages of the text while inserting a few short remarks, mostly refutations, here and there.  It might be worthwhile to write an [:SwpatdanfuEn: "Myths and Facts" style FAQ] on pieces from this text.

== Ashworth Response ==

[...]

  The Council Presidency has now formally adopted the Common position,
  which it was entitled to do under its rules of procedure. These rules
  are the responsibility of the Member States Governments, not the
  European Parliament.

The Council is not entitled to adopt a position when members demand renegotiations, as was the case at the [:Cons050307En: session in question].

  The full co-decision process is being observed, in which Parliament
  has full rights to amend the proposal at both first and second
  reading. MEP's have been closely involved in the scrutiny of this
  proposal, and we can assure you that there has been no lack of public
  discussion, as you imply in your letter.

True, as far as the Parliament is concerned.  Not true for the Council.

The UK Conservatives (Mr. Harbour) have been been helping the Council
(i.e. ministerial patent officials) get away without serious
discussion.  The following text demonstrates this once more.

  In judging any future amendments, it is essential to have a full
  understanding of the objectives of this proposal. It is intended to
  clarify existing patent law so that software is specifically excluded,
  whereas genuine inventions which may include digital technology
  (estimated to be around 60 - 70% of all patent applications) are
  allowed. There is absolutely no intention to apply patent law to
  "computer code" - this would, in any case, be impossible to achieve
  since patents cover technical concepts, not specific coded solutions.

Indeed "patenting computer code" is a fictitious and pointless exercise, never asked for by anyone, just constructed in order to pretend that software patents are not being granted and [:Epue52En: Art 52 EPC] is not being violated.

  We will now be evaluating the adopted text to see whether it achieves
  the desired objectives; to provide patent inspectors with a common
  framework within which to examine, and if appropriate, grant patents
  for innovations involving digital technology. We must ensure that
  computer software or business methods that do not involve new
  innovative concepts or make a technical contribution are excluded from
  patents. This will give the EU a distinctive and different position
  from the US and Japan.

There is no difference in the position of EU, US and Japan, as far as these
points are concerned. See the [:SwpatuseujpEn: Trilateral Standards] for
more on this subject.

  We need to consider the potential effect of the Directive on software
  development. You indicated in your letter that this would have a
  disastrous effect on innovation and even affect open source
  software. We would be glad to have your evidence of this. 

Evidence has been collected at 
 * [:SwpikxraniEn: Patents in Action]

  We have consulted open source experts and there appears to be
  nothing in this Directive that will affect the expansion of open source
  solutions. 

We'd be interested to hear who these "open source experts" are.

  There is little evidence from the USA that software
  development has been slowed down by the US patent regime. 

See above page.  If that is not "evidence", what would be?
What evidence is there for beneficiality of patents, for software
and elsewhere?  Economists usually answer that there is none, except
perhaps in very few domains, such as chemistry and pharma.

  If the EU Directive is passed, it will be more restrictive than the 
  current US patent environment. There is also little sign from the USA, of large
  companies pursuing small companies for patent enforcement -evidence
  suggests that the opposite is the case. 

Active pursuing in court is not needed, showing the torture
instruments is enough.  And there is abundant evidence anyway (see above).

  Also, patent specialists consider that the passing of the EU Directive 
  will exclude the attempted enforcement of existing US patents across 
  the EU. We may need to tighten up the proposal to ensure that this happens.

Enforcement of US patents is not an issue.

What matters is whether European software patents which typically have exactly the same claims as their US cousins are enforcable.

  We are also especially concerned to protect innovative companies,
  especially small firms, using digital technology to produce genuinely
  original technical solutions. We have been contacted by many of them
  and they are very concerned that they may be excluded form the patent
  regime by inappropriate amendments to the EU proposal. 

On who these "concerned SMEs" might be, see 
[:EictaSme0504En: EICTA sends Microsoft to the EP as an SME].

  Patent royalty income is very important to these companies and is a major 
  incentive to innovative research. If their needs are not taken into account, 
  the impact on innovation could certainly be "disastrous".

Closer research shows that this is hardly the case.  For a case study of an UK SME
that has been touted as matching the above description, see [http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/allvoice/ Allvoice].

  In the end, the Parliament must balance all the arguments and reach a
  sensible solution that is right for everyone involved in the European
  economy. Conservative MEPs will be, as has been the case throughout,
  very much involved.

This is true for [:SwpatmharbourEn: Malcolm Harbour].  If other conservative !MEPs had also been involved, things might look a little better.
