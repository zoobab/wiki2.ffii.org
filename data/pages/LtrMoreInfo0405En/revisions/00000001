Letter to a person that already knew about the issue but had asked for more background
material.

 Hello Mr xxx,

 Mr yyy has asked me to send you a pointer to
 the Italian minister's letter. Because that was
 yesterday, some of the links below may be redundant,
 but at least in addition the letter I also
 can point you to an article that appeared today in
 La Repubblica too.
