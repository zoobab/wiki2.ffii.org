                            Brussels, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Ljubljana
                            3rd July 2006

        Open Letter on the "Task Force to foster the competitiveness of
        Europe's ICT industry"

        Dear Commissioner Verheugen,
        Dear Commissioner Reding,

        On 6 June 2006 the Commission launched an ICT Task Force in order to
        foster the competitiveness of Europe's IT industry [1]. The Commission
        chose a group of representatives of the European IT/ICT industry to
        make IT policy recommendations. With some notable exceptions, these
        representatives are mostly very large firms.

        Given that IT is such a vital part of our modern information economy,
        and one of the drivers for European competitiveness, we would like to
        thank the Commission for its initiative in creating this forum.

        However, we feel obliged to remind the Commission that 80% of the
        information economy consists of SMEs[2], who thus generate the
        majority of jobs and taxes in this sector. Without a healthy SME
        sector, European IT will suffer and the European economy will lose
        competitiveness, jobs, and overall prosperity.

        We assume that the Commission's goals are to generate useful
        discussion of its IT policies, rather than start a friendly but
        unrepresentative talking club. Therefore we formally request the
        Commission to complete the missing 80% of its work by ensuring that
        this Task Force adequately represents the bulk of the IT industry,
        namely the SMEs.

        We understand that it is easier to group together a few large firms,
        than to group the hundreds of thousands of SMEs which form the mass of
        the European information economy. However we propose that the
        Commission work together with our organisations to bring this silent
        majority into the process.

        With a true economic majority, the Commission's proposals will be
        treated with much more weight, and are more likely to be economically
        accurate, reflecting the desire of the broader market for open
        standards, fair competition, and proportional ownership.

        We hope that the Commission will seriously consider our proposal, and
        modify the current project to truly represent the European IT sector.

        Yours sincerely,

        The signatories,

        Pieter Hintjens, President of FFII
        David Ramsden, Chairman of PCG UK
        Mario Ohoven, President of CEA-PME
        Marco Schulze, Spokesman of PatentFrei.de
        Slawomir Kosz, President of the Polish Software Market Association
        Andrej Mertelj, President of the Slovene Software Developers Assocation
