[[BentHindrupAndersenEn| Bent Hindrup Andersen]] (MEP, DK, [[EDDEn| EDD]]) received an answer to his
previous [[http://www.hindrup.dk/199.0.html|inquiry]] to Commissioner of
Competition Mario Monti on software patents.

Hindrup Andersen comments on Monti's reply as follows:

  Apparently, Monti agrees in my criticism and the importance of open
  standards, fair competition and protection of interoperability. But
  it seems as if the Commissioner wants it both ways. He wants to
  ensure the free competition, open standards and free software and at
  the same time he supports his colleagues in pushing for software patents
  within the EU and making them rigidly enforcable againts file formats and
  protocols.  Software patents block the interoperabillity that we all
  really want.

  If Commissioner Monti gets what he is calling for, I am afraid that we 
  will witness lots of new Microsoft cases in the future.
