A CEO of a small software company in Cyprus writes: 

I have recently been
contacted by a large American company that is trying to threaten me into
paying for a license for their "invention" or else they will go after my
customers. The worst part is that my product, a virtual keyboard, does not
even violate their patent, but because my program is programmable through
scripting it is possible to create a virtual keyboard that does something
similar to what is described in the patent.

The "invention" in question is the ability to change the label of a virtual
key from lower case to upper case when the shift key is pressed. All they
want for a license is a mere 116% of our annual turnover for the product in
question as a one-time fee, plus 5% of all sales indefinently.

The "invention" they claim to have made is to change the caption on a key
on a virtual keyboard from lower case to upper case when the shift key is
pressed. I have written and I sell a virtual keyboard program and also a
program to design virtual keyboards according to your own needs. My
products do not include the "invention" claimed in the patent, but I allow
VB scripts to be written in the keyboards so it is possible to create a
keyboard using my product that will perform such a function.

The original US patent was filed on May 13th 1986 and issued on February
16th 1988.  It has been reissiued the name of NCR with a date of
February 10th 2004.  This does not prolong the patent's lifetime, it means
just that the patent owner changed.
