Unilateral statement of Latvia regarding the directive on the patentability of computer  implemented inventions

At the Competitiveness Council of May 17  18, 2004 Latvia supported the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as Latvia considers the directive of high importance and agrees to the aims proposed in the directive.   

Latvia supports that legislation on the patenting of computer-implemented inventions should be harmonized at the level of European Union and there should be clarity which computer implemented inventions are patentable and which are not. 

In this light, Latvia wishes to confirm explicitly that the directive text now under consideration aims to exclude non-technical, non-inventive inventions, business methods and software from patentability. This is because patenting of this nature will not make a positive contribution to the ability to innovate. The directive should ensure that already issued patents would not affect the software users or producers by ensuring rights of publication and interoperability, as well as ensure compliance with all international treaties.

Further discussions on the directive in Latvia showed that the directive could largely influence the small and medium-size enterprises, which work in the field of information technology industry, as well as the development of the whole domestic industry. The industrial circles express their concerns that present text still contains some uncertainties.

Taking into account the above-mentioned reasons, Latvia in future will be able to agree with the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, which keeps the balance between patentability and non-patentability of computer implemented inventions.
