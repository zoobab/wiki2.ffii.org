  Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission

  The Commission made an announcement(1) regarding the composition of the
  Task-Force on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)  Competitiveness
  and ICT uptake in association with its first meeting, which took place on 6
  June 2006. The ICT Task-Force is one of several cross-sectoral and
  sector-specific initiatives, announced in the communication(2) on industrial
  policy adopted on 5 October 2005, that collectively aim to help improve the
  coherence between different policy dimensions, increase their relevance to
  individual sectors, and hence help create a more favourable business
  environment.
  
  As indicated by the Honourable Member, the specific mandate of the ICT
  Task-Force is to:
   	identify major obstacles to enhancing the ICT sector's competitiveness.
   	help mobilise the sector and draw the attention of Member States to the
  obstacles identified.
   	recommend possible policy responses.
  
  To this end, the Commission, following discussions with seven industry
  associations(3) and involving representative bodies from civil society, has
  recently issued invitations to a group of 25 stakeholders. (A list of these 25
  stakeholders is sent direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliaments
  Secretariat).
  
  With respect to the Honourable Member's first point regarding the exclusion of
  relevant European stakeholders, the Commission has established a reasonable
  balance between industry and civil society, industry sub-sectors, incumbents
  and new entrants, and big and medium/small players: 11 out of the 17 companies
  invited are European firms, of which 3 are small and medium-sized enterprises
  (SMEs), and all 17 are established in the EU. On the non-industry side, members
  represent trades unions, SMEs, chambers of commerce, consumers and investors,
  and include two academics active in the ICT competitiveness and general
  innovation fields. Furthermore, the work of the Task-Force will be taken
  forward by a number of working-groups whose composition is, as a matter of
  principle, open to further stakeholders.
  
  The Commission follows a policy of constructive engagement with all industry
  players active in the European ICT market. In response to the Honourable
  Member's specific questions:
  (i) 	As explained above, the composition of the ICT component of the
  Task-Force is a fair reflection of the diversity of the ICT sector and, on this
  basis, qualifies the ICT group, and the Task-Force as a whole, to fulfil its
  mandate.
  
  (ii) All the companies involved are significant players in the European ICT
  market and are stakeholders whose performance helps shape the competitiveness
  of the sector. That is why the Commission invited them to join the Task-Force.
