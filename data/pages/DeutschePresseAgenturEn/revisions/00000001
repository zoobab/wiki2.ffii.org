 * [:Neavis040713De: 2004-07-13 DPA spreads german business method patent david vs goliath story] -- based on an ungranted patent, with unverified claims about payments from !McDonald's food chain
 * Most of the [:ConsMedia040518De: german reporting about the Council decision 2004-05-18] was based on a report from DPA which gets quite a lot wrong and uncritically treats some of [:SwpatbolkesteinEn: Bolkestein]'s lies as truths.  Yet this report does not really justify dubbing DPA as "Deutsche Propaganda-Agentur".
