=== From Blasum's IRC summary (adapted): ===

- Background: FFII NL Arend Lammertink 

- Housing: Offer by Arend farmhouse (simple, but has net) in Twente, central NL, for Fr 17-Mo 20 Sept. The place is near http://www.koprensmorre.nl (adjacent building), Markelo, Twente, The Netherlands. It's good reachable by public transportation. If you take the train to "Holten", it's only about 10-15 minutes by bus, which stops within 200m of the place.

- Content: Discussions/Socializing: will happen anyway, education: lectures on legal texts and interpretations were suggesting, possibly also on how to use mlht or cps3 or other topics

- 'Scale': it was raised whether it would be better to have this more on a regional scale (reducing travel efforts) in several places (in that case the 17-20 Sept would be mainly for benelux,de), or more centrally. This was left open for further discussion. Another factor determining 'scale' was the availability of lectures and lecturers.
