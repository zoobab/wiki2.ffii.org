== Synopsis ==

According to news reports, the internet search engine Google may have to pay up to 290 millon dollar
to Yahoo for a patent on keyword-based advertisement.

An equivalent has been granted as a design patent by the German Patent Office,
against the letter and spirit of the written law
(but as with patents, the interpretation of the law is stretched like the german Ministry of justice [[Cons040518En| wants to do with the European Law by means of a directive]]).
