''3. März 2005 -- Der Kommissar für den Binnenmarkt wird zur Konferenz der Präsidenten in das Europäischen Parlament um 11:00 Uhr kommen um die Europäischen Kommission zu repräsentieren.''

The Presidents had invited Barroso, but Barroso had [[Barroso050302En| declined]].

On Monday Barroso had moreover [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/barroso0502/|declined the Parliament's restart request in writing without giving a reason]], but it is [[Com050228En| known]] that the main reason is the unwillingness of !McCreevy and the DG which he represents.

The EP's Legal Affairs Committee had already heard !McCreevy and voted 19:2 against his arguments.  The purpose of today's meeting had been to talk directly to Barroso, who is responsible for the rejection of the Parliament's request and who should have coordinated a collegiate decision involving all the directorates of the Commission, rather than just transmitted the wish of the leading Commissioner.
