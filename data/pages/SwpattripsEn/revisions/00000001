 * 2003-12-00 [http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/FT%20Submission%20on%20IP%20&%20Medicines%20091502.pdf Financial times article] Prof. Bhagwati strongly critizised the misuse of the WTO framework by the IPP Lobby: "IPP is not a 'trade' issue; and the WTO ought to be aboutlowering trade barriers and tackling market access problems that will often go beyond border measures to 'internal' regulations: a thorny issue. TRIPs is by contrast only about royalty collection. It was put into the WTO by considerable lobbying pressure in the United States in particular, so as to make the use of trade sanctions against user countries who used knowledge without paying royalty. It turned the WTO therefore into a royalty-collection agency!"

EU argued before WTO panel that Canada's practise was contrary to !TRIPs, pushed for narrow interpretation of exemption clauses, and won.
