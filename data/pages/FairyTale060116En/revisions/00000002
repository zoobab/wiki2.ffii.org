''The SW Patent Fairy Tale ~ by Cristian Miceli''

''Groklaw, the award-winning legal news and research website, has published an article by Cristian Miceli, a UK based IT lawyer, which takes a look at software patent issues in 2005 and addresses the question of whether software patents are beneficial or counterproductive.''

As an attorney, Miceli says he believes in intellectual property rights, and "as part of this, I see the benefits that patents can potentially bring in certain sectors. However, as one law professor recently commented, 'good policy does not just consist of "more rights"; it consists of maintaining a balance between the realm of property and the realm of the public domain'Â”.
