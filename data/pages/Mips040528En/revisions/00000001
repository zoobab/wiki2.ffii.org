"Lexra produces MIPS-compatible microprocessor cores but does not hold a license from MIPS. Lexra's main contention in its defense is that it uses software to emulate MIPS core functions without actually using the full MIPS instruction set. MIPS filed suit against Lexra in October 1999, claiming Lexra's design infringed upon its intellectual property."
