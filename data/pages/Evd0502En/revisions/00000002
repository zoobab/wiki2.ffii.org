''February 2005 -- China has adopted its homegrown version of the DVD standard in order to stay clear of patents that are making the DVD standard unattractive.  The EVD standard is also encumbered by patents, but these are mostly held by Chinese organisations and used according to rules imposed by the Chinese government.''
