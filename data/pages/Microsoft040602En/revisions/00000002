=== Hartmut Pilch (president of ffii): ===

This is not the kind of patent that we really need to be concerned about, because its main claims
can be refuted with prior art.  The real ''bad software patents'' are those that can not be weeded out with prior
art.  

By granting the "double click" the US patent office has delivered one more among hundreds of thousands of
examples which show that the patent examination system does not work for software.
10 years ago, patent offices 
and their supporters in the patent departments of IBM, AT&T etc claimed that software was just
a "new technology" like any other, and 
that "bad patents" would soon be a thing of the past, thanks to new prior art search tools.
But abstract ideas elude search tools, and software innovation is about abstraction.  You just need to read the main claim of this Microsoft patent to realize this.  It is a well
known problem now and was well known in 1994, when the USPTO held its hearings.  At that time, the big names of the US software
industry, except for Microsoft, all disapproved of the USPTO's plans to legalise software patents, but the
USPTO pressed ahead with its plans shortly after the hearing nonetheless.
