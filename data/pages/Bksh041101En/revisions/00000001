BSKH, a Brussels lobbying company, reports: "Industry insiders fear that this translation delay is masking a shift in member state positions".  The article also reiterates the mother of lies: that the EU Council is proposing only to allow patents on braking systems and the like but not on business software.

   Software Patents Directive threatened

   The Council of Ministers preliminary agreement to a draft Directive
   which would confirm the applicability of patents to computer-enabled
   inventions is threatening to fall apart. The proposal will clarify and
   harmonise national rules on patentability of these inventions which
   include products like automatic braking systems or high-definition
   television, and makes clear that straight business software is not
   patentable. Translations into all 20 community languages required to
   allow member states to finalise the agreement (reached in June) have
   been delayed and are now not expected before late November. But
   industry insiders fear that this technical delay is masking a shift in
   member state positions notably in Poland, Hungary, Germany and the
   Netherlands where intense lobbying from opponents representing small
   and medium-sized companies, the open source community and the European
   Parliament are pushing these countries to reconsider their agreement.
   If even one large EU member state withdraws support, the proposal will
   no longer benefit from the qualified majority support necessary for
   adoption.
