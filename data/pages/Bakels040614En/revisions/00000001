The following is a summary of a presentation delivered by [:ReinierBakelsEn: Reinier Bakels] to the
people in charge of patent policy at the dutch ministry of ecnomics in connection with the Parliament's recent
questioning of the ministry's behaviour on the software patent directive.

=== Specific ===

 * In the version of the Council, there is no definition of "technical", which completely undermines all limitations.
 * The problems with trivial patents lie outside the scope of this directive. The juridical condition that inventions only must "not be obvious to a person skilled in the art" remains applicable.
 * Business methods which are not implemented in computers also lie outside the scope of this directive. Americans strive towards no longer patenting "abstract business methods", but only "computer-implemented business methods". The directive proposal will obtain exactly the reverse: it rewards vague formulations of patent applications.
 * The concept of a "(technical) contribution" is in contradiction with the system of patent law en thus will lead to a lot of confusion.

=== More general ===
 * Misconceptions
   * "Patent law is ''the'' instrument of innovation policy."
   * "Intellectual Property is to the information society what the conventional property right was to the industrial society."
 * Reality
   * Patent law is derailing (see [http://www.ffii.org.uk/ftc/ftc.html FTC] and [http://www4.nationalacademies.org/news.nsf/isbn/0309089107?OpenDocument NAS] studies in the US): it has become a stifling lawyers' paradise.
   * The patent-incrowd calls the shots (because of lack of opposition)
   * The academic world has also been critical for a very long time in The Netherlands (Verkade, Spoor, Hugenholtz, Grosheide and other professors).
   * Wrong incentives: patent granting is profitable for the granting organisation (government/EPO), which is unique among licensing bodies.

=== Conclusion ===
 * Directive is tip of the iceberg.
 * Patent law is ripe for serious, systematic political attention.
 * It has everything to do with the "knowledge economy".
 * A chance for the Dutch Presidency?
