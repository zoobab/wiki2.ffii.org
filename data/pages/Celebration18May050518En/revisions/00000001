= 18th May: webdemo against software patents =
----

''Last 18th May, the Council of the 25 Ministers reached an agreement that would legalise software patents all over Europe. Since then, many voices condamned this vote. The European Parliament is now under heavy pressure from professional lobbyists of the big industry. They want to convince elected representatives of Europe that this law can be good for small and medium enterprises and Open Source software.''
