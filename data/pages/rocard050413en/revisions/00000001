''20 April 2005 -- The European Parliament's rapporteur Michel Rocard has published his views on the software patent directive and outlined the direction which his amendments will take.''

[:HartmutPilchEn: Hartmut Pilch] comments: 

 "Rocard's outline contains all the necessary ingredients for a
 directive that achieves what most member state governments say they
 want to achieve: to exclude computer programs from patentability
 while allowing computer-controlled technical inventions to be
 patented. Already in the title of his paper, Rocard proposes to
 replace the misleading term "computer-implemented inventions" by
 "computer-controlled inventions", and the report itself goes to the
 heart of the matter.

 Rocard explains the difference between applied natural science and
 data processing, and, from there solves the legislative problem in a
 consistent and adequate manner, delivering what programmers,
 economists and the vast majority of companies in software and related
 industries want to see.  It is unusual for an economist and former
 French prime minister to take up a fairly special,
 difficult-to-communicate problem with such seriousness and moral
 courage.

 Perhaps Rocard is showing here the same qualities that won him fame
 as the peacemaker of New Caledonia. In any case, the contrast with
 the evasiveness of the Council's patent bureaucrats could not be
 greater.  If the MEPs can vote for Michel Rocard's amendments in June
 and July, the Parliament will then, in the ensuing Conciliation
 procedure, be able to negotiate with the Council from a position of
 strength."

The full report with amendments is expected soon after the debate of 21st April.  The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) will vote on the report on 20th of June.  Around 6th of July the Parliament as a whole (plenary assembly) will vote on the results of JURI voting.

FFII has today distributed to JURI members paper copies of its own [:Plen05En: proposal for amendments] which is very similar in spirit to that of Rocard.  FFII is moreover planning a [:Konf0506En: conference in and near the EP on June 1st] and has issued a third [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/call/0504/ Call for Action], which asks the European Parliament to support the kind approach which Michel Rocard is proposing, while at the same time asking national parliaments to bring the European Patent Office and the Council of Ministers under control.
