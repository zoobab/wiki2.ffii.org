Preliminary results at 99.9%:

Fidesz (EPP): 12
MSZP (social democrats): 9
SZDSZ (liberals): 2
MDF (EPP): 1

Nothing definitive is known about the commitment of any parties on the swpat issue.

Some MSZP and SZDSZ headed ministries are known to say against swpats, an SZDSZ MP has been
positively active about it, but the government has yet to change its words to a vote in the Council.
(phm: this applies even to the German Greens, who can be trusted to vote clearly against software
patents.  how politicians behave as representatives of a ministerial patent bureaucracy and how they
vote in Parliament is a different matter.  Has the MEP candidate questionnaire campaign been conducted
in Hungary?).

Nothing has been heard from the EPP parties on the issue yet.
