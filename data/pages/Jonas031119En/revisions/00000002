In its attempt to press national ministers to quickly reject the European
Parliament's amendments to the proposed software patent directive, the
European Commission's Industrial Property Unit has circulated a document

trying to present those that limit patentability as logically flawed in
some way.  In order to do this, it makes a lot of unreasoned and provably
false statements.
