''Lehne first praises Kauppi for adopting the party line which he forced on her, then procedes to claiming that this directive is not about software and the Council's position is to prevent patents on pure software, and that small and medium companies in the software field are happy with the Council's position.''

Thank you president, ladies and gentlemen.

Ofcourse we give thanks to rapporteur and shadow raporteur, but here
in partucular I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur for our
group, Piia-Noora Kaupii who has done a great job here, and found some
excellent compromises to come up with the right solutions and shown
tremendous know-how here. I have as much admiration as is possible for
the job that she has done on this.

One thing I want to make perfectly clear, and it was clear in the
legal affairs commmitee there too.  Nobody, no political group, no
individual, wants software patents , well - some individuals might,
but that's not really what this is all about.

The point behind the directive was to prevent the development that has
taken place in the US and is taking place in Europe too. That is the
goal. And the common position meets that goal as well. We have heard
the chamber of commerce and industry in Munich and Upper Bayern and
they said to us that (that is btw, the part of Germany where they have
the biggest concentration of small business developing software), and
they feel that too, that the common position will solve their problems
and meet their requirements, but they can be improved none the less,
and in the legel affairs commitee we came up with a whole series of
decisive improvements in the form of 39 amendments, clarifications ,
new options being created, interoperabitily, technical definitions and
so on. Those are examples. It's a moderate report which is a good
attempt to solving the problems we have.

The Rocard amendments and those from other groups however have gone
way beyond this goal. They even refer to the Lisbon process. There is
nothing in the Lisbon process about the knowledge based economy in
Europe. All our knowledge depends on the skill of our people. So what
is going to happen if we have all these extreme amendments that go far
too far, if we go along with those, future generation in this
continent will loose the chance of livelyhood, and I think that is why
the vast majority of our group do not agree with those amendments.

The next important point is the refusal amendments, the refusal
amendments so called, to refuse the common position and send it back
to commission. There are two reasons to take this into consideration.
First of all, we are going to have to go through a long conservation
process on the basis on amendments in the legal affairs commitee and
then we could loose out at the end of the third reading by a simple
majority. Secondly we don't want to cause harm to Europe in general
and the Lisbon process in particular by means of these
amendments. That is the decision we have to make today.
