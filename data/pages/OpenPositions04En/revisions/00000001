= FFII open positions =

Distribution of labor and competencies is a time-honored method of work. The following positions are open. Picking a position at FFII gives you insight into finding the workings of an international grassroots ngo working at hot political topics ;) FFII currently has over 500 members and is entrusted by over 70,000 supporters for European patent policy.

Central positions are assigned without bias against gender, race, nationality or whatever, however basic communication skills in written english are appreciated (if you can read this they are probably sufficient). Generally to do your jobs you are free to choose the tools you need, asking for a (moderate) budget is welcome. If you subdelegate tasks that is welcome too.

If you are interested, here is [http://www.ffii.org/~blasum/people/ the current FFII team]. You can contact blasum(att)ffii.org for general positions or bkaindl(att)ffii.org / mwas(att)ffii.org for computing positions.
