Unfortunately, a member of EDRI (from consulting the minutes of the council) concluded
that Jürgen Trittin, a famous member of the German Green party voted the german '''yes''' on
May 18. However, that was completely wrong as it turned out after long tries of getting
the Video of the council meeting finally succeeded and we could finally check the video
to see who was there: http://wiki.ael.be/index.php/Council18MayVideo

As this video proofs, it was '''not''' Jürgen Trittin who (in the end) supported the
unmeaningful amended text but [[HansjoergGeigerDe| State Secretary Hansjoerg Geiger]]
of the [[SwpatbmjDe| Justice Ministry]] who actually handled the maneuvers on the software patent directive.

 Tuesday 18 May the Council of the European Union adopted by a qualified
 majority in its Competitiveness meeting a Common position for the Second
 Reading of the Software Patent Directive. The text is described by the
 Foundation for a free Information Infrastructure as 'the most
 uncompromisingly pro-patent text yet'. The Common Position, which was
 agreed upon by the 25 Member States' ministers in charge of Internal
 Market, Industry and Research, largely ignores a vote in the European
 Parliament last September to restrict patentability in a way that would
 have been in line with the European patent Convention and effectively
 rejected patentability of actual software.

 The text that the Council has voted for is regarded by many experts as
 being even worse than the initial Commission proposal, to which it adds
 direct patentability of computer programs, data structures and process
 descriptions. This extension of the focus seems to be the result of a
 shift in the internal balance of powers within the European Commission.
 The DG Internal Market, led by Dutch Frits Bolkestein and strongly in
 favour of software patents, increasingly prevails over DG Information
 Society, led by Erki Liikanen from Finland and mostly sceptical about
 software patents.

 In Tuesday's Council meeting, only Spain voted against the Draft Common
 Position; Austria, Italy and Belgium abstained. Before the decision, there
 had been rumours that more big member states such as Germany or France
 might vote against the proposal. That would have threatened the qualified
 majority who now adopted the position. The rumours about Germany were
 based on the words of Elmar Hucko, Ministerial Director in the Federal
 Department of Justice. A week ago, he told a demonstration of anti
 software patent activists in Berlin that the German government felt 'in
 substance closest to you' and that it wanted "under no circumstances
 American conditions in Europe... A patent must be a fair reward for a bona
 fide invention and not abused as a strategy to bludgeon competitors."
 However, the German Minister for the Environment, Juergen Trittin (Green
 Party), who represented his government, voted in favour of the Common
 Position.

 The European Parliament is expected to debate the proposition in Second
 Reading, starting in September in the Legal Affairs Committee. The
 rapporteur will most likely again be Arlene McCarthy (PSE, UK), who took a
 pro-software patent position already in First Reading. The Council Common
 Position is neither binding nor the basis for amendments, but
 approximating their vote to the Council's would increase MEPs' chances to
 avoid a Third Reading, which would possibly be followed by a Conciliation
 Procedure.
