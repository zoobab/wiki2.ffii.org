 * Here's [http://hubble.physik.uni-konstanz.de/felix/linux-desktop.txt a list] that I created when parsing some PR material. It was supposed to be for my personal notes, so it may be somewhat hard to read.
 * Pantent on the FAT file system (could be illustrated by a shell whose prompt shows "/dos/letters>" or similar) (Or any small-memory devices like CompactFlash, Digital Camera..)
 * [http://gauss.bacon.su.se/indices/ A list] of more than 20,000 EPO Software Patents. They can be easily navigated by clicking on [http://gauss.bacon.su.se/indices/keyword keywords].

= Drafts =

 * The Gimp related: CMYK patents (since the Gimp ''does not'' do it, maybe should be ImageMagick or one of the many apps linked to lib littlecms) <- The new Gimp-Version does support CMYK, AFAIK
 * Maybe a video player, since MPEG (ie. xvid, ffmpeg, divx and others) has a patent on it
 * I heard (to be checked) that the two-side-window mode of a file browser (see "view profile"->"windows commander" in Konqueror) is patented
 * The screenshot is very large and messy, it should be possible to gather every elements with only 3 or 4 applications opened

Problem: We shall not create the impression thast certain projects of the desktop are under threat. audio patents are for instance a treat to all patent holder.

I think we shall better not use a Linux desktop with knwon programms.

There are many intresting patents on unvisible things:
"virtual devices"

I thinkm this would be fun.
