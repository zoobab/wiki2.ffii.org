What will happen?
 * Speeches by Jonas.
 * An info stand with flyers, call for action 2, promotion material.
 * Maybe some spectacular action

Volunteer list for the info stand:
 * Dieter Van Uytvanck (Sat/Sun)
 * Philippe De Swert (Sat) 
 * Jonas Maebe (when not speeching :)

Ideas to draw peoples attention:
 * invite Stallman to the stand (people would like to talk to him and can do this at our stand drawing attention to swpats if they did not yet get the message. And I do not think RMS will object.)
 * wear the T-shirt from the action in Brussels (27 aug).
 * I (Philippe) have some pictures and videos from the Brussels action on my laptop, maybe we could show them on a screen.

Stuff needed :
 * CFA II printout (French/Dutch/English)
 * no epatents stickers
 * monitor or beamer to show the pictures

Stuff that is available :
 * At the booths there will be network connectivity (but please try to bring some switches/hubs and network cable if you intend to make use of it), eventually wi-fi (not sure yet), as well as power supply. Each stand is a table with a width of about 1m60-1m80.
 * The mega webshop versions (A0, like on Comdex) -> Fabien will bring them
 * 80 "protect innovation" t-shirts -> Fabien (openstuff.net)
 * progress bar stickers (English) -> Fabien
 * 2 patent gravestones -> Bram
 * a simple 10Mb 8port hub + some cables + power cable (3-plugs) -> Philippe
 * some banners from previous actions -> Benoit (will be at the Debian stand)
 * A5 flyers (English, webshop + flyer used at Comdex)
