A study conducted at the Department of Business Administration of Munich University on the "legal framework set by patent laws with respect to the patentability of business methods, contrasting the situation in Europe and the situation in the US."  Finds the standards for granting business method patents to be very similar.  Identifies 1901 European business method patents, finds that they spur litigation (opposition rate 44%) and are being used strategically, at least regarding postage devices.

== Confusing Law and Caselaw ==

The abstract of the study says that business methods have always been patentable in Europe and that other impressions are due to the lack of precision in the current law.

This is not true, as we can easily see from the earlier interpretations of this law in the Examination Guidelines and in the caselaw of the Board of Appeals and national courts.

See

However, the author explicitely bases his view of the law on [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/beresford00/|Keith Beresford's "Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention"]], which, by equating law with caselaw and treating the latter as authoritative for the understanding of the former, is deliberately uncritical of the patent judiciary.

Wagner writes:

  Since business methods are excluded from patentability only "as such",
  a clear definition of what is meant by a business method "as such" is
  needed for this purpose. Complicating the situation, there is no legal
  definition of what the "as such"-formulation actually means, leaving
  it open to interpretation. Hellfeld (1989) gives a comprehensive
  overview of different interpretations of the "as such"-restriction
  formed in numerous court decisions and the judicial
  literature. Because of the unclear meaning of the EPC's "as
  such"-formulation, the Board of Appeal finally ruled that this
  criterion can not be decisive for the distinction between patentable
  and not-patentable business methods. This view has been developed in a
  row of decisions concerning applications seeking patent protection for
  business methods and computer programs throughout the 90's.

Indeed the EPO began to render Art 52 EPC meaningless by a series of
decisions in the 1990s.  This however does not mean that these
decisions are based on adequate interpretations of the law.  When
there is a consensus in the patent world, written laws tend to mean
very little, and the wording "as such" then may just serve as a pretext
for a group of judges to circumvent the law.

See * http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/epc52/ on how this happened at
the EPO in the 1990s and how the law was correctly interpreted, also
with regard to business methods, before that.

Wagner goes on to summarise EPO caselaw and the current political situation:

  The criterion developed by the Board of Appeal in several cases for
  the distinction between patentable and non-patentable business methods
  is the technical character of the underlying invention/ method.8
  However, determining what lends an application of a business method
  patent the necessary technical character and takes it beyond the
  exclusion from patentability is extremely difficult. Again, there is
  no formal definition of this criterion. The relevant decisions of the
  Board of Appeal on the technical character of business method related
  patent applications during the 90's (listed in Hart et al. (2000) or
  also Tang et al. (2001)) can be summarized as follows: An invention
  has a technical character if there are technical considerations
  involved. These technical considerations may lie either in the
  underlying problem solved by the claimed invention, the means of
  solving the underlying problem, or in the technical effects achieved
  in the solution of the problem. Anders (2001) give a thorough
  treatment of what exactly determines the technical character of
  business related inventions from a legal perspective considering
  recent developments at the European level. His arguments can be
  summarized by stating that almost any computer-implemented invention
  is sufficiently technical making the criteria of novelty and inventive
  step decisive for a patent grant in Europe (Anders, 2001,
  p. 558). 

  Given this de facto patentability of business methods under certain (not
  well defined) circumstances, the European Patent Office currently
  advocates a change of the EPC that facilitates the patenting of
  computer programs and business methods to clarify the current complex
  situation (European Patent Office, 2000). However, at the diplomatic
  conference hosted by the EPO in November 2000 in Munich, European
  legislators declined to adopt these proposals. Nevertheless, Kober
  (2001) ­ the President of the EPO at that time ­ stated that the EPO
  will nevertheless continue to grant patents on business methods based
  on the current jurisdiction. 

  Meanwhile, the discussion reached policy
  makers at the European Community level who are currently discussing a
  new EU directive on the patentability of computer-related inventions
  with direct impact on the regulatory framework of the EPC: After a
  first vote by the European Parliament to maintain and reinforce the
  exclusion of software and business methods from patentability in
  September 2003, the Council of the Ministers of the European Community
  published a working paper opposing the Parliament's position. The
  working paper proposes to cancel almost all patentability limits for
  computer-implemented inventions agreed on by the parliament earlier
  (Council of the European Community, 2004). While it is currently
  unclear which of the two opposing positions
  will prevail at the EU level, it is obvious that under the
  applicable law patents on business methods are granted by the EPO as
  long as the underlying invention satisfies the criterion of being
  sufficiently technical as well as the other criteria of patentability.

This description is largely correct, except for its refusal to allow for
the possibility that the current caselaw has crossed the borderline of
what is a permissible interpretation of the written law.
