The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has published a 
[[http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/pdf/iprs_innovation.pdf|policy paper "Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation in SMEs"]]
which it advertises as follows:

   A new WIPO policy paper on "Intellectual Property and Innovation in
   Small and Medium-sized Enterprises" is now available on the WIPO
   website. The paper evaluates the importance of intellectual property
   for small and medium-sized enterprises, examines the main barriers
   faced by SMEs in making use of the IP system and analyzes government
   measures for encouraging a more effective use of the IP system by
   SMEs. The papers main focus is on countries that are members of the
   OECD. An edited version of the paper was included as a background
   document for the Second OECD Ministerial Forum for Small and
   Medium-sized Enterprises that took place in Istanbul on June 3 to 5,
   2004. 

The paper finds that the "IP system" (it refers exclusively to
the patent system and its extensions, e.g. utility models, here) is not
found useful by most small and medium enterprises and proposes remedies
to this problem.  These remedies of course do not consist in reducing 
but in increasing the number of patents granted.  In particular, "IP offices"
all over the world and governments are exhorted to involve !SMEs in new
and more powerful networks of patent experts.

The paper mentions the recent expansion of patentable subject matter to genetics, software,
and business methods and states dogmatically that "IP" is of central importance to the
functioning of the "knowledge economy", without asking whether broad exclusion rights
with the accompanying heavy management burdens are the right form of appropriation
for this kind of economy.

The paper cites more economic studies than some previous papers, but
the angle of discussion is limited to the question of how to promote
the patent system among !SMEs.

There's also some other information to be found in it, however:

  The rise of the information and telecommunications industries and the
  increasing importance of the services sector in the economy of OECD
  countries have also enhanced the importance of the copyright system as a
  tool for protecting the creative efforts of companies in, for example,
  the software and multi-media sectors, as well as in many other sectors
  which rely on creative work protectable by copyright.  The traditional
  focus of the copyright system on artists, musicians and writers, has
  increasingly expanded in the current economic context to include
  computer programmers and other new categories of creators in the
  entertainment, software or teaching industries, to name a few.
