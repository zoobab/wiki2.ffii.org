After yesterday's public support from Izquierda Unida (leftist party),
today we have a [:Valencia040514Es: public declaration] of the Regional Government of
Valencia (Partido Popular, conservatives). Valencia has a large program
of use of libre software in secondary education, and which is mainly
focused by the impact of software patents on software.

The note is very clear, stating that programs should not be patentable.
