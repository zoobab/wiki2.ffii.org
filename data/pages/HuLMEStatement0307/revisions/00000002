                                                          connection with his fight against patenting Neumann principle
                                                          
Dear Government,
Dear Parliament Parties,
Dear Members of European Parliament!

In the name of Association of Hungarian Linux users, I ask you this way to take steps
in every conceiveable place against accepting the directive on computer implemented inventions
in its current form. Please do so because inducing patentability of software either in open
or covert ways is not in the interest neither our country, nor the European Union.

The events of the recent times have been proven that this directive draft have a lot of
spaces to improve. Not just the Hungarian IT professionals, but also civil and political organisations
of more countries have, and expressed doubts concerning the quality of this directive draft.

We are facing a historical opportunity. We might make this directive better with our joint, work between
us, IT professionals, and you, politicians in the same way, as Neumann have made informatics
better with his work.

We believe that Hungary serves herself and Europa which has taken her in best if she helps restaring
the negotiations on the directive draft. After that we should reach the goal of drafting a
new directive which makes properly protecting the computer implemented inventions possible, an in the
same time makes open or covert protecting of software patents totally impossible.
