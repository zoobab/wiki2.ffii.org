''From June 1st to 15th, 2005, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) will host a public online forum, as a part of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). Everyone can post a comment about 10 themes. Each theme is accompanied by a text serving as a basis for reflexion.''

 * [http://www.wipo.int/ipisforum/en/ Home page of the public online forum]

Two themes are particularly relevant for software patents :

 * Theme 2 : [http://www.wipo.int/roller/comments/ipisforum/Weblog/theme_two_the_intellectual_property The intellectual property system and freedom of expression and creativity: Help or hindrance?]

A remark is about software patents:

"In the field of software, copyright and patent protection may act to prevent any one operating system from becoming a de facto standard."

 * Theme 3 : [http://www.wipo.int/roller/comments/ipisforum/Weblog/theme_three_the_public_domain The public domain and open access models of information creation: at odds with the intellectual property system or enabled by it?]

In this theme, the software patents apprear twice:

In the presentation, paragraph 7b:

"While patents grant exclusive rights to owners, it is clearly in their interests to place the invention on the market at a price that the market will absorb. [...] Another strategic choice may be to release patents into the public domain, as was done  some months ago by IBM, with a view to enhance the development of new products, in particular, in the software area by giving free access to certain technologies to other developers of the technology in question."

In the questions to consider:

"Are patent rights (e.g., software patents) consistent with need for interoperability in the Information Society?"
