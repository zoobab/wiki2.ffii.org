An "international company" (surely Microsoft) which has wilfully made
its web page incompatible with Opera paid the european shareware company

comments:

  This a new and impressive success for Opera. I think we should say more 
  often that we have market leaders supporting the cause of a free information infrastructure
  without software patents (Opera in the mobile phone
  market, WinRAR for compression utilities, oXygen from Europe Shareware for XML editors, etc).
