= 2004-05-17..8 Recording the Council Decision  =

As David Glaude (dglaude) writes,
there is a chance that the council debate on software patents might be
visible in Europe by Satelite. Then it become technically possible to
record this and serve it to all our friends wanting to know what took
place (This includes current and futur !MEPs that do not have access to
!EbS currently).

To make it happen:
 * we need to contact !EbS to make sure they show it live (or recorded)
 * we need someone (maybe with backup) to record the stream
 * we need some place to store it (http://media.ael.be/ ?)
 * we need someone to process the stream in order to reduce it size and make audio-only version
 * we need someone to put the stream on-line (like our SW friend)

Here are some information to further proceed if this action is of any value.

Some of these public debates will be broadcast - either live or
recorded - by the European Commission's audiovisual "Europe by
Satellite" information service. Information about this service can be
obtained by calling + 32 (0) 2299 1176
