Council and Commitee translations are done by the [[http://europa.eu.int/comm/scic|Directorate General for Interpretation  ]] of the European Commission, as reorganized in October 2003, with a staff of almost 900 (plus a huge amount of freelancers). The acronym SCIC is based on the french term for 'Joint Interpreting and Conference Service' which is maintained for historical reasons. 

The [[http://www.curia.eu.int/en/instit/services/interpretation/interpretation.htm|European Court of Justice]] and the 
[[http://www.europarl.eu.int/interp/public/default_en.htm|European Parliament]] have separate interpreting services. 

There are seperate rules for some working aspects internal to the Commission.

''Language as part of a people's identity and their linguistic diversity must, therefore, be respected; a basic principle in the Treaty that is regularly recalled by the Council of the Union. Today, Article 314 of the EC Treaty lays down the principle of multilingualism. Article 21 states that every citizen of the Union may write to any of the institutions or bodies in one of the languages mentioned in Article 314 and have an answer in the same language. Under the Treaty, the Council is required to take decisions on the rules governing the languages of the Community institutions. In fact, Article 1 of the very first regulation (which has been amended after each successive enlargement) decided by the Council of Ministers in 1958 listed the official languages of the Union:'' 

"The official languages and the working languages of the institutions of the Union shall be 
Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish."
  
''The regulation is amended again with the enlargement in 2004, adding Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovenian, Czech, Hungarian and Estonian.''

#### So it's 20 official languages now, see quotataions of (1) below.

''Internally, when European Commission staff hold meetings, no interpretation is provided: Officials are expected to be able to do without. The weekly meeting of the College of Commissioners has interpretation between English, French and German.''

''The new member states and their official EU languages:''

Czech Republic: czech

I couldn't find a consolidated version on the eu servers by now.
http://europa.eu.int/comm/scic/thescic/cr1958_en.htm only gives the original version from 1958, without any amendements. So here's a googled copy from www.vatplus.ch. The amending act for the 10 new languages of 2004 is not yet listed in the header. Instead the document refers to Article 20 of the Act of Accession, which refers to Annex II, which i didn't have available. Feel free to replace this with the official consolidated version.

(a) Basic texts

Article 290 of the TEC instructs the Council to determine unanimously the rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community `without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice'. It was therefore on that basis that on 15 April 1958 the Council adopted Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community (1), as amended by the various acts of accession. That regulation provides for 11 official
languages (Ireland waived the right for Irish to become an official language of the institutions of the Community) (2). The main provisions of that regulation are as follows.

 * The official languages and the working languages of the institutions of the Community shall be Spanish, Danish, German, Greek, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish.' (Article 1).

 * Documents which a Member State or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State sends to the institutions may be in one of the official languages selected by the sender, the reply being drafted in the same language, whereas documents which an institution sends to a Member State or to a person subject to its jurisdiction are drafted in the language of that State (Articles 2 and 3). Only the text in the languages used in that correspondence is authentic.

 * Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted in the 11 official languages and the Official Journal is published in those languages (Articles 4 and 5). All the linguistic versions are authentic.
     

(b) Arrangements for internal implementation (Article 14 of the CRP)

Under Article 6 of the abovementioned Council Regulation No 1, the institutions may stipulate in their rules of procedure which of the languages are to be used in specific cases, which the Council did in Article 14 of the CRP.

(i) The principle 

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 14 of the CRP, except as otherwise decided unanimously, `the Council shall deliberate and take decisions only on the basis of documents and drafts drawn up in the languages specified in the rules in governing languages' (i.e. the above Regulation No 1) (1).

<footnote> 

(1) Note that under the procedure provided for in Article 14(1) of the CRP (unanimous decision concerning deliberations and decisions on the basis of documents and drafts not drawn up in all the languages) when, under the Treaties, members of the Council or of Coreper may not participate in the vote, account is not to be taken of votes by such members (Annex I(1)(h) to the CRP).

</footnote>

'''The term `drafts' refers, in particular, to Commission proposals that must be submitted to the Council in the 11 official languages. This provision allows a delegation to oppose discussion of an item if, when the Council brings up the item, the relevant documentation is not available in the official language it prefers. Paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the CRP also enables each member of the Council to oppose discussion if the texts of any proposed amendments are not drawn up in such of the languages referred to in paragraph 1 as he or she may specify (2).'''

<footnote>

'''(2) A member of the Council or of Coreper may not make use of this provision in connection with ecisions on which, under the Treaties, that member may not participate in the vote (Annex I(2)(d) to the CRP.'''

</footnote>

'''If a document is not yet available in all 11 official languages, it can nevertheless be the subject of a `political agreement' on the substance. However, subject to the possible derogations set out below, that text may be adopted only if it is available in good and due form (i.e. finalised by the legal/linguistic experts) in the 11 official languages.'''

It is to be noted that:

 * a regulation or a directive addressed to all Member States or a decision addressed to all Member States cannot enter into force (nor, therefore, be published nor the Member States be notified of it) unless the text exists in the 11 official languages (Article 4 of Regulation No 1);

 * a common position of the Council adopted pursuant to the procedures referred to in  Articles 251 and 252 of the TEC is not forwarded to the European Parliament unless it is available in all 11 official languages.
   
      
(ii) Waivers

Article 14(1) of the CRP, in fact, allows for the possibility of waiving that rule, provided that the Council both decides unanimously and that it is a matter of urgency. That waiver is mainly used in the first few months following the accession of new Member States to the European Union as revised translations in their languages may not be available within the period laid down.
As stated above, the normal languages' rules apply in the fields under Title V of the TEU (CFSP). This was emphasised in a statement annexed to the TEU (1). In the CFSP field, however, Council acts may be adopted by a simplified written procedure (known as COREU, Article 12(4) of the CRP) (2) particularly adapted to urgent situations justifying recourse to the derogation provided for in
Article 14(1) of the CRP. Consequently, while the normal language rules apply to the adoption of any act in the CFSP field, in particular those having a legal scope (joint action or common position), the Council may nonetheless decide, on a case-by-case basis, on grounds of urgency, to act in the absence of texts in all the official languages, when it does not intend to publish the text of its decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It is desirable that this particular urgent situation be briefly mentioned in a recital of the act justifying, in the particular case, the waiving of the ordinary language rules.

In practice, whenever the Council has recourse to the waiver provided for in Article 14 of the CRP, it is necessary to:

 * indicate it in the documents submitted to it (report to the Council, `I/A' item notes);

 * record in the Council minutes the decision to have recourse to the waiver; 

 * likewise note any decision to postpone publication or notification of the act pending availability of the text in the 11 official languages;

 * provide, where appropriate, for subsequent adoption of the missing language versions by the Council.

It is to be noted that:

 * the addressee(s) of a directive or an individual decision may be notified of it in the language(s) of the Member State concerned without waiting for the text to be available in the 11 official languages (Article 3 of Regulation No 1);

 * a decision sui generis having no effect vis-à-vis third parties may enter into force without the text being available in the 11 official languages.

===  ===
=== 1. How it works ===
----

Interpreters talk about active and passive languages.

 * An active language is a language the interpreters speak that delegates can listen to.

 * A passive language is a language the interpreters understand that is spoken by the delegates.

 * Symmetric regime means that delegates can speak and listen to intepretation from the same languages.

 * A meeting with an 11-11 language regime has 11 passive and 11 active languages. In the European Union institutions this means that all the official languages are interpreted into all the official languages. Such a regime is called complete and symmetric.

 * Relay means interpreting via a third `bridging' language: language A is first put into language B, then into C by interpreters working from B.

 * Retour means the same interpreter who works from language A into B also works from language B into A

 * In an asymmetric regime, delegates can speak more languages than they can listen to. When we say a meeting has an 11-3 regime it means that delegates may speak all 11 official languages but that interpretation is only provided into 3 languages, say English, French and 

 * Reduced regime means that interpretation is provided from less than the full number of official languages. A meeting with an EN-FR-DE-IT-EL - EN-EL is called a 5-2 meeting, a meeting where delegates may speak English, French, German, Italian or Greek but interpretation is provided only into English and Greek. Such a meeting has a reduced asymmetric regime. It is foreseen that reduced and/or asymmetric regimes may become more common after enlargement in 2004.

===  ===
=== 2. What it costs ===
----

''Figures from "Giving you a voice in Europe" (DG SCIC 2004):''
 
Additional cost of interpretation after enlargement, in 2 scenarios, based on 200 working days per year at EU 666 per day:

 * 5 teams per day per language to ensure minimum coverage: 30 000 days or EUR 19 980 000/year                                                   
 * 40 interpreters per day per language (40 interpreters x 9): 72 000 days = EUR 47 952 000/year

The Interpretation DG's current annual total cost is EUR 105 000 000 or EUR 0.28 per citizen of the Union. Taking the minimalist option, the cost will actually be reduced to EUR 0.27 per citizen per year. When we reach full cruising speed of 40 interpreters per day, the cost will increase to EUR 0.31 per citizen. Until then, the actual cost will be somewhere between the two figures.


A [[http://europa.eu.int/comm/scic/thescic/multilingualism_en.htm|Comment  ]] by SCIC (Last updated: 29-08-2002)

--->

The comment is often made that the European Union is on its way to become a Babel of incomprehension at huge cost because of the many languages we work with. It is then proposed to reduce the number of languages. The number of languages is, of course, a political decision but there are a number of issues that makes reduction across the board difficult.

 * Democratic legitimacy of decision-making;
 * The need to actually understand what is being said by others;
 * The Member State governments each work in their national language. If there is no interpretation in Brussels there would need to be more translation in the Member States;
 * Political difficulty in deciding which languages to cut;
 * A central service ensures uniform quality across the many languages;
 * Economy of scale of central hiring of free-lance interpreters;
 * Relatively low cost of language services (all translation and interpretation in the European Union institutions cost per citizen in 2000 = the cost of a cup of coffee).

<---

===  ===
=== 3. Future development ===
----

The second main objective of DG SCIC is to prepare to meet these challenges. We want to be certain that we get the right technical solutions that will ensure efficient communication in meetings, cost-effectiveness and excellent working conditions. In order to pursue this objective, the SCIC created a unit for Conference Interpretation and New Technology in 2000. It coordinates more than 100 volunteer (interpreter) members of staff who take part in exploring and testing new communication tools and searching for ways to bring multilingualism to new channels of  communication. On the one hand, we intend to make choices with full knowledge of the facts and not under the pressures of industry or of financial interests other than those of the Institutions. On the other hand, in a field that is likely to have a profound influence on the work situation, it would be counter-productive to improvise simplistic solutions without consulting the interested parties. The work of the unit is currently focused on 8 fields:

 * multilingual chats on the Internet;
 * multilingual communication in the media;
 * multilingual virtual conferences;
 * language engineering (speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, etc.)
