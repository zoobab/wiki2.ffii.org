''Brussels, 1 July 2005 -- Members from all political sides are showing their support for 21 cross-partisan compromise amendments to the European software patent directive. The European Parliament is clearly readying itself to gather the required 367 votes to amend the Council's proposal in the second reading, scheduled to take place on July 6th.''

Mr [:MichelRocardEn: Rocard], the rapporteur and former Prime Minister of France, has tabled the cross-partisan amendments in the name of the PSE group. The amendments have also been tabled by the IND/DEM (with one small change), the Greens/EFA and the GUE/NGL groups. They are also tabled by prominent representatives of the ALDE and EPP-ED groups.

Members of the European People's Party (EPP-ED, conservatives and christian-democrats) Zuzana Roithová (Czech Republic) and former Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek have rallied a group of 55 EPP !MEPs who tabled the 21 amendments providing a platform for an alternative position within their party. The situation is reminiscent to what happened during the EP's first reading, when a group of !MEPs led by [:PiiaNooraKauppiEn: Piia-Noora Kauppi] challenged the official EPP party line.

Once more, the "official EPP party line" contains far-reaching proposals to impose heavy burdens on !SMEs under the label "reasonable and non-discriminatory" (RAND) licenses and would make it impossible for the European Parliament to garner majority support for a coherent alternative to the Council text.

The 21 cross-partisan amendments have also been tabled by MEP Andrew Duff "and others". This means that at least 37 members of the ALDE (Liberal) group are now officially showing support for a line similar to that [http://swpat.ffii.org/log/05/lymec04/ recommended by the European Liberal Youth association LYMEC].

Any amendment to be adopted in the second reading will require strong support. The reason is that for an amendment to pass, it requires support from a majority of the "component members" of the parliament, which is 367 !MEPs. In practice, this means that every "abstain" vote will be a vote in favour of the Council text. Therefore, all !MEPs will actively support one position or the other with each and every vote they cast (or do not cast).

On a related note, the [http://www.economic-majority.com/ "Economic Majority against Software Patents"] initiative almost doubled its support since the official launch on Monday last week. The platform now represents over 1,650 companies employing almost 30,000 people and with a turnover of over 3,188 billion euro, with new companies joining daily. The website also already features 66 individual testimonies in which business owners explain how software patents would affect their enterprise.
