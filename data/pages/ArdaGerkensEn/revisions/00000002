''Arda Gerkens is a member of the Dutch Parliament (Tweede Kamer) and member of the Socialist Party (SP).  Gerkens succeded in filing a motion against the government's pro-software-patent policy that won the support of part of the governing coalition in a close vote on 10 February 2005, thereby helping to delay decisions in the Council.''
