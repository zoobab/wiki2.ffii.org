 * 2004-12-09 jmaebe removed duplicate mention of Heise coverage of council delay
 * 2004-11-20 jmaebe removed second mention of "monopolies of the mind" editorial from The Economist (it's already below in the news)
 * 2004-11-18 André added a retorte article "2004-11-18 EU FFII Background Commission had strong reservations against program claims deception (Article 5.2)" with the function to draw attention of readers to the issue of program claims.
 * 2004-11-17 dietvu changed the --> into -> for FT.com article as a workaround for a rss generator bug (splits > in >..., resulting in an XML error)
 * 2004-11-17 jheald reverted the item about Apple DRM and Virgin to SwpatcninoEn. Shows limitations of competition law in preserving interoperability. (Article 6a). Apple's ability to lock-out reverse engineering of its protocol can only by anchored by patents.
 * 2004-11-17 jmaebe moved item about Apple DRM and Virgin to FfiinewsEn, has nothing to do with patents
 * 2004-11-11 somebody created sections again, jmaebe complained and arebenti reversed it.
 * 2004-10-12 phm made SwpatcninoEn writable only after login.  All active FFII * members have an editor login.  In view of intensifying absue of our wiki for search engine spamming (= replacement of a page or parts of it with lists of commercial links) this has become difficult to avoid, and we we are trying it out in the hope that productivity will not significantly drop.
 * 2004-10-12 phm moved ItalianMeeting04En announcement to FfiiprojNewsEn where it belongs (see section "other news pages" below)
 * 2004-10-06 jmaebe removed "[[http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/07/0029252|Slashdot: Nose-implemented inventions]]", this is not about software patents (and the article is pure speculation about how smells could possibly be patented in the future) (phm finds the Slashdot text of poor quality but believes that it is within the range of SwpatcninoEn subject matter, see also Greg Aharonians site [[http://www.patenting-art.com/|patenting art]]: we don't have a more appropriate news page for questions of limits of patentability)
 * 2004-09-21 jmaebe removed "BSA applauds John Bruton's appointment." after EUReporter artcile on swpats and democracy. If you think that is important, add a separate item, and maybe also link to a page describing what he has to do with software patents.
 * 2004-09-10 jmaebe moved another Sender ID article to SenderID0409En
 * 2004-09-07 someone reorders the news page, introducing subheadings; phm reverts and makes page require login; this restriction is later removed again
 * 2004-09-03 phm moves exhortation "Please do '''NOT''' add ..." from news page to meta page (section "exhortations" below)
 * 2004-08-26 jmaebe news item on [[http://news.google.com/?ned=us&ncl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/business/2004-08-25-ms-tw-drm-euro_x.htm&filter=0|MS probe regarding DRM]] removed, has nothing to do with patents.
 * 2004-08-25 jmaebe [[http://www.computerweekly.com/articles/article.asp?liArticleID=130034&liFlavourID=1&sp=1|linux free of copyright violations article]] removed, it has nothing to do with patents. (phm: wasn't it at least worth moving to FfiinewsEn?  And, in a wider sense, the SCO-type legal terrorism has to do with patents)
 * 2004-08-05 phm [[http://news.softpedia.com/news/2/2004/August/9174.shtml|softpedia limux news]] moved to Limux040804En -- if you think it deserves a place on the top of the main newsticker, please chose a heading that makes clear why and put a link to the Limux040804En page in brackets
 * 2004-08-04 phm: !InternetNews article "Linux's patent risk" removed: it is already in Osrm040802En
 * 2004-07-30 phm: subjective comments removed ("great article!", "trivial patent").  We want factual news reporting only!  The news page is not a blog for lyrics from anonymus!
 * 2004-07-27 phm: news about media echo on Rosen and HP Memo integrated into existing kwiki reporting 
 * 2004-07-26 phm: page created

== Some Advice ==

 * Please do '''NOT''' add everything with the words "Microsoft", "Linux" or "copyright" in it. This is an overview of news about ''(software) patents''.  Add other items to the [[FfiinewsEn| Information Infrastructure News page]] instead.
 * Don't try to improve the structures of this page.  If you want more neatly classified news, transfer them to other more specialised pages, such as [[ConsRevers04En| Council Reversal]] or [[SwpatnlEn| Netherlands]], which should usually start with a "News and Chronology" section.
 * [[http://wiki.ffii.org/IVSZ040826En|Example how non-English language news/press releases can be handled, Hungarian in this example.]]. Of course you also could add it to http:SwpatcninoHu but then the readership is Hungarian-only (though sometimes that matters more than international, so doing both is another option.)

== Naming Conventions ==

If your news item is more than one line long, fork it out into a separate wiki page.
The wiki page should be [[PagNomEn| named]] like Cons040129En, i.e. Stem+year+month+day+Language.

Find more explanations on naming at PagNomEn

== Moving Items to Other News Pages ==

Some newsitems are moved to other pages, where they are more appropriate, e.g.

 * Swpatcnino04En -- News of 2004: more appropriate for some news that are already too old (currently there is no page for 2003 and backward, so everything that's too old goes here)
 * FfiinewsEn -- Information Infrastructure News: more appropriate in cases that are of interest to FFII but not related to patents
 * FfiiprojNewsEn -- Project News: more appropriate in case of news that are of interest to ffii supporters rather than to the public at large.
