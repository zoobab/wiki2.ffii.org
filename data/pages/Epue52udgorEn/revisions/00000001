[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19670837.HTM Swedish patent law] recently got a bit cleaner when the old "utgör"* (/constitute,form, make/) was replaced by "är" (/is/):

'''Som en uppfinning anses aldrig vad som enbart är'''
 1. en upptäckt, vetenskaplig teori eller matematisk metod,
 2. en konstnärlig skapelse,
 3. en plan, regel eller metod för intellektuell verksamhet, för spel eller för affärsverksamhet eller ett datorprogram,
 4. en presentation av information.
There is no "as such" clause in Swedish Law. The header literally says "As an invention is never regarded what alone is... a computer program". The text is conformant to [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html EPC 52.2]:

'''The following in particular shall not be regarded as inventions within the meaning of paragraph 1:'''
 (a) discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods;
 (b) aesthetic creations;
 (c) schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers;
 (d) presentations of information. 
*old version: Som en uppfinning anses aldrig vad som enbart ''utgör''...

In fact, there actually isn't really any difference "software as such" and "software."
 programs as such = programs as programs
 X1 as such = X1 as X1
"such" is simply a pronoun referring to the last nominal item mentioned.


The syntactic context must be preserved when interpreting the phrase. Creating a nominal group "software as such" and asking what that means is the wrong approach.  There is no such nominal group in the law at all. This is a bit like taking the "it" in "it is raining" out of context and asking what mysterious entity this "it" is that is raining there.
