 * Article 5
 * Baseline: Council text [http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st11/st11979-re01.en04.pdf pdf]

== Article 5.1 ==

||  number  ||  submitter  ||  recommendation  ||  text  ||
||  ***  ||  Council  ||  ()  ||  Member States shall ensure that a computer-implemented invention may be claimed as a product, that is as a programmed computer, a programmed computer network or other programmed apparatus, or as a process carried out by such a computer, computer network or apparatus through the execution of software.  ||
||  22  ||  JURI 22  ||  +  ||  Member States shall ensure that a computer-aided invention may be claimed only as a product, that is a programmed apparatus, or as a technical process carried out by such an apparatus.  ||

Useful clarification/simplification; and underlines that patents must be for a ''technical'' process.

== Article 5.2 ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Council | () | A claim to a computer program, either on its own or on a carrier, shall not be allowed unless that program would, when loaded and executed in a programmable computer, programmable computer network or other programmable apparatus, put into force a product or process claimed in the same patent application in accordance with paragraph 1. |
| 48 = 80 = 101 = 122 = 143 = 166 | Rocard / Buzek 9 | ++ | A patent claim to a computer program, either on its own or on a carrier, shall not be allowed. |
| 66 | ALDE: Bowles | ? |  A claim to a computer program, either on its own or on a carrier, shall not be allowed. Member States shall ensure that the unauthorised supply or import of a computer program which is an essential element of a product or process validly claimed in accordance with paragraph 1 shall constitute an infringement. |

Program claims would prevent code fragments being published for legitimate discussion and non-commercial experimentation; prevent legitimate alternative use of the program; and prevent competition by EU companies in overseas territories where the patent did not apply.

Am. 66 would protect the EU exporters;  but it would still prevent unauthorised publication for legitimate discussion, legitimate experimentation, and legitimate alternate use.  What is missing is a test that the program is being supplied with the knowledge, reasonable expectation, or intention that it would be used to infringe the patent.

== Article 5.2 b' (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 49 = 81 = 102 = 123 = 144 = 167 | Rocard / Buzek 10 | + | The creation, publication or distribution of information can never constitute a patent infringement. |

Freedom of publication, as stipulated in Art 10 ECHR, can be limited by copyright but not by patents. Patent rights are broad and unsuited for information. These amendments do not make any patents invalid, but affirm the importance of not restricting freedom and openness of discussion.

== Article 5.2 a (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 64 | ALDE: Prodi | - | Member States shall ensure that computer-aided inventions are protected by copyright. Patents may be claimed by the inventor as a further protection, subject to full disclosure of the invention. |

Not really the right place for this amendment.  The topics it treats are already considered in more depth elsewhere.

== Article 5.2 a' (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 23 | JURI 23 | + | Where individual elements of software are used in contexts which do not involve the realisation of any validly claimed product or process, such use will not constitute patent infringement. |

A basic principle of patent law, so essentially harmless.   But doesn't help against program claims.

== Article 5.2 b (new) ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 24 | JURI 24 | o | A claim as described in paragraph 2 only gives protection for the use which is described in the respective patent.|

False comfort.  If a program has multiple uses, and you prevent it being published because one use is infringing, you have also prevented it being published for a use which is not infringing.
