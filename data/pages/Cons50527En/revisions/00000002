''Below you can find the official attach√©s (civil servants/diplomats) report of the Council Working Party on Intellectual Property (Patents)" meeting of 27 May 2005, where they discussed the software patents directive.''

Delegates of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Hungary actively promote the most uncompromisingly crude pro-patent views, in diametric opposition to decisions from their national parliament.  UK showed a certain flexibility and refinement in promoting its pro-patent agenda.  Only Poland clearly supports the amendments that are needed to exclude pure software from patentability. Italy seems willing to follow Rocard.  Malta tends to follow more patent-critical delegations.  Luxemburg supports interoperability.  Denmark largely abstains from the discussion due to "sensitivity" of the issues.
