This year again a committee of 160 jurors, among them leading personalities of the Linux world, [http://www.linuxnewmedia.de/Award_2004/en voted on the Linux New Media Award].

In the category "SPECIAL AWARD  - for outstanding promotion of Linux and Open Source", "Eurolinux/FFII" was chosen as Nr. 1 among many prominent candidates, including Creative Commons, [http://www.groklaw.org/ Groklaw], the Government of Brazil and [http://www.fsfeurope.org/ Free Software Foundation Europe].  

The prize awarding ceremony was conducted at Linux World Expo as part of the Exhibitor's Evening (wednesday 2004-10-27 18.30 Uhr, Hall 4.0, room "Europa").  [:ArnimRuppEn: Arnim Rupp] received the prize on behalf of FFII.

Arnim explained in a short thanks speech that FFII has not done much to "promote Linux and Open Source", but we have helped maintain and promote a regulative framework in which the free software world has a fair chance to prosper.  Arnim summarised how the (free and proprietary) software community won a series of uphill battles against the patent community and encouraged the audience to continue to fight hard to remove the latter's grip of the EU Council.  Although individual efforts were the key to success, the struggle also required some community effort with an increasing organisational and financial burden, which FFII had been shouldering and whereby it had been dramatically growing.  Arnim described the efforts and the growth and called on the audience for support.
