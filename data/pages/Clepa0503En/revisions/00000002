This summary links to the blog of André Rebentisch. His notes do unveil
several facts about the current discussion making process
in the EU about the softwarepatents directive.

He states:
 * "Campaign for Creativity" (C4C) is a Nokia funding, that got used for lobbying and is thus strongly related to the EICTA position.
 * CLEPA, a lobby organisation of the automotive industry, is just driving another attempt of "informing" !MEPs on the "status quo", that it declares the "formally adopted" controversial council decision.
 * The current argues from those partys are crude in itselves and there is no good reasoning at all for doing such argue. So that most of that argue will not withstand and therefore discredit its respective authors rather fast, if getting probed.
 * The patent system is a national system. You dont need to establish or extend such a system to get protection elsewhere.
 * The patent system is a sledge hammer to an object, whilst copyright is a precision tool to the very same object.

Several thrilling quotes of the misc interested partys are included.
