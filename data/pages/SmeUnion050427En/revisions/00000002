== Notes ==

=== Introduction by Ms Kauppi MEP: ===

 * Council Common Position brings software patents
 * will table amendments on art 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
 * Many new member states were not really well prepared on 18th May (Council political agreement)
 * most important amendments: interoperability and data processing
 * Parliament will improve the Common Position
 * same arguments as the [[Juri050421En| 21th April JURI meeting]]

=== Intervention of Mr Wuermeling MEP: ===

 * Grey area between Copyright and Patent law (did not understand what he wanted to point out)
 * There is copyright infringement when you make another implementation of a computer program (completely false, and corrected by one attendee); surprising mistake from a ex-shadow rapporter for this directive

=== Intervention of Mr Bock (Austria): ===

 * Members of FEC found a agreement with Open Source community in Austria around a position which permits patents for dataprocessing
 * Open Source is not a problem
 * Emotional debate

=== Intervention of Mr David Sant (European Patent Office): ===

 * "Why do Open Source developers do not obtain patents, it can be good for them"
 * Cheap patents
 * Bad image of EPO with this directive
 * Preparatory work of the EPC in 1973
 * SMEs and small players do not have access to patent information

=== Questions of the audience ===

 * Intervention of someone from the Swedish Enterprises
 * Question from Erik Josefsson (FFII) if Mr Sant can confirm that Microsoft is applying 2 or 2.5 patents per day at the EPO (answer from Mr Sant: I cannot confirm this number)
 * Question regarding the cost of litigation (average price of a trial, lawyers fees) and calculation of the damages; representative from the CEC said that damages were calculated in function of the royalties that the patent owner ask. Still unclear whether who fix the price of the royalties and if they are published or not.
 * Question of a Polish programmer who is the author of 10 pieces of software, and he looked at the US patents, he was saying that he probably violates some 100 patents. How can a developer can have the legal certainty about what he writes?
 * Question about the compulsory licensing for deaf or blind people (no answer)

=== Discussion with members of the Commission ===

 * Commission is listening to companies that complains
 * Big telcos companies have complained that it was unacceptable for them to do not have patents on protocols
 * Digital TV manufacturer (probably Philips) has complained that it was unacceptable for them to see data processing excluded from patentability
 * Commission believes they have the right to withdraw the directive project if they are not happy with it
 * Commission believes that Council needs unanimity on amendments CEC don't like in second reading '''and''' in conciliation. The Treaty does not mentions that unanimity is required in conciliation.
