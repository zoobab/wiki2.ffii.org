''The Hague, 3 July 2006. Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) unanimously concluded that the European Commission has no competence to propose a directive to criminalise intellectual property infringements. According to the Parliament, the Commission interprets a recent European Court of Justice decision (C-176/03) too broadly.''

----

The possibility for the European Commission to make directives containing criminal measures together with the European Parliament was opened by the recent European Court of Justice decision. With this possibility the member states lose their veto. 

FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: "The European Commission and the member states are now in the process of delineating competence: How far can the Commission go? In this power struggle the Dutch Parliament made its statement: the Commission went much too far. Earlier Dutch minister of Justice Donner already stated he was not 'pleased' ."

The Commission can only make directives with criminal measures if these measures are essential for an essential objective of the Community. The objective in this case is the realisation of the single market, this presupposes that without the directive  a distortion in trade between member states would occur. According the Dutch Parliament this is not the case, no more means are needed, but prioritizing and exchange of information may  be more important. The Parliament also observes that the Commission does not state that criminals would go to the member state having the lowest penalties, thus all factual foundation is missing. The criminals would soon become punishable in the member state having the higher penalty anyway. Additionally the Parliament mentions a directive on civil enforcement of "intellectual property rights" currently being implemented by the member states. The high damages may be seen as sanctions.  

The proposed directive would make all intentional commercial scale infringements of "intellectual property rights", including patents, a criminal offence. Since it is well known that it is impossible to write software without infringing any software patents, the directive will criminalise the entire software sector.

Professional software users may violate patents even if they own a valid copyright license. Since professional use of software is intentional and on a commercial scale, such used will also be covered by the directive's terms.

FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: "The stated aim of the directive is to combat piracy and organised crime, but the directive goes much further. Companies which are not pirates are criminalised too. We can only hope that the Dutch Parliament's strong condemnation will wake up people and parliaments all over Europe."

== Background information ==

 * Full name of the directive: Directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights, 2005/0127 (COD)

 * English translation (by the FFII) of the conclusion of the adopted text: 

 Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) conclude that no competence
 has been granted to the Community for the intended action's desired aim. Both Chambers
 have nonetheless - unnecessarily - submitted the directive in question to the
 principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and concluded that the proposal fails to
 meet these tests."

 * Original Dutch conclusion (nr KST98457):

  Beide Kamers der Staten-Generaal concluderen dat voor de na te streven doelstelling
  van het voorgenomen optreden geen bevoegdheid aan de Gemeenschap is toegekend.
  Niettemin hebben beide Kamers onderhavig voorstel  ten overvloede  onderworpen
  aan de beginselen van subsidiariteit en proportionaliteit en geconcludeerd dat het
  voorstel daaraan niet voldoet."
