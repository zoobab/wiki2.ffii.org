54 is similar to the amendment adopted in first reading, except that "implemented" was replaced with "assisted" and the reference to the EPC has been dropped, so it compromises with Commission criticism that the EPC cannot be embedded in EU law like that. 24 is similar.

Amendment 53 is similar to 54, except that it changes that phrasing to "in the sense of patent law". It mixes statutory subject matter and novelty, however.

Amendment 50 = 51 simplifies the first reading amendment and also uses the "in the sense of patent law" phrasing.

Amendment 52 is also a simplified version of the first reading, keeping the "in the sense of patent law".

Amendment 55 is a weakened version of the first reading, by removing the requirement that the invention provides technical features ("technical" is removed, and "must" has been replaced by "should". Additionally, it still contains the "within the meaning of the EPC" phrasing.

56 takes on board the Commission and Council-criticised "within the meaning of the European Patent Convention", and leaves the Council text alone for the rest.
