Software companies are regularly enlisted as members of associations which, while providing certain individual services for their members, at the political level, work against the interests of these members.  The '''sektor''' project of FFII tries to find ways to improve our communication with software companies and work toward better forms of trade organisation and representation.

== WIPO: SMEs contribute 90% to GDP of many countries ==

  WASME = World Association of Small and Medium Enterprises

  Workshop in Geneva from May 3 to 6, 2004, about 25 participants

  Report dated Geneva, May 11, 2004

  Date: Thu, 13 May 2004 10:53:34 +0200 (CEST)
  From: publicinf@wipo.int
  To: pressinfo-en@lists.wipo.int
  Subject: Update 224: WIPO WASME Special Program Highlights Importance of\ 
           Intellectual Property for Small and Medium Enterprises (Smes)

  [...]
  SMEs are a highly dynamic and economically important sector
  contributing more than 90% of the gross national product (GNP) of many
  countries.
  [...]

Given that practically all sectors (not just SW suppliers but SW
users) are/will be affected by swpat, this number is worth
mentioning.

== Software-Offensive Bayern: 80% of IT employment in Bavaria in SMEs ==

Software-Offensive is a program run by the bavarian government to establish
Bavaria as a key IT region in Europe.

According to figures given by SOB, the Munich region has 260k, Nuernberg 90K people employed in
the IT sector.  Of these 80% work in !SMEs.  The weight of !SME employment is even higher in
the software sector, because the big companies, such as Siemens, are mainly active in the
hardware-related IT fields.

The people in the Bavarian Ministry of Economics who are in charge of SOB are not enthusiastic
about the positions of [:SwpatjwuermelingEn: Joachim Wuermeling].
