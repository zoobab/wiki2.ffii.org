== Participant Information for Brussels conference 09/10 Nov ==

(informal addendum to the [://eu.ffii.org/sections/bxl0411/index/: http://eu.ffii.org/sections/bxl0411/index/ official site], it is recommended that you print this page out before leaving, contact blasum(at)ffii.org for other addenda or if you experience any difficulties editing this page)

=== Messages from Participants to other Participants ===
 * Feel encouraged to invite your journalist contacts and MEP contacts to the conference! (Note: we will try everything to make some last-minute accreditations up until Monday morning (whereas accreditation can still be done on-the-spot in Park Hotel, we have only a limited and opaquely defined number of last-minute slots at least for Parliament on Wednesday, that's why we asked '''you''' to register earlier)

=== Evening activities and social events ===

 * Those already arriving on __Monday__ night are welcome to join an informal get-together at Park Hotel Bar 18:00-19:30 (and we will leave a pointer at the Park Reception +32 2 7357400 where some people will eat afterwards ;).
 * On the evening of __Tuesday__ night there is a Dinner at Park Hotel (if you are unsure, that is the "main" social event of our conference)
 * On the evening of __Wednesday__ night, EIF invites to a [http://www.eifonline.org/site/index.cfm?TID=1&BID=16&SID=1&LG=2&ART=46&back=47 debate on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions] (separate registration, details see also program). 

=== Practicalities ===

 * If you are still in doubt on which day to come (eg coming from nearby), the Parliament room on Wednesday is bigger. Please tell the registration desk (feedback(at)ffii.org) of changes in your planning.
 * Videostreaming of the conference has been asked for! http://sr-server.ruc.dk/adm/ffii/
 * At daytime wireless access has been asked for both in Parliament and in Park Hotel, but please don't rely on this.
 * The registration desk will offer to participants a paper list of participants with the name, email, affiliation (if you gave us any), city, country (but '''not''' street address and zipcode for privacy reasons). If you either want '''not''' to be listed or want to provide additional data (eg a phone number), feel free to contact.
 * If you need to make a hotel room payment (you are not a speaker nor has a room been promised to you by other agreements), pick your favorite financial interface from !http://www.ffii.org/assoc/money/account/, use the remark "bxl0411 hotel" as transfer comment. If payment does not arrive before you, we might contact you in some cases, but you generally shouldn't worry about it (no need to do express transfers...).
