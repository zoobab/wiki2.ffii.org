Toine Manders, "intellectual property expert" of the European Parliament's Liberal (ALDE/ELDR) group, member of the Bolkestein party (VVD) from the Netherlands, habitually sides with lobbies that favor stronger enforcement of the broadest possible "intellectual property" rights.  When such a position becomes indefensible within the EP Liberal group, Manders tries to take an approach of rejecting it on procedural or other formalistic grounds.

 * 2004-09-00 Manders fights hard for Bolkestein line on software patent directive but is forced to compromise.  
 * 2004-06-17 Manders recommends both an amendment in favor of program claims and one in favor of freedom of publication to his party in JURI vote, with the result that freedom of publication isn't put to vote because program claims are (correctly) thought of by JURI as excluding the latter.  In other words: Manders uses legal tricks to fool his party group into supporting a pro-patent line which they don't want to support.
