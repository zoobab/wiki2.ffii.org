According to Council documents, the software patent directive was scheduled to be adopted as an A item (without discussion) at the environment Council next monday, the 20th of december 2004, along with a bathing water managment directive.  Later in the afternoon it was moved to the Agriculture & Fisheries Council of tuesday, to conform with what Minister Brinkhorst had told the Dutch Parliament, which has been regularly complaining about misinformation by the ministry.

Ante Wessels (Vrijschrift/FFII) reports: 

  This morning the NL ministry of economic affairs stated to a journalist that
  "monday" was a mistake in the agenda, that it will be tuesday.

  Probably at the end of the meeting monday the ministers will look at each
  other and ask: did we do it? Well, what do we know? Nobody ever tells us
  something.

== What Governments can still do ==

Governments and their representatives are still free to

 * add a unilateral declaration (like Latvia, which supports the proposal for formal reasons but stated clear opposition in a declaration, or the Dutch government, which mentioned an opposing motion from its Parliament)
 * ask for votes to be recounted, the issue to be treated as a B-item.
