 On Council first reading it has the following comment:
 "The Council finalises its position on the basis of the Commission?s 
 proposal, amended where necessary, in the light of the European 
 Parliament?s first reading and resultant amendments."

 In sweden we say "trollen spricker i solen", meaning "the trolls crack 
 in the sunlight".
