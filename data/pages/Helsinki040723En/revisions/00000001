On the last stop of their Baltic tour RMS, Marco Schulze and Christian Engström did their speeches before a Finnish
audience in a roughly half-filled auditorium (capacity 108 seats) in the capital region. As in previous events
RMS managed to capture the audience very well during his speech. Unfortunately there was no time for any questions 
directed to RMS as he had to rush to the airport directly after finishing his speech in order to catch his flight 
back home. However, when Marco and Christian were done with their speeches we had a reasonably active Q & A session 
(which does not always happen in Finnish conditions). The exact composition of the audience is (still) unknown but 
it contained several Nokia employees who seemed to agree with us on the issue. From the press we managed to get 
at least one important one, a reporter from STT which is an agency that sells articles to many newspapers.
This was distributed to the audience in paper format: http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/needs/
