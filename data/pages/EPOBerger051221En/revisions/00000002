''Before Christmas 2005 the European Patent Office published a study by German consultancy company Roland Berger. In August 2004 the study was first presented to the EPO according to the document. The late publication of the study raises questions as the study confirms the extraordinary transaction costs intensity of the European patent system. In the context of the heated software patenting debate in late 2004 these figures were likely kept secret in defense of the software patenting pratice of the EPO which the European Council proposal wanted to codify. The only substantial proposal for cost reduction given by the Roland Berger study is to reduce languages to English only. A survey on the cost of patenting is based on 253 telephone and postal interviews among EPO patentees located in Europe, the US and Japan. The study also tracks inhouse costs of patenting.''

Conceptual protection rights for software have to be '''cheap''', '''fast''' and '''narrow'''. Existing Patent law does not fulfil these requirements. See also: [[IndpropEn| Industrial copyright discussion]]
