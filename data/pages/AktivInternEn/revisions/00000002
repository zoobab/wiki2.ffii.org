== Building blocks ==
(The division between front-end and back-end concerning implementation of "business-rules" is somewhat fuzzy. This has of - course - historical reasons...)

=== Front-end  ===
 * GUI + various process-flow (e.g. signup+payment procedure) + "business-rules" (e.g. amount of membership contribution)
 * Consists of the CGI script "eintrag" (no .pl extension here) and the Knecht-Aktiv glue code in !Aktiv2Knecht.pm
 * eintrag.b is a separate copy of the script for beta testing
 * All data is saved to and requested from the Knecht back-end.
 * Written in Perl (procedural - OO rewrite planned)
 * Uses HTML::Template, HTML::!FillInForm and Mail::Sendmail (all on CPAN)
 * Performs extensive data validation based on Data::!FormValidator (see CPAN)
 * Sends out eMail to user asking for confirmation of receipt of eMail (address verification)
 * Sends out eMail to buero@ffii.org when a new user signs up
 * Author: mwas AT ffii DOT org
 * --> AktivDeveloperFAQ
 * Aktiv uses (has to use) the Knecht naming conventions, see http://www.ffii.org/verein/profil/profil.de.txt

=== Back-end ("Knecht" aka Knecht.pm) ===
Takes data requests from the front-end and uses 2 redundant storage systems for user data 
 * text-based storage of user profiles (1 profil.txt file per user)
 * parallel storage in a Postgres database
 * Also implements some "business-rules" 
 * Author: phm AT ffii DOT org
 * --> KnechtEn

Knecht also manages a MEP database and a patent database.
Knecht also has an eMail interface described at http://www.ffii.org/verein/knecht/index.en.html

=== Explanation of Database Schema  ===
 * DB name is "ffii"
 * Primary User table is "pnom"
 * Todo: Use Postgres COMMENT ON feature!
 * For historical reasons (since the primary data store originally was text-based), most definitions are found here: http://www.ffii.org/verein/profil/profil.de.txt
