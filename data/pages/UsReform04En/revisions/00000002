''The emergence of non-producing entities which use patents to prey on large companies such as Microsoft has prompted a movement of large companies to impose a few procedural reforms in the US patent system, designed specially to make it more difficult for (small) patent owners to assert their rights, and to give more money to the USPTO.  In 2004 the proposals, which were channelled through Microsoft proxies such as BSA and ACT, reached the US Congress.  It remains to be seen whether the patent lobby can control the subsequent discussion as well as it controlled the proposals.''
