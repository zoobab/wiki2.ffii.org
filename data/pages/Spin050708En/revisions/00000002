''8th July 2005 -- various patent lobby groups had invested many million euro in order to press a pro-patent directive text from the Council through the Parliament's second reading.  Early this week they found that this would not be possible and therefore asked "their"'' !MEPs ''to go for rejection of the "Common Position".  After some initial statements of dismay, the patent lobby groups were however quick to claim the Parliament's rejection vote as a victory.  Some even interpret it as a rejection of the 21 cross-partisan amendments.  Such reinterpretation of events is often referred to as "spin-doctoring".  The effort has to some extent been successful in influencing the reporting of major media.''

In fact nearly half of the tory MEPs were planning not to follow Harbour but to vote for these 21 amendments.  The Parliament had a certain majority for central amendments and high likelihood for many others.  Under this impression the patent lobby (EICTA, BSA) is rumored to have held a crisis meeting with "their" !MEPs on monday evening, asking them to go for rejection, something which the others had demanded all along for other reasons.
