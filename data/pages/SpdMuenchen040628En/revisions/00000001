After five speakers in favor, the resolution was adopted in a nearly unanimous vote (several dozens of yes, one abstention, one no) on 28 July 2004 at the annual caucus of the Munich social democrats. The German text below urges national !MPs, the national caucus, and the government to stick to the Parliament's, not to the Council's version.

 Motion to the ministry of Justice, the party caucus and the SPD !MPs:        
                                                                                
 The Munich SPD demands a clear vote against software patents from 
 the German Government and the MPs of the German Bundestag.               
 Especially the Bundestag shall clarify that the "directive
 on patentability of computer-implemented inventions"                 
 (KOM(2002)92 2002/0047 (COD)) in its of 18 May 2004 is directed    
 18. Mai 2004 against the most innovative parts of the German
 economy. Many software patents would be legalized and this would 
 make nearly the entire IT sector, and especially open source 
 initiatives patent violators. The German government and the 
 German MEPs are asked to back the European Parliament's version
 of the directive because it introduces clear limits to 
 the patentability of computer programs.
