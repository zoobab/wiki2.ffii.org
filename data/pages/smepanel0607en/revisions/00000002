''Bussels, 10 July 2006 - The FFII researched what was behind the SME Panel mentioned in the preliminary findings document published by the Commission last week. It appears that the Commission was not happy with the results of the consultation, and they decided to launch another one through the European Information Centres (EIC) with targeted'' !SMEs ''involved with the patent system.''

  Brussels, 24/04/2006
  
  Dear SME Panel coordinators,
  
  Please find below the information related to the first SME Panel to be organised.
  
  SUBJECT OF THE PANEL
  
  The first subject submitted to the panel of SMEs will be dealing with the patent systems and the
  intellectual property rights. The questionnaires and the background documents are attached to this
  e-mail.
  The subject of the panel was decided by the two units dealing with the issue: unit D2 in DG
  MARKT and unit D1 of DG ENTR.
  DG MARKT D2 launched some weeks ago an on-line consultation on patent systems (translation in
  German of this part of the questionnaire is available upon request). Nevertheless, taking into
  account the subject's complexity and the difficulties faced in obtaining answers directly from SMEs,
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  DG MARKT considered that the SME Panel tool would be very useful because it would support
  and complete the results already obtained in the on-line consultation. The objective behind this
  consultation is to study the possibility for further developing the patent system legal framework.
  DG ENTR D1 would like to explore the systems implemented at national level and to obtain
  examples of good practices, in order to evaluate the possibility of elaborating a series of practical
  recommendations to the Member States.
  
  TARGETED SMES
  
  The SMEs you should target with the questionnaire are:
    - Current patent holders
    - Those who hold a patentable invention but who, for a particular reason (please specify which),
      have not sought the patent (reasons: price/complicated rules/lack of information etc)
    - SME's who have been sued by patent holders for patent infringement
    - Any other SME's who have had to deal with the patent system (please specify the circumstances)
  
  OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
  
  The time allocated to the organisation of the panel is 6 weeks. The reports should be received by the
  Commission by the 5th June 2006.
  If you have any question concerning this panel, please contact Virginie Cossoul
  (virginie.cossoul@fcis.cec.eu.int Tel: +32 2 2871534).
  As explained in the point 3.4 of the call for proposals, the deliverables you must issue are two:
    1. A report elaborated by each participating EIC, summarising the replies collected from the
       SMEs. There will be as many as participating EICs.
    2. A national report, elaborated by the coordinator, summarising the EIC reports received.

This document presents the EPO and is rather scathing about its attempts to involve itself in policy work. A small extract:

  "Whilst being basically a patent granting office, the EPO has ambitions to steer patent
  policy at European and international levels."
