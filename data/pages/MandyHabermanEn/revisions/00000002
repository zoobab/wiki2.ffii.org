A technically savvy woman from the UK who "invented the highly successful Anywayup Cup" (!CfC) and extracted revenues from it through an even more successful patent.  Various patent lobby organs have been touting the Mandy Haberman success story.  Mandy has not always been happy about what was said.  In November 2002 she wrote a letter to the European Parliament in which she distances herself from efforts by UNICE to use her example as an argument in favor of software patents.

== Mandy Haberman on the Web ==

She was at least interviewed by the BBC4 radio (together with John Mitchell from [[http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/allvoice/|Allvoice]]): http://web.archive.org/web/20030219120445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/features/patents.shtml/

Also UKPO cited her in its reply. She is presented as a model inventor.
