''Mr Brinkhorst will be in the Tweede Kamer on Tuesday to answer open questions on what happened in the Council the day before. His speech was cut from the public deliberation.''

== List of questions to Mr Brinkhorst ==

 * Is there an audio recording of what you said yesterday? The Public deliberation audio recordings were specially cut when you took the speech.
 * Do you have supported the B-item move from DK, PL, PT? If yes, is it in the Council minutes somewhere?
 * Can you point out in the Council Rules of Procedure which rule regulates the fact that a political agreement cannot be reopened for discussions?
 * If you cannot find the proper article, do you think the Luxembourg presidency has misguided Denmark in saying that a B-item was not possible for procedural reasons?
 * How many countries were needed to have a B-item?
 * A French Diplomat said that the Presidency maybe made a mistake in rejecting the B-item request?
 * Do you know if the Presidency has asked each country to take position on the B-item request from those 3 countries? What was the official NL answer to the Presidency when they asked you if you were against or for the denial of the B-item request? What was the exact question asked by the Luxembourg Presidency?
 * etc...
