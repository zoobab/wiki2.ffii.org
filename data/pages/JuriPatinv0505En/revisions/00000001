206 is ok overall, except that it would have been better if it had talked about "inventions realised with the help of computer programs", as a computer program itself cannot realise an invention.

207 is not really an improvement over the Council version, as it still talks about inventions as if there can be inventions without technical character.

9=208 suffers from the same problem as 207.

209=210  (=211 minus some translation differences) clearly states that when there is no technical character (or if the technical character is not yet established), one should not talk about inventions but about innovations (innovation does not have a special meaning in European patent law, invention is however a synonym for "statutory or patentable subject matter"). 9 adds some extra references to the other conditions of patentability, but is otherwise equivalent.
