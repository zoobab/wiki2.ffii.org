= Flash video based on IE-DK dialogue at the Council Meeting of 18 May =

This is a work area for people who may help make this video. We currently only have a script and a soundtrack; we need photographs and someone to make the flash video.

== Photographs ==

If you know of any useful photographs that are redistributable, and could be incorporated in the video, please insert links right below this paragraph. We need a photograph of Bolkestein, of demos, of frowning politicians, of amendments, of MEPs, or whatever.

== The script ==

Please note that I'm no director and no graphics artist. In scene 4 below I'm proposing certain tricks with fonts and colours, but until I really see it I don't know if it will look right. So feel free to change things if you think that I suck. Anyway, that's just a script; directors/implementers normally ignore/change whatever they like :-)

    We start in silence, and the text fades in.

One day, the European Commission made a proposal that concerned Europe's
technological future.

    Fade out.

=== 2 ===

    The following three sentences fade in one after the other, one below
    the other. At the same time, a picture shows each time a sentence
    appears (maybe partially hiding the previous picture). Bolkestein
    for the first sentence, some other politician - ideas? - for the
    second, a demo picture (or a composite from demo + paperwork +
    amendments) for the third.

Some said it was nice.

Others claimed it would be catastrophic.

There was upheaval all around Europe.

    Fade out.

=== 3 ===

So the Council considered the issue very, very carefully,

discussed in great depth,

and made very, very thoughtful decisions.

    Fade out.

=== 4 ===

    The IE-DK dialogue from the council starts to play
    (http://www.itia.ntua.gr/~anthony/tmp/soundtrack.ogg). The dialogue
    is also echoed on the screen. Initially, both Ireland and Denmark
    are in blue, and each part of the dialogue appears in fast fade-in
    (like the Windows Start menu :-).

''Irish Chairman:'' Belgium: abstain.

And Denmark? Can I hear from Denmark please?

''Denmark:'' I would really like to ask the commission why they couldn't accept the last sentence put forward by the Italians, which was in the original German proposal.

    Ireland's response is now not blue, but something between blue and
    red, still in normal typeface.

''Ireland:'' I think the Commissioner already answered that question, I'm sorry Denmark. So are you "yes", "no", "abstain"?

    Denmark's still blue, but is now slightly smaller.

''Denmark:'' I think we wouldn't, we're not hap...

    Ireland is now red, bold, and appears sharply, no fade-in at all.
    For the rest of the dialogue, Ireland always appears this way;
    Denmark remains blue fade-in, but each time it is smaller, until in
    her final phrase it is about half the size of Ireland.

''Ireland:'' '''I assume you're a "yes".'''

''Denmark:'' We're not happy.

''Ireland:'' '''Are you 80% happy?'''

''Denmark:'' But... I think we...

''Ireland:'' '''We don't need you to be totally happy. None of us are totally happy.'''

''Denmark:'' Oh, I know that, I know that.

''Ireland:'' '''If we were, we wouldn't be here!'''

''Denmark:'' I think we're not very happy, but I think we would, we would...

''Ireland:'' '''Thank you very much.'''

''Denmark:'' ... we would like to see a solution today.

''Ireland:'' '''Thank you very much, Denmark.'''

'''Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm happy to say that we have a qualified majority, so thank you all very very much indeed, and thank you to commissioner Bolkestein.'''


=== 5 ===

Why was the Irish Chairman so eager to get Denmark's support?

=== 6 ===

    The following two sentences pop in order in black, which immediately
    fades out slowly to grey.

Get the facts.

Find the answers.

    After a short pause, the URL fades in. The colour is a difficult
    choice. Green's the obvious choice, but since the intended audience is
    someone who don't have a clue and who we try to make them click on
    the URL, and since the video so far has only presented a mystery,
    I'm afraid it might give the impression that we're simply some
    Greens with a vague cause. But this really depends on the country -
    for example, this might be risky in Greece, but not in that context.
