Due to "work-related accident" in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (as it appears neither organisations representing ICT industry or state IT policymakers were consulted) Estonian position for 18.05.2004 meeting was to support "Irish compromise".

Main coalition partners in Estonian government ([http://www.respublica.ee Res Publica] and [http://www.reform.ee Reformierakond]) are thus openly pro-"compromise" while third partner ([http://www.erl.ee/ Eestimaa Rahavaliit], known to oppose other two partners in some issues) has answered that patentability issue and amendments needed to make directive acceptable need further discussion, but they would definitely vote against current compromise draft and have promised to be "open for arguments".

With the exception of [http://www.keskerakond.ee Keskerakond] who has not answered any software patents related questions parties ([http://www.sotsdem.ee Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond], [http://www.isamaaliit.ee Isamaaliit], [http://www.esdtp.ee Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Tööpartei]) have either openly stated their position against software patents or (in case of ESDTP) been "open for arguments".
