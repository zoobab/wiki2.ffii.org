= Help Blast out this PR =

It has the highest potential impact of all PRs since last summer.

When sending to journalists, please also invite them to the [http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/bxl04/press/ Press Conference], for which moreover some [:Bxl44PressEn: specific work] remains to be done.

== Roles ==

 * Erik (erjos, ehj) is helping to instruct helpers on irc://irc.debian.org#bxl-ffii (freenode).
 * Hartmut and Holger can not help due to Brussels Conference.
 * arebenti at ffii org has to submit his diploma thesis in a few days but will do some things, including cutting out chunks of this PR and rewriting german versions for specific german news channels, see Cons040408FrainDe.
 * Alex Stohr has contacted some news channels, see below
 * James (jheald) has alterted some interested journalists particularly in the UK
 * Dieter will handle Flemish PR (and possibly Dutch as well), has produced a simplified dutch version.
 * Alexander Stohr will create a template of this page for use in later PRs at WikiPRTemplateEn

== Keeping in Touch ==

Use [http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/media-parl/ media-parl at ffii org] and irc://irc.debian.org/#bxl-ffii
together with this wiki page to aid coordination.

== Template for future press releases ==

alexander stohr at gmx de has generalised this wiki page to a form that makes it easier to recycle in the future.

Find the template of this page for use in similar pages at WikiPRTemplateEn.  

''phm: please never create any kwiki pages that do not end in a language suffix, move to WikiPRTemplateEn!'' (original place was: WikiPRTemplate)


== Translate ==

Translate the [http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons0408/cons040408.en.txl editable source text]
and send it to to mlhtimport at a2e de, see [http://swpat.ffii.org/group/langtxt/ translating instructions].

Note that the original changed on 2004-04-09 at around 16:00 in some places.

=== Hints to Translators ===

 * check EU institution/law terminology such as "directive", "presidency", "council", "amendment"
 * phrases like "no software patents -- power to the Parliament" were chosen under shortness constraints which vary from language to language, different ways of shortening a base meaning similar to "all lawmaking power to elected legislators" may have to be found in some languages.
 * names like "Call for Action" should be translated, but the original title should show up the first time it occurs in the body.
 * since several people may be translating at the same time, you should usually fetch the latest txl file from the net before translating, and send only those text chunks which you really modified, leaving the others behind hash marks (treated as comments, not inserted into the database)

=== Status of various Language Versions ===

see also that version's own addenda wiki

==== Finnish ====
 * Tapani has finished a Finnish version. see Cons040408Fi

==== German ====
 * alexander stohr at gmx de and dh at cantamen de say they have translated to german, a lot of problems are left, see also discussion on Cons040408De

==== Dutch ====
 * Discussion also in Dutch at Cons040408Nl
 * Reinout van Schouwen (reinout at cs DOT vu.nl) is working on it
 * Dieter Van Uytvanck as well (begin- #qjd)
 * Pieter Pax09 as well, beginning on part #Wew

==== Portoguese ====
 * Rui Miguel Seabra published it on http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons0408/index.pt.html, still needs some revision, mostly for spelling mistakes due to fast typing.
 * Discussion in Portugues at Cons040408Pt

=== Spanish ===

 * Erik Josefsson got a spanish version trough IRC and now asked for a spanish translator trough traduk ML, supposed he wants to verify the text. see Cons040408Es.  We need the address and uid of this spanish translator.  Translation is quite imperfect, needs proofreading by Jesus or Xavier.

Other languages are going silently online, please see web page.
