''European Software Association is a lobbying body set up in late October 2005. It might be a response to unsuccessful lobbying carried out in the past by SAP and Microsoft related to extend the enforcability of certain patents in which Mircosoft currently invests huge resources and started to file at high rates at the EPO. The new body apparently stresses being European, despite Microsoft being a direct and unhidden member. Although the ESA claims to represent European Software companies, its membership mainly comprises European business partners and software vendors of its apparent US initiator Microsoft. According to an Euraktiv article the lobbying organisation was 'set up' by Jes√∫s Villasante from the European Commission. ESA and BSA lobbyist Eilert Hanoa announced ESA 'aims to help Commissioner Reding and her colleagues examine initiatives from unexplored angles and offer recommendations and counsel'. Villasante is Head of Unit for Software Technologies under Commissioner Reding (DG Infosoc)''

Other lobbying bodies used in the past were ACT, BSA, !CompTIA/"Initiative for Software Choice" and "Campaign For Creativity". [[http://www.itworld.com/Man/3827/051020euvendorgroup/|ESA lobbyists very early denied to represent a puppet of Microsoft]], which looks strange. Especially the '''French Government is targeted''' in the launch phase of the European Software Association campaign. Quote [[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/19/business/soft.php|IHT 2005-10-19]] (A press release was also sent out in [[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20051020005549&newsLang=fr|French language]]):
 ...Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft - is to appear in 
 Paris as a guest of the French Ministry of Industry to 
 support moves to bolster the French software sector. 
 Developers like Staff&Line, which produces software for
 information technology management in Noisy-le-Grand,
 near Paris, are to announce their own French-oriented(!)
 software interest group in Paris ...

It is worth to mention that Microsoft's EU lobbying infrastructure also includes [[TechCentralStationEn| TechCentralStation]], a journo-lobbying body of the Washington DCI group which promotes hate speech against the [[http://www.google.com/custom?q=TCS+France&sitesearch=techcentralstation.com|French nation]], its Government, [[http://www.techcentralstation.com/082803M.html|muslim minority policy in France]], [[http://techcentralstation.com/082603A.html|muslims in general]], all sorts of alleged 'socialists' and runs an [[http://www.techcentralstation.com/supersizecon.html|ad hominem campaign against an independent US film maker]] etc. etc. 
TCS journo-lobbyist Sylvain Charat [[http://www.techcentralstation.com/040705C.html|addressed France as a Little USSR]]
 Just like big cities often have their own peculiar neighborhoods -- Little Italy, Chinatown, 
 Greek Town, etc. -- the EU has its own Little USSR. It's called France.

The same group also launched an [[http://www.techcentralstation.com/070505Q.html|weird and inappropriate opinion article against FFII "No to Info-Communism"]]. 
 The group is waging an ideological continuation of 
 Karl Marx's crusade against capitalism and private 
 property. ... The people who run FFII are enemies 
 of private property, the free-market and capitalism. 
 ... Why should Europeans let the FFII create a world 
 in which innovators are exploited by pirates and 
 plagiarizers? Rather, we should give Hartmut Pilch, 
 the FFII president, the same advice as George Bush
  gave to Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11: "Go get a real job!"

In rhetorics and style ESA is more likely to step in !CompTIA's footsteps with special emphasis on representing 'European' SME stakeholders. Earlier this summer Microsoft !CompTIA's spinoff C4C [[http://europeansoftwarepatents.blogspot.com/2005/09/future-phase-ii-consultation-open-now.html|started a discussion process]] about their [[http://europeansoftwarepatents.blogspot.com/2005/08/youre-invited.html|'success' and the creation of new bodies]].

 For instance do we need a campaign at all, or something 
 completely different? ...
 We would also be interested in other aspects ... that 
 you think need further work. For instance, is there 
 sufficient data of good quality to support our arguments?

European Software Association lobbyist Eilert Hanoa (also BSA Norway) wants to provide 
such intelligence to the Commissioners:
 The European Software Association aims to help Commissioner 
 Reding and her colleagues examine initiatives from unexplored 
 angles and offer recommendations and counsel for efficient 
 application of Directives. Basically, our aim is to ensure 
 that the industry is properly represented before policy makers 
 by providing them with the information they need to deliver 
 effective legislation for the benefit of European industry 
 and commerce as a whole.

MS lobbyist [[JonathanZuckEn| Jonathan Zuck (ACT)]] explained earlier in an [[http://www.techcentralstation.com/021805A.html|TechCentralStation Interview]]:
 I think part of the process for Microsoft is just going
 to be continue to be engaged. You know, and continuing to 
 grow the European operation and, as they become more and 
 more of multinational, European governments will have to 
 deal with them as a European company as opposed to an American 
 one. ... I think as it becomes a more global corporation,
 then there's more of an understanding that what's good for
 Microsoft is good for Europe.

The domain was registered by mamut.

ESA and BSA lobbyist Eilert Hanoa is CEO of Mamut, a Microsoft ISV.

Mamut & Microsoft gets 180k google hits.
E.g. [[http://www.microsoft.com/emea/pressCentre/PressRelease2004.aspx?f=MamutMSPR_070604|European Small Business Concierge Offering From Mamut and Microsoft]] 
"Mamut and Microsoft have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to extend their partnership alliance and jointly liaise with value-added resellers to deliver Small Business Concierge."

=== Quotes from the campaigners ===

==== One Campaigner ====
 "Both sides [[of |the swpat debate]] were claiming (sic!) small and medium enterprises as their supporters," 
 "This is a way for independent software vendors (sic!) to speak for themselves," 
 "Economically, it's not a business that is currently represented at the European level."
"One Lobbyist" according to [[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/19/business/soft.php|International Herald Tribune]].

Note: "Independent" Software '''Vendors''' are companies who '''sell''' software from a software manufacturer. Apparently Microsoft wants to use its European ISV as a lobbying astroturf campaign. 

==== Roche (ESA) ====
 It's unfair to say that the European Software Association (ESA) is a Trojan horse for Microsoft.
[[http://www.itworld.com/Man/3827/051020euvendorgroup/|Roche according to IDG]]

Note: Roche proactively responds to criticism.

==== Microsoft about their ESA campaign ====
 Microsoft believes that software development is a traditionally under-represented
 sector of the industry and ESA is a constructive and inclusive means of engaging 
 with policy-makers on relevant issues

[[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/20/eu_software_lobby/|Microsoft according to The Register]]

Note: A diplomatic description of Astroturfing.

==== Press release of the campaign: Greenhorns ====
 Eilert Hanoa, vice-chairman, said: "The European Software Association aims 
 to help Commissioner Reding and her colleagues examine initiatives from  
 unexplored angles and offer recommendations and counsel for efficient 
 application of Directives. Basically, our aim is to ensure that the industry 
 is properly represented before policy makers by providing them with the
 information they need to deliver effective legislation for the benefit of 
 European industry and commerce as a whole."

Note: Reding might be considered a weak Commissioner but this Pr statement reveals inappropriate hubris. Probably these lobbyists misinterpret their role. 

==== Roche in Euractiv ====

 ESA sets out to speak for the whole of the software industry based 
 in Europe or with major European subsidiaries. One purpose of the 
 association, according to Mr. Roche, will be to challenge US
 dominance in various sectors of the software market, "in particular
 desktop software".
[[http://www.euractiv.com/Article?tcmuri=tcm:29-146116-16&type=News|Source Euraktiv]]

Note: This is the new Microsoft strategy which blames lobbying failure to national market preferences. ESA is no credible body for achieving this goal, it is an astroturf. Intrestingly the article mentions others of those failed MS lobbying bodies. Further national rhetorics and software procurement strategies are a step back to market protection.

 Another main purpose will be to give (in particular) small and medium-sized companies better 
 access to venture capital. ... For this reason, Mr. Roche said, ESA will try to be a 'virtual Silicon Valley' for Europe. 

Note: Better access to venture capital' here means lobbying for software patenting. 

 DG Information Society Head of Unit for Software Technologies Jes√∫s Villasante,
 who played an important role in setting up the new association

Note: This needs to be questioned in EU-Parliament, because it exceeds the competence of Commission staff to set up lobbying associations.

== Related association in France ==

Meanwhile, another association of software vendors has been launched in France: Afdel (Association fran√ßaise des √©diteurs de logiciels). Of course Microsoft is included in its founding members. Afdel's spokesman is Jamel Labed, who was a former spokesman for BSA. 

Whois record for afdel.org, collected on [[http://www.couchet.org/blog/index.php?2005/10/21/80-l-afdel-nouveau-cheval-de-troie-de-microsoft|Mad's Blog]], shows very interesting informations: afdel.org domain name was directly registered by Microsoft and technical contact is [[http://kolter.free.fr/insolite/avocats_bsa.png|a lawyer working for a law film who has BSA as customer]].
