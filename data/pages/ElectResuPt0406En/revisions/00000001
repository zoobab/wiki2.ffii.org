= Analysis: =

NOTE: good means a good vote (or intent of vote), bad means a bad vote and unknown means position is not yet clear, regarding the September 24th, 2003 vote on Software Patents. There's no character evaluation involved :)

'''BE''' has elected one (good) MEP: Miguel Portas. BE is as opposed to software patents as CDU and PP.

'''CDU (PCP+Greens)''' has maintained the number of MEPs, the same (both good) MEPs continue: Ilda Figueiredo and Sergio Ribeiro

'''PS''' maintained number of MEPs. Elected were: António Costa (unknown), Ana Gomes (unknown), Francisco Assis (unknown), Elisa Ferreira (unknown), Paulo Casaca (good), Sérgio Sousa Pinto (bad), Fausto Correia (unknown), Edite Estrela (unknown), Capoulas Santos (unknown), Jamila Madeira (unknown), Emanuel Jardim Fernandes (unknown) and Manuel dos Santos (bad).

'''PSD''' lost two MEPs. Elected were: João de Deus Pinheiro (unknown), Vasco Graça Moura (good), Assunção Esteves (unknown), José Silva Peneda (unknown), Sérgio Marques (unknown), Duarte Freitas (unknown), Carlos Coelho (good).

'''PP''' (in coalition with PSD) maintained the (both good) MEPs Luís Queiró and Ribeiro e Castro.

= OVERALL =

PSD lost profoundly. With one less MEP over all and BE electing one MEP, this means a bigger stroke than just loosing two MEPs. Considering we lost one MEP in the reshuflle, at first sight the software patent critical side may have been reinforced, particularly if both PP MEPs were reelected.

Since PS lost Maria Carrilho and António Campos, there is lots of work to do here, since PS voted quite badly on the software patents vote of setember 24, 2003. '''However, with the support from José Magalhães, PS MP in national parliament, to the urgent appeal''' for consillium vote reversal, maybe the scenery will change positively.

BE didn't have any MEP before, but their position is clearly against software patents.

= CONCLUSION =

||  || *1999 good* || *1999 bad* || *1999 unknown* || *2004 good* || *2004 bad* || *2004 unknown* ||
|| *BE* || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 ||
|| *CDU* || 2 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 0 ||
|| *PS* || 3 || 8 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 9 ||
|| *PSD* || 5 || 3 || 1 || 2 || 0 || 5 ||
|| *PP* || 2 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 0 ||
|| *TOTAL* || *12* || *11* || *2* || *8* || *2* || *14* ||

Number of good MEPs dropped by 4

Number of bad MEPs dropped by 9

Number of unknown MEPs increased by 12

To be sure, lots of those 14 unknown positions should be brought over to our side. If we can do that, we can see our position reinforced. Loosing a few MEPs but incresing largely the number of unknown positions means there's a lot of work ahead of us.
