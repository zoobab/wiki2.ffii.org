At least current versions of [[http://xinehq.de/|Xine]], [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu|mplayer]] and [[http://www.videolan.org|Videolan Client]] should be able to play both high quality formats under Linux (thanks to ffmpeg and libavc). No binary Windows/x86 codecs are required. Older versions of mplayer, or sometimes also recent ones marked as "unencumbered" by your distribution, may only be able to play the Windows Media version (and the lower quality mpeg1 version).

If you are concerned about how software patents will affect you and your business, it's very important that you talk to your representatives in the European Parliament:
 * Always be polite, never get aggressive, don't use form letters, explain how software patents would affect ''you''.
 * To see what FFII is pushing for in the second reading of the European Parliament, have a look at the [[http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/ep2r/ffiiltr050328en.pdf|letter]] we sent to the MEPS, as well as the [[http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/ep2r/ffiiapp050328en.pdf|appendices]]. More information (such as amendments) are [[Plen05En| also available]].
 * Wikipedia has a very helpful list of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_European_Parliament_2004-2009|MEPs by Country and Region]]
