''Currently the FFII is registered in Munich.  There are some good reasons for moving FFII to other places, such as Brussels or Stockholm.  We collect reasons and spell out steps that would have to be taken to perform such a transfer or to make FFII less dependent on any location.'' 

== Legal environment ==

 * Need to know how friendly Belgium is to Internet publishers.  Germany is extremely internet-unfriendly ground, with "flying court location" etc.
   * In places like SE, NO a german court order for libel on a case that mainly concerns Germany is immediately executed by the local court.  

== Candidates apart from Munich ==

 * Brussels -- close to EU
 * Luxemburg -- only one court location; close to EU, DE, FR 
 * Geneva/Lausanne -- close to WIPO, possibly better legal environment 


== Things to Do ==

=== Bank accounts ===

 * open a separate bank account that has a Brussels counter and some money for use in Brussels on it

=== Answering mail and phone ===

 * E-Mail addresses such as brussels at ffii org, europarl at ffii org as well as the office phone number +32 (0) 27 39 62 62 still seem to be attended irregularly. 
   * There is no answering machine, no redirection to Strasburg.  One attractive solution could be a decentral VoIP-based solution, e.g. using Skype, Google Talk.
