The "message" in the static page was not actually delivered.  This must be updated.

Also the messages of some of the participants were mentioned in some other pages but not in this one.  The notes must be written down.

E.g. Prof. Desantes from EPO said: "If, as  evidence presented at this conference suggests, software patents are not contributing to innovation and economic growth in Europe, the EPO is willing to stop granting them, regardless of any discussions on technical effects, which lead nowhere." 

A volume of OECD will be published, in which the article [http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/trivial/index.en.html Why are software patents so trivial?] will be published as the contribution from Hartmut Pilch of FFII & Eurolinux.
