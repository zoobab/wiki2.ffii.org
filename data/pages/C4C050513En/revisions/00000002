''Friday, 13th, Campaign for Creativity launched a bizarre attack against the FFII. The campaign reaches a new quality by choosing a new, very undiplomatic tone. JURI-Rapporteur Michel Rocard (PSE) was slandered as a 'handmaiden' of FFII. Campaign for Creativity is a professional campaign, which depicts itself as a grassroot campaign of creative practioners. The PR-Professional show certain concern over the patentability of washing maschines, ABS systems and other penny dreadfuls (but no insuline tubes yet).''

== C4C-Contribution "Lies and Deceptions from the FFII"  ==

== Information ==
From a content perspective only the terminology of C4C is somewhat insightful:  

 We are ALL against software patents because a software patent is 
 an impossibility. Software is code. You cant patent it anymore 
 than you can patent the text in a book.

These are not those Software patents, which are a pain for developers. This is not the understanding of FFII. Precisely this particular understanding of C4c of the phrase software patent is totally absurd, because no one is intrested in such patent protection, which additionally protects the object under copyright - for a shorter period of time and under higher fees. It sounds riddiculous, and therefore no one follows this semantics, unless he has a certain intentions. 

The software patents that FFII and its many supporters do not want beeing codified by EU directive or other law are the patents that do stop selling or otherwise spreading peoples very own and originally written code in source or binary form and further banning its legal execution on anyones machine because it resembles some amount of software design and data processing ideas. As the average application program does involve several hundreds to hundredthousands of ideas,
solutions and other microscopic inventive steps there is no practicable way for ensuring that a specific software is ever free of software patents from third partys. Only binding software to a purpose and a physical effect that is used in an inventive manner can resolve the situation. Only this way that will prevent serious harm (up to a stand still) for most market participants that do spend money on their very own development department. The innovative process must not be endangered and software development must remain an open business.

 If the FFII really only wanted to prevent software patents, 
 they [..] would support the Council of Ministers position,
 which explicitly rules out patents on software, 

Such "C4C-Software patents" are probably excluded by the Bolkestein-Insert in the context of the Council text (but nothing else)
 Articke 4.1 A computer program as such cannot contitute a patentable invention.


And even this exclusion only holds when code does not get executed. Further a computer programm can be claimes according to Article 5.2. It suggest what complicated interpretation is ahead of case law because of the Article 4.1.

According to the European Patent Convention, "Programmes for computers" [[AssuchEn| as such]] are no inventions and thus not patetentable. Via the Bolkestein-insert Article 4.1 in fact '''no limiting effect''' takes place, as the non-patentable software is redefined as something like the "C4C-software patent". Further article 4 codified the EPO teaching of the further technical effect, which the EPO developed in exspectation of a planned deletion of EPC 52.2.

Perhaps here the [[http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/gui_lines/e/c_iv_2_3_6.htm|definition of the term computer-implemented inventions according to EPO-examination guidelines is somewhat helpful]]:
 2.3.6 Programs for computers
 Programs for computers are a form of "computer-implemented invention",
 an expression intended to cover claims which involve computers, computer
 networks or other conventional programmable apparatus whereby prima facie
 the novel features of the claimed invention are realised by means of a 
 program or programs. 

Almost quoted you find it in the [[http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st11/st11979-re01.en04.pdf|Council directive proposal]].
 Artikel 2 a: "computer-implemented invention" means
 any invention the performance of which involves the use 
 of a computer, computer network or other programmable 
 apparatus, the invention having one or more features which 
 are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer
 program or computer programs;

Again, note what EPO-examination guidelines explain:
 Programs for computers are a form of "computer-implemented invention",

== Literature patents? No, Patents for book-implemented inventions ==

Related to the example of the C4C as found above we might suggest a mind game. The idea of patents for book-implemented inventions. In this debate there were no literature patents, because '''no one intended to patent the text of a book'''. But ideas of literature such as (Female protagonist, characterised by...)  would be  available as book-implemented inventions for patent protection. For legal certainty and harmonisation (some courts still stick to odd rules) in the European single market, the Commissionn would propose a directive for the patentability of book-implemented inventions. Oppenents of literature patents would likely have to deal with lobbyists and Commissioners who tell the MEPs, book-implemented inventions comprised book binding  methods, Print maschines and typographs. And an association of the print industry would lobby against the "abolishment of patent protection for book-implemented inventions" and rally against the first reading results. As read in the news: "Literature patents - Print industry is afraid of their inventions".
