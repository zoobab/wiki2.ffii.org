Purpose: Testbed for new software

== What (the hell) is verfaction?  ==

 * Verfaction is a private initiative of Kilian Krause.
 * He has set up an UML instance for us on his private server which he is using for this initiative: http://verfaction.de 
 * we can assign a new alias to the host, e.g. test.ffii.org

== Resources on the machine ==

 * DNS names: verfaction.ffii.org,  eos.verfaction.de, ffii.verfaction.de - IP Address: 212.9.177.17
 * The root filesystem is 2 GB in size (can be increased if neccesary)
 * a separate filesystem could be created for the UML instance and added to the UML instance.
 * SQL and SMTP of hosting system of the UML instance can be used
 * people which might have access so far: phm at ffii org, aigarius at debian org, nico-erichsen at hsh-berlin com
 * machine owner and admin of the host system of the UML instance: Kilian Krause 0179 6951439 (kk at verfaction de)
 * the machine is not used at the moment, free to do anything as long as Kilian Krause is ok with it (doesn't overload his server, as the UML is one process, he can easily renice it as a whole too)
