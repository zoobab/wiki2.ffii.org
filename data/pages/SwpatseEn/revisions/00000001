Sweden has had a double standard for granting patents based on the EPO and the EPC line, that is 'technical'-praxis and legal 'invention'. PRV have a slightly higher standard than EPO, a problem for PRV since they then get to process less patent applications. 

PRV have been given orders to follow EPO praxis in terms of granting. Managers within PRV have taken key EU initiative for the CII-directive with the swedish justice ministry. 

They also put a stop to three separate parliament motions to ban software patents with reference to 'the ongoing debate in EU'. This is a highly questionable action due to the bias and hard work within EU by the justice department at the same time.
