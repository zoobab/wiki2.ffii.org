In response to a [[http://swpat.ffii.org/journal/04/medef0705/index.fr.html|FFII-FR Press Release]], that was reacting to a pro-patent manifest from [[SwpatmedefFr| Medef]] (Union of French !CEOs), Maxime Gremetz (Communist MP) has filed a written question to the French Minister of Economy:

  Mr. Maxime Gremetz asks Mr, Minister of State, Minister of Economy, Finance
  and Industry about the Proposal for an European Directive on Software Patents.
  Despite the danger that Software Patents represent on European software
  industry, French delegation has voted, on May 18th 2004 in the Council of
  European Union, in the way expected by patents experts of big companies. If
  it happened to reveive formal approval, this agreement would lead Europe
  under the control of US companies. He ask him if he is ready to accept,
  as it was done in Neederlands, a parlementary debate in order to keep safe
  independance of European software industry.
