== Purpose of this Project ==

Work out 
[[http://showroom.nexedi.org:81/ffii.org|prototype]]
and specifications for the new FFII portal, implement.

These will be further elaborated and implemented by [[http://www.nexedi.com/|Nexedi.com]] using [[http://zope.org/Members/nuxeo/Products/CPS3|CPS3]] starting 
during July 1-31 (four working weeks of an
apprentice/stagiaire).

== Content Structure ==

 * 5 main sections, one manager for each
 * to be specified in detail on the page itself

== Requirements ==

 * scope of content
   * the portal is oriented primarily toward the EU, could be called eu.ffii.org at first, perhaps www.ffii.org later
     * renaming to www.ffii.org could be done by means of apache rewrite rules that gradually overwrite the existing www.ffii.org namespace
   * we can not expect all ffii.org site content to move to this portal.  Instead we can try to make it easy for other sites to integrate themselves with this site
   * all pages of this portal must be perfect and current all the time.  There needs to be a limited and highly motivated group of maintainers, some perhaps paid.  Elaborate access managment (as possible under Zope & Co) is desirable.
   * example of sites that with limited but focussed content are
     * http://www.patentverein.de/
     * http://www.esr-pollmeier.de/swpat/
     * http://www.eu04.com/
 * variants, multilinguality
   * documents have variants, based on language and other parameters (one of the strong points of CPS3)
 * interoperation through database
   * the portal has access to the central ffii database and other databases which are currently on genba.ffii.org under postgresql with local port 5432 (accessible via ssh)
   * documents have identifiers, !URLs are calculated from these identifiers based on data provided in central ffii database tables dokprop et al, based on a document name rule language such as found in http://swpat.ffii.org/papri/europarl0309/nodes.txt.
   * some documents may be connected to kwiki pages which can be read from ffii database table wikipag
 * interoperation through CSS
   * we try to use a common set of naming for blocks between the portal and the swpat.ffii.org site 
   * we try to confine layout specification to CSS files which can be used by other ffii.org sites. This includes documentation of the current CSS tags used.
 * interoperation on News, content syndication
   * our current newsticker is http://kwiki.ffii.org/SwpatcninoEn and it will continue to be like this.
   * We can try to share news items by creating a form in [[AktivEn| Aktiv]] or elsewhere which produces a news item both on kwiki and on the new portal and through RSS (so as to facilitate sharing by other sites)
