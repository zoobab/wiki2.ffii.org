I beg you pardon. Predident, commissioner, collegues, I would like to point out on ??? collegues
that during the negotionations, we have found a majority agreeing on wanting patentability of
computer implemented inventions, and the strength of our companies depands on that. What is the
situation now, is that there are companies that want to have patents in this area and they can't do
it in fact. And the comissioner  has just pleaded in favor of more harmonization at the European
level. And what we want to avoid as well, and I think also here collegues a agree, I think that we
do not want to see an american development on patentability, so that we see that software is
patented as software, but what we want to put in very plane language is software to hardware, but
there is really a difficulty in getting straight-forward language for describing  it because, I'd
like to put this to the commision: We have soo many proposals, but how can we do this for example
on the amendments for tomorrow, we are talking the amendments which have been tabled with respect
to  interoperability. We  have the Rocard amendments, and we have also amendments from other
collegues. We have Paia Noora Kaupii's amendment and we have my amendment, and I would like to ask
the comission what its possition is on all  these various amendments. Particluarily in respect to
forced licenses, or the limitation exclusion when we are talking about software to software.
Comissioner, maybe you would be kind enought to give an opinition on that. Thank you.

President. Parliament faces a grate strategic challege to create a regulatory
framework that will stop the spread of patentability of software. Tactically ,our
first task tomorrow must be to defeat the simplistic proposals to reject the
second reading. We must ensure that we are able to progress steadily to amend
the common position. It is simply through the conciliation procedure that a
first class piece of a law will be created. To fail to legislate at all, would leave
the industry to the old mercy of the EPO, the courts and the panels of the World
Trade Organisation. I'm afraid that that would be a costly, legalistic and consufing
situation. Thank you.


=  First talk of Commissioner Amunia, 2005-07-05 =
''Spoken in english''

Thank you mr. president. First of all I want to inform the parliament that
commissioner !McCreevy was not able to be present today, so I will represent 
the
commission in this debate. I would like to start by thanking Michael Rocard, 
the
rapporteur on this complex and technical file, for the hard work he has put 
into this
dossier. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, who have also 
made major
contributions to the work of the parliament on this issue. This proposal is 
not only
relveant to inventions implemented on a standard computer, a laptop for 
example. It
covers many every-day consumer goods and devices, increasingly important in 
our daily
life, such as cars, washing machines, mobile phones, cameras, DVD players, 
tv sets,
vacuum cleaners, or medical equipment like scanners.

The proposal does not aim to abolish the current practice of the
European Patent Office, nor to extend it to cover the patenting of
pure computer programs as many of the opponents of the proposal have
claimed. Indeed, they have equally and mistakenly claimed that the
directive is introducing the notion of patentability of software
inventions in EU patent practice for the first time. The proposed text
clearly excludes patents for pure software, as well as business
methods, as such. Only technical innovations embodied in a computer
program and meeting the patentability criteria of novelty,
inventiveness and industrial applicability can be patented.

A legal framework ensuring patent protection in this area is key to
enable European industries, including small and medium enterprises to
be competitive in a high tech enviroment. Patents can guarantee a
return on (??) investments, attract venture capital and provide
bargaining power. This has a spin-off effect, which boosts
innovation. The commission believes that the common position meets the
requirements of introducing a predictable legal framework that
promotes and rewards innovation.

Amnendments seeking rejection of the common position have been
tabled. I would like to point out that this would only increase legal
uncertainty with respect to the inventions in question. Lack of
harmonization in this field would (predjudice?) the competetiveness of
the European undertakings, and continue to be an obstacle to the
smooth functioning of the internal market. In this spirit, the
commission continues to support the line taken in the common
position. Of course, we can accept amendments which introduce useful
technical or contextual clarifications, subject to minor fine-tuning
or interpretative statements where necessary, but the overall balance
of the proposal must be maintained.

The current definition of technical contribution in the directive is
taken from existing case law, so while it might be possible to word it
more elegantly, we cannot turn it around. Instead it seems more useful
to focus on the scope of patentable subject matter in article 4,
bringing the exclusions out more clearly.  Changing them in
contradiction with the European Patent Convention, would however
simply cause confusion. In addition, interoperability concerns can be
addressed by allowing access where possible to necessary technologies,
while protecting legitimate rights of inventors.

The report prepared by the legal affairs committee generally maintains
the balanced approach of the commissions proposal. Nonetheless, there
are some changes which should be made to bring the definitions and
criteria into line with general patent law. The commission can accept
additional reporting requirements, including the establishment of new
advisory committees, providing that the resource implications are ???
??? by the parliament. The commission cannot accept amendments which
relate to the commisions right of initiative or the relationship with
non-community institutions.

On key issues of substance, the commission is strongly committed to
promotion of interoperability as a means of fostering innovation and
competition, and to ensure that community legislatition does not act
as a hindrance to different software development models, proprietary
or open source. It therefore maintains certain flexibility as to the
solution found to deal with interoperability, provided that our
international obligations are respected.

On the scope of patentability, further clarification of the common
position is accpetable, but not significant changes departing from the
current situation, or from general patent law solutions. I should
signal here that we see particular drafting problems with certain
amendments relating to technical contribution and inventive step.

On claims to computer programs on a carrier, (where exact?) a program
implement a patented invention, the commission can accept any position
between the common position and the commissions original proposal,
including alternative formulations to archive the same objective of
enforcing valid patents.

The commission has noted the high number of amendments tabled on top
of the legal affairs committees report. I will set out the commissions
overall position on all amendments at the end of this mornings
discussion. 

Thank you very much mr. president.


=  Second talk of Commissioner Amunia, 2005-07-05 =

''Spoken in english''

Thank you Mr. president.

Those of you who have been directly involved in working on this
proposal know that we are dealing with a very complex area. The
directive cannot be turned on its head. What we need is a proper
balance between stimulating innovation and making sure competition is
not stifled. As commissioner !McCreevy said in his statement of last
march 2005, the ball is in your court. Whatever you decide, the
commission will take account of it and respect it.  Should you decide
to reject the common position, the commission will not submit a new
proposal. Also, you should remember that rejection would stand in the
way of many European undertakings, and go against our common Lisbon
objectives of increasing Europes competiaviveness.

President, various members have raised during the debate the question
of interoperability. On this issue, the commission maintains a certain
degree of flexibility.  Compulsory licensing ??? are already present
in members states legislation. It is a suitable solution, provided
that no discrimination between different software development models,
proprietary or open source, is ensured. Companies should be motivated
to license voluntarily. However, if rights holders abuse the rights by
imposing unresonable conditions, authority should step in to ensure
fair terms are applied. Limited interoperability exception, geared
towards the promotion of open standards could also constiture a sound
approach, provided that international obligations are respected.

Various members have also raised copyright. Let me clarify that
copyright is a spearate and different right from patents. Copyright
and patents protect different aspects of something which is new and
original. So patents do not affect the existence of copyright.
Copyright protects the expression of an idea, but it does not protect
any invention.  And copyright protection does not prevent someone
taking an invention and expresing it in a different way.

With regard to small and medium size businesses, and their access to
the patent system, I should signal two aspects. First, members will be
aware of the commissions proposals for a community patent, which would
reduce costs for patent protection across the whole of the European
Union. And secondly, we have had a feasibility study done on the
question of insurance against the costs of patent litigation. This
study is now in the second phase, and consultants have been asked to
come up with concrete proposals.

President, in view of the high number of amendments tabled we are
providing the secretariat with an overview of the commissions position
of them, in writing, for inclution in the minutes of this debate. And
finally, president, I hope that the vote will result in a positive
outcome. However, should further ??? be necessary for finding an
agreement with the council, the commission stands ready to assist both
??? legislators towards reaching a constructive outcome.

== Comments on Lehne speech ==

Gérald Sédrati-Dinet, FFII's vice-president comments Lehne's assertions:

  Mr. Lehne seems to refute other opinions, expressed for eg. by Nigel Stoate,
  who is a colleague of Lehne as Taylor Wessing's partner, which comfirm what
  many Members States and national Parliaments have alreay proved: Council's
  text will give US-style software patents to UE. While listening the chamber
  of commerce and industry in Munich and Upper Bavaria, Mr. Lehne has refused
  to accept appointments with several SMEs from Düsseldorf, his own constituency,
  which is Europe's main location for patent litigation (2). How can his colleagues
  from EPP can follow such particular interests instead of accepting cross-parties
  compromise amendments? Lehne's proposition for rejection of the directive can
  only be read in this context as his fears that those 21 amendments are about
  to be democratically accepted by European Parliament.

 * [:Stoat050704En: (1) Quotes from Soate]
 * [:KlausHeinerLehneEn: (2) Lehne's background]

[:HartmutPilchEn: Hartmut Pilch] adds:

Lehne's praise for [:PiiaNooraKauppiEn: Kauppi] sounds friendly but is in fact a well-calculated attempt to abuse the name of Kauppi, with the inevitable side-effect of discrediting her before her constituencies.  Kauppi was pressured by Lehne to accept an incoherent position, consisting of 10 provisions in favor and 5 against software patentability.  Kauppi's own position, as expressed in her JURI amendments, is very close to the [:AmPlenPr050701En: 21 cross-party compromise amendments].  These amendments are no more "extreme" than the 5 adopted by the Lehne-Kauppi party line.  The only difference is that they are coherent.   The Chamber of Commerce of Munich is not in favor of the Council position as far as I know, but one can never exclude that someone sent a pro-swpat paper in their name.  That must be checked.  Anyway it's nice to see that meanwhile Lehne must go all the way to Munich to drum up some alleged SME support for software patents.
