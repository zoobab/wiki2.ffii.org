= 2004-05-13 Spanish Socialists condemn Council Paper =

Spanish MEP Rosa Miguélez said at a meeting today: 

 "Irish Presidency wants to close dossiers but this is not a dossier
 to be closed now" refering to the software patents directive because
 "it is contrary to the European Parliament plenary". Also she said
 that "because this is a codecisional procedure we are free to return
 to the plenary position in the second lecture at the European
 Parliament".

Another example of the PSOE position are the words of Mr. Rodríguez
Ibarra, President of the Extremadura autonomous comunity when he received
the European Prize for Regional Innovation, saying:

 "We believe that software patents go against solidary innovation
  and increase the digital divide."

Also he said:

   "If we patent the ideas in the knowledge society like in the
   industrial society, citizens will be excluded from common
   knowledge".

The Spanish government has however left decisionmaking on patent
policy entirely to the Spanish Patent Office OEPM.  PSOE !MEPs have opposed Arlene !McCarthy's fake limits on patentability within PSE and voted for many of the good amendments of 2004-09-24.
Ms Miguélez's statement indicates that this opposition will continue.  However it does not seem to signal a strong determination to bring the PSOE government in Madrid onto this line.
