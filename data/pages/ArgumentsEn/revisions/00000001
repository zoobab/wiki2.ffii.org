 When computers were invented about 60 years ago they were invented as a device 
 that can perform ANYTHING THAT CAN DESCRIBED IN A FINITE WAY. This includes  
 anything that can be written in a software patent submitted to the patent office. 
 It is obvious that anything these software patents can do can be done using a 
 computer, because that's the reason that computers were invented in the first place.

 So, when anyone submits a software patent, that is something that was known to be 
 possible to do on a computer in 1936, before computers were invented! And therefore 
 it is obvious and the patent should not be granted.
