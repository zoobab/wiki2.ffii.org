IBM has officially released 500 patents for use in free/opensource software and encourages other companies to follow suit, saying that "this is just a first step".  Preliminary research by FFII shows that these 500 patents have at least 100 counterparts at the EPO which are also covered by IBM's license.

== Comment ==

James Heald (FFII UK) comments:

  At the most basic level, this is obviously a good thing for OSS projects, because
  here are 500 patents OSS developers no longer have to worry about.   IBM have
  indicated that this is only the beginning, and I hope that other companies will
  follow its lead.

  It's also I think a clear recognition of the commercial benefits that IBM is
  seeing from Open Source software; and the particular difficulties that patents
  present for OSS.

  So on that level it's a welcome piece of enlightened self-interest from IBM.


  But it's unfortunate that software patents exist, that this sort of gracious 
  permission is even necessary.

  And it unfortunately does nothing to protect OSS and SMEs from patent attack
  from other companies out there, who may not share IBM's interests in promoting
  Open Source (including of course one rather large company from Redmond).

  
  Ultimately this is at best only a sideshow.  We should not get distracted from
  the real software patent issue, which is getting a directive which clearly 
  confirms no software patents in Europe.

Jonas Maebe (FFII) comments:

 In addition to what James wrote above, it's also important to point out that
 this move does not help closed source SMEs in any way. If anything, it places
 them at a relative competitive disadvantage to open source SMEs. That's
 not something FFII strives for.
