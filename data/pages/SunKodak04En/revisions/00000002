On 2004-10-01 Sun Microsystems was found guilty of infringing 3 broad patents owned by Kodak and threatened with further lawsuits seeking damages of 1.06 bn usd.  In an out-of-court settlement, Sun paid 96 mn usd to Kodak and thereby cleared Java users of the risks.  The Kodak patents also cover Microsoft's Dotnet.  Microsoft is said to be paying license fees to Kodak as well.  Kodak acquired these patents from Wang Laboratories.
