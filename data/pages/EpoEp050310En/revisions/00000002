''Brussels, 9 March 2005 -- The European Patent Office has sent an invitation to several Members of the European Parliament, inviting them to the first "patent information day" in the European Parliament. Although unsurprising, it is nonetheless remarkable that an organisation which is supposed to put the general interest before the interests of its best clients spreads such a one-sided story. The software patents directive isn't directly mentioned, but the often heard ABS example clearly shows the direction they are once more heading for.''

Many of their remarks are addressed in [[http://wiki.ffii.org/Epstein050309En|this reply]] to an article from someone who also seemed to believe that the patent system somehow by its very nature promotes innovation, regardless of what economic sector and substance it is applied to. Also interesting in this context is the fact that their patents on "computer-implemented inventions" are in fact exactly the same as plain software patents, which in the mean time is [[CIIisSwEn| widely acknowledged]] by the Commission, Council and several other involved parties (independent of the FFII).

This event shows bluntly that the EPO misuses its powers to lobby the European Parliament. From an ordoliberal perspective the EPO lacks competence to do that. The EPO has neither competence to decide on the scope of patent law nor to influence the lawmaker in regard of this question. The horse rides the rider, a common problem in the debate. We recommend the EPO to listen to the market and change its abusive policies rather than defending institutional self-interests.

 Would you buy a new car without ABS ?
 .................................................Probably not.

 Have you ever considered what is required to bring new technologies,
 such as ABS, to consumers? The conception and development of a new
 technology demands considerable time, effort and expense.

 Without patents, innovators would be offered no possibility of
   recouping their investment. 
 Without patents, innovators would have no incentive to develop their
   inventions. 
 Without patents, innovation would remain secret. 

 Patents promote innovation, technology transfer, investment,
 consumption, economic growth and jobs.

 European citizens

== 05-02-23 Official Press release ==

(from http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-02/i-epo022305.php)

 European Patent Office Information Day in the European Parliament
 
 Munich/Brussels: The European Parliament will host the first European
 Patent Office (EPO) Information Day on the 30th March 2005. The EPO
 Information Day will include a presentation to the Industry, Research
 and Energy Committee (ITRE) by EPO President Alain Pompidou and
 workshops on EPO products and services.
 
 Mr. Alain Pompidou will highlight the dynamic growth of the European
 patent system and its role for the European economy. The European
 Patent Office plays a central role in managing the flow from
 technological knowledge to innovation and from innovation to the
 market place. This year the EPO expects a new record number of nearly
 180,000 patent applications from all fields of technology.
 
 Supporting European enterprises and, consequently, the innovation
 process in the European Union, the EPO contributes to the realization
 of the Lisbon strategy, establishing the goal for the European Union
 to become knowledge-based and the most competitive economy in the
 world by 2010.
