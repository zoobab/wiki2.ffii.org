''2005-04-18 -- Universal Instruments won a legal victory last month over the individuals Kermit Aguayo and Khanh Tran of Austin. The "federal court in Texas -- plaintiffs' home court and one of the most hostile jurisdictions in the nation for defendants, according to the American Tort Reform Association."  All 17 patent claims were refused by the judge. The same plaintiffs had previously taken Motorola to court. On that occasion all 28 patent claims were thrown out - on the grounds of prior art not seen by the patent examiners. Motorola then settled out of court granting a monetary sum and allowing the plaintiffs to sue further infringments by other companies.''
