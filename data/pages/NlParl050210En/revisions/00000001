'''The chairman:''' I note that the resolution has been adopted with 71 against 69 votes.

''(note that our parliament has 150 members so the attendancy was very high, probably due to some other, high-profile topic discussed the same day)''

'''Mrs. Gerkens (Socialist Party = far left wing socialists):''' As the State Secretary is among us and the resolution is adopted, I would like to ask her to tell what sho plans to advise the cabinet (council of ministers) to do with this resolution.

'''The chairman (of the parliament):''' I leave it to the state secretary to decide whether she wants to and is able to answer to this question. I see, that is the case. The word is with the State Secretary.

'''State Secretary Van Gennip:''' I will, of course, as it should be, discuss the resolution in the cabinet. I promised the parliment (Kemer = tweede kamer = lower house) this afternoon too tell the Luxemburg presidency what should be done the coming weeks in my opinion. That was my plan anyway. The parliament will not only be updated on the developments in Brussels, but also on what I will do with the resolution. The resolution says I will endeavour that certain events will occur in a certain sequence. The parliament will hear about my efforts.
