''Copenhagen, 23rd of January 2004 -- Jacob Buksti, spokesman on european affairs of the social democratic party in the Danish Parliament, has sent a letter to Denmark's foreign minister asking the government to call for renegotiation of the software patent directive in the Council.  If the government supports the present course of adopting the draft as an A-item, the social demoracts "can not support the government", according to the letter.  If the call is followed, there must be a new vote on the directive, and the lack of a qualified majority will become apparent.''

 * The "normalised situation" refers to the election of the parliament on 8 February 2005.
 * Denmark has a minority government.
 * [[http://www.electionworld.org/denmark.htm|The social democrats are the second largest party]], so they are probably quite often needed to get things approved.

   Dear Per Stig Møller,

   In June, during the Irish presidency, a compromise concerning the so-called
   software patent directive was passed with the narrowest possible
   majority, which means that standards and interoperability
   (communication between systems/user) is not protected against
   patenting. Specifically, this means that the compromise makes it legal
   to patent standards and software, which are necessary for ensuring
   interoperability without having to run a hurdle race over various
   patents, which is very destructive for open standards, unhindered
   communication between public systems and private, and the development
   of software.

   Earlier, the Danish Social Democracy Party supported the Danish
   governments negotiation mandate, but we find that the situation has
   developed in such a way that renewed considerations about the Danish
   position is required.

   The case was on the agricultural Ministers(!) Council meeting the
   21^st December, but was removed from the agenda due the Polish
   request. However, it is uncertain if it again will turn up on the
   meeting on Monday. Should this be the case, it will under all
   circumstances be important that the Danish government informs that it
   wants the case postponed till the political situation in Denmark is
   "normalised".

   We find that it is important that time is set aside to reconsider the
   case, and we will not be able to support the government, if it is
   tried to press it through at the present time.

   Yours Sincerely

   Jacob Buksti, MP

   Spokeman on European Affairs

   The Danish Social Democracy Party
