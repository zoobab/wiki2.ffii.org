The Infocentre of the European Parliament has sent a mail to all members and staff of the European Parliament with the subject "Would you like to get a copy of Open Office or Microsoft Office against the packaging costs?"  This has raised questions within the Parliament on whether acceptance of such gifts from a company is permissible and whether the joint promotion project of the Infocentre with Microsoft is not an illicit attempt by a company to exert influence.

== Story ==

The EU Institutions have reached a deal with Microsoft.  Each MEP receives either one copy of Microsoft Office or one of !OpenOffice.org without license costs.  Since the Microsoft offerings normally cost more than 500 eur and !OpenOffice is free anyway, most users will go for Microsoft.  In this case they need to register with Microsoft at a special webpage. Thereby Microsoft receives first-hand information about the staff in EU institutions.  A member of the Directorate for Information Technology of the EP Presidency staff raised questions about this deal, doubting whether it was compatible with the duties of members of Parliament.

 packaging costs only?

 Where?    The Infocentre

 To whom does the offer apply?

 As a part of the migration to the Microsoft Windows XP Operation
 System all permanent staff members (officials and temporary agents)
 may now profit from one of two options :

 * Either you can get a copy of the Open Source Open Office for
   Windows

 * Or you can get a copy of or an upgrade to the newest Microsoft
   Office package for Windows

 How come?

 The European Institutions have negotiated this offer with Microsoft
 as a part of the Microsoft Home Office Program and the European
 Parliament has decided to include Open Office in the offer as well.

 Will it last forever?

 The offer remains valid during the length of the contract with
 Microsoft and as long as you are employed by the European Parliament
 as an official or temporary agent.

 Will I get support from the Infocentre? 

 The Infocentre provides no support. Nor does your LSA, nor Microsoft
 nor the distributors of Open Office.



 How do I get a copy?

 You must go to the Infocentre in Brussels, ASP01E035 or to the
 Infocentre in Luxembourg, KAD 06B012. Please do not forget to bring
 your staff badge.

 If you want Open Office: 

 Bring a blank CD (minimum size 650MB) and we will burn it for you.

 Please note: Only one copy per user.

 If you want Microsoft Office:

 Fill in the attached registration form and bring it to the Infocentre

 copy by registering at Microsoft's homepage. Microsoft will then send
 the CD to your home address.

 Please note: Microsoft charges you a fee of EUR 28,44 (may be subject
 to changes) covering packaging, handling, shipping and administration,
 which you'll have to pay by credit card at their website.

== Letter from Information Technology Directorate at EP Presidency ==

  Dear InfoCentre:

  Could you clarify whether, in accepting this generous and
  priviledged offer from Microsoft, a member of staff is in breach of
  Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Staff Regulations, that states
  clearly that:

  "An official shall not without the permission of the appointing
  authority accept from any government or from any other source outside
  the institution to which he belongs any honour, decoration, favour,
  gift or payment of any kind whatever..."

  I understand that the staff are being offered a collective favour by
  Microsoft, is that correct? Has this been cleared by the Appointing
  Authority? Or is their permission implicit in the decision to offer
  this favour?

  I am concerned that without explicit authorisation, we are placing
  ourselves in a "porte-à-faux" with regard to the regulations....

  Best regards,
