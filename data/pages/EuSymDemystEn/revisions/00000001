''Someone called "I" started a wiki page asking questions about symbols in EU documents and giving some hints as to what he has found they might mean.''

== Explanations on symbols in EU Council documents ==

 * [http://www.europa.eu.int/prelex/aide.cfm?CL=en&manualcat_id=api some explanations]

== Questions posed by anonymous "I" ==

For example let's take
http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/fr/04/st11/st11979.fr04.pdf

There are several symbols on the first page that I am curious what they
mean:

1) in the top right corner, under Bruxelles there is (OR, en)

2) does the document number 11979/04 have any logic behind it?
   I know 04 is year 2004, and I noticed that usually the first two
   digits change when there is a change of the month of "Document Date",
   but it might be just coincidence, I did not check too many yet.

3) what is "PI 61" and "CODEC 962"?
   Its descibed as "Subject Matter" but any more details?
   CODEC might be CODECISION

4) in the footer there is something like "JG/cb" or "GA/jw" (that was in
   an english version of that document. That might have something to do
   with the translator...

5) and finally what is DG C1 also in the footer?

   DG C1 is the organisational body in the Commission. Ask Ph. Aigrain for explaition.
   Arebenti: DG = Directorate General I assume


Is there an explanation somewhere of all this?

Also the funny EU notation like

PV/CONS 28
COMPET 76
RECH 100

or

6580/02 PI 10 CODEC 242
11503/03 CODEC 995 PI 70
9277/04 PI 41 CODEC 693
     + ADD 1

This explains some of the abbreviations:

out of http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st09/st09586.en04.pdf
is not yet perfectly clear to me.
