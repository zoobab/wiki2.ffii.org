== Rejection/Acceptance ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 47 | Greens+GUE | +++ | The European Parliament rejects the Commission proposal. |

 * the European Data Protection Officer thinks the directive is not necessary and has concerns regarding respect for human rights
 * the Article 29 Working Party from across Europe have called for numerous safeguards that are almost entirely lacking
 * Privacy Commissioners, civil liberties organisations, consumer organisations and service providers from across Europe have endorsed our statement calling for the rejection of this directive (www.privacyinternational.org/retention)
 * 58,000 individuals from across Europe have signed a petition opposing data retention (www.dataretentionisnosolution.com)
 * the directive is being rushed through Parliament in 3 months (making a mockery of the codecision procedure)
 * countless countries have already rejected data retention, e.g. U.S. and Canada have no plans for data retention
 * where national debate have occurred, retention policies are very limited
 * studies have been misrepresented by the Commission and the Council
 * criminals have plenty of ways to get around the proposed measures
 * anyone who uses Hotmail or Googlemail are circumventing the proposed system
 * the telecom industry and civil society have serious concerns and were barely heard during the preparation of the text
 * the proposed measures indicate a serious lack of understanding regarding how the Internet actually works
 * deals are being struck behind the scenes to pre-empt a proper democratic process
 * the responsible EP Committee (LIBE) was extremely critical
 * the discussion in national parliaments is not over, and in some have not yet begun
 *  some national governments are using the European Parliament to launder this policy after they have already been rejected by their national parliaments

== Draft legislative resolution Paragraph 2 ==
| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | |
| ## | LIBE+IMCO | ++ |  Calls on the Commission, prior to the entry into force of this Directive, to commission an impact assessment study from an independent body representing all stakeholders, covering all internal market and consumer protection issues; |
| 48 | EPP+PSE | - | Calls on the Commission for an impact assessment study (deletion) covering all internal market and consumer protection issues; |

This is an irregularity since the text marked as ## was originally an amendment in the IMCO committee. It was carried both there and in LIBE and incorporated in the LIBE report. Nevertheless, it is not tabled in plenary for some reason. Of course impact assessments should be done before making laws and such studys should be made by independent bodies.

== Draft legislative resolution Paragraph 2.a ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | |
| 49 | EPP+PSE | - | (2a) Considers that, concerning access to data, the present directive constitutes just a necessary first step and calls on the Council for loyal cooperation for the swift adoption of appropriate guarantees in the context of the framework decision on data protection and data treatment in judicial and police co-operation in criminal matters; |

== Draft legislative resolution Paragraph 2.b ==

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | |
| 50 | EPP+PSE | - | (2b) Considers that the Member States have the right to apply their national constitutional principles and considers especially that professional secrecy will also be respected in the application of the present directive; |

The "professional secrecy" clause here means lawyers activities. It is unethical to give a privacy privilege to only one field of profession. Many other acttivities that are usually considered to be highly sensitive and protected by constitutional law will be captured by this mandatory retention regime: free expression, access to religious and political information, communications and iteractions with medical information sources, etc.

It has been known for many years that the mandatory data retention policy fails to discriminate protected-privileged activities and is thus overly broad and illegal according to ECHR jurisprudence. To include a "lawyers only" proposal recognises the ECHR conflict.

== Article 1.1 ==
| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | This Directive aims to harmonise the provisions of the Member States concerning obligations on the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of a public communications network with respect to the processing and retention of certain data, in order to ensure that the data is available for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences, such as terrorism and organised crime. |
| 19 | LIBE | - | This Directive aims to harmonise the provisions of the Member States concerning obligations on the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of a communications network with respect to the processing and retention of certain data, and to ensure that the rights to the respect for private life and to the protection of personal data in the access and use of these data are fully respected, in order to ensure that the data is available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences, as referred to in Article 2(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA(1). (1) Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1). |
| 69 | EPP+PSE | -- | This Directive aims to harmonise the provisions of the Member States concerning obligations on the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of a public communications network with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law. |

Commission proposal makes a narrow interpretation of which crimes retained data can be used for possible, since it refers to "terrorism and organised crime", it also true to the directive's original justification to "prevent terrorism". If not amended, this article makes the whole directive easier to take to court.

LIBE referes to the crimes in the European Arrest Warrant, which is an open ended list of crimes (including fraud and piracy). The European Arrest Warrant is deemed unconstitutional in Germany and is put on suspention in Poland. It may also lead to a broadening of use of the retained data.

EPP+PSE does not impose any limitation at all to which crimes retained data can be used for and also widens the scope of which data communication providers must retain by extending it from data processed to data "generated or processed". The Council and EPP+PSE are calling for the harmonisation of data retention even while there are very few countries that have implemented data retention on this scale (less than five); and yet are not calling for the harmonisation of access safeguards.  It is thus clear that the Directive's goal is to increase the powers of governments whilst reducing safeguards and minimising national debate.

== Article 1.2 ==
| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | This Directive shall apply to traffic and location data of both private and legal persons, as well as the related data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user. It shall not apply to the content of electronic communications, including information consulted using an electronic communications network. |
| 20 | LIBE | + | This Directive shall apply to traffic and location data of both private and legal persons, as well as the data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user. It shall not apply to the content of electronic communications, including information consulted using an electronic communications network. (This amendment applies throughout the text. Adopting it will necessitate corresponding changes throughout). |

LIBE is deleting the word "related", thus minimising the amount of data subject to this Directive.


== Article 2.2.point(a) ==
| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | (a) "data" means traffic data and location data, as well as the related data necessary to identify the subscriber or user; |
| 21 | LIBE | ++ | (a) "data" means traffic data and location data, as well as the data necessary to identify the subscriber or user; (aa) 'competent national authorities' means the judicial authorities and national authorities responsible for the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences. |

It is essential to harmonise the safeguards for access and providing that this access is regulated through judicial authorities.  Access to traffic data in the U.S. is permitted only through court order; yet in the UK it is self-authorised by law enforcement officials.  Access to this sensitive data must be highly controlled.

== Article 2.2.point(ba)(new) ==
| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Commission | N/A | - |
| 22 | LIBE | - | (ba) "serious criminal offences" means the offences referred to in Article 2(2) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA. |
| 70 | EPP+PSE | - | (ba) "telephone service" means calls (including voice, voicemail, conference or data), supplementary services (including call forwarding and call transfer), messaging and multi-media services (including Short Message Services, Enhanced Media Services and Multi-Media Services). |

Regarding am 22, we are concerned that the list of 'serious crimes' will only increase.  Every country within the EU has been working hard to ensure that anti-terror laws established in recent years apply to all forms of investigations; we do not believe that it will be long before the same happens here.  By hinging it on the list within Arrest Warrant, this will ensure that both the arrest warrant and the retention regime will expand in use over time.

For am 70, prior to expanding the list of services we require impact assessments.

Am 27 recognises that data protection and ECHR protections of the right to privacy must be maintained.  Even if data retention is not implemented across the EU we must regulate access to this sensitive data as others have already done.  For instance, in the U.S. and Canada judicial authorisation must be sought, and in some circumstances, e.g. internet traffic data and location data, the judicial review requires the highest degree of proof from the state.  Such protects are seriously lacking in Europe.

Am 76 leves these essential protections to national law and thereby negates the need for harmonising the retention of this data.  It is improper to ensure greater surveillance across the EU with no clear requirements for essential safeguards.

Regarding am 34, governments have not made the case for the retention of this information even while other countries prefer to implement the less invasive and more specific means of 'data preservation'.  Under this process only the required amount of information is preserved in specific cases involving specific investigations of specific individuals.

Even when studies have been done to investigate how long data should be retained, in only the most exceptional cases was this data needed for more than three months.

If data retention is to occur, in accordance with safeguards announced by the Article 29 Working Party, this data must be kept for the shortest period of time.  

Regarding am 81, the EU can not claim that the purpose of this directive is to harmonise retention when it continues to permit countries to retain data for more than one year when the Commission originally proposed that it was reasonable to limit the period to one year.  We do not trust the sincerity of the proponents of this policy so long as they appear comfortable in extending the period of retention

Already some countries are calling for this data to be kept for three years (Ireland), if not longer (Poland recently called for 15 years).

The Commission shall submit these statistics to the European Parliament each year and then each three years. |

As risks and costs are substantial with large and complex data retention systems it is crucial to collect statistics on many aspects of their function. In the light of recent and costly abuse of surveillance systems in e.g. Germany and the Netherlands it is particularily important to include statistics on suspected and factual security breaches of these systems.

Amendment 41=93 is unacceptable to the Council, and therefore would guarantee a second reading with the possibility of proper discussions instead of hasty backroom compromises. This directive needs at least two readings. The deletion of the cost issue also conflicts with the legal basis for this directive, namely art 95 function of internal market.

Particularly as Member States are insisting on their right to retain this data for extended periods of time, these Member States must be required to cover the costs of retention and provision of traffic data to law enforcement authorities.  Otherwise consumers in Europe will be forced to bear the costs of retention even as consumers in other countries around the world who have rejected retention, e.g. the U.S. and Canada, will not have these additional costs.

A Member State facing particular circumstances warranting an extension for a limited period of the maximum retention period referred to in Article 7 may take the necessary measures. The Member State shall immediately notify the Commission and inform the other Member States of the measures taken by virtue of this Article and indicate the grounds for introducing them. 2. The Commission shall, within six months after the notification as referred to in paragraph 1, approve or reject the national measures involved after having verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction of trade between Member States and whether or not they shall constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.  In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national measures shall be deemed to have been approved. 3. When, pursuant to paragraph 2, the national measures of a Member State derogating from the provisions of this Directive are approved, the Commission may examine whether to propose an adaptation of this Directive. |

Member States who have been pushing for data retention because of the need for harmonising rules must not be equally permitted to expand the length of the period of retention.  This negates all the safeguards and protections within this directive.

This clause and amendment 43 only prove that the case for retention has not yet been made and yet the Parliament is being asked to move forward on this and to then reconsider this after two years.

This 'trial and error'  approach to civil liberties is unacceptable.

As a matter of habit and course, once taken away liberties are rarely restored.

Amendment 89 proposes turning a safeguard (questioning retention after a period of time) into a power grab (extending retention after a period of time).  This is a reflection on all of the amendments proposed by the Council and the EPP and PSE.

Any interference into the private lives of individuals as provided for in Article 8.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights must be limited to what is strictly necessary in a democratic society, and proportionate.

Communications traffic data is highly sensitive information regarding the interests, movements and associations of all individuals within Europe.

| 52 | EPP+PSE | -- | Under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, everyone has the right to respect for his private life and his correspondence. Interference by a public authority with the exercise of that right may only be made in accordance with the law and if it is necessary in a democratic society, inter alia, in the interests of national security, public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Because retention of data has proven to be such a necessary and effective investigative tool for law enforcement in investigations in several Member States and in particular into serious cases such as organized crime and terrorism, it is therefore necessary to ensure availability of retained data to law enforcement for a certain period of time under the conditions provided for in the present Directive. The adoption of an instrument on data retention is therefore a necessary measure in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. |

Numerous officials, experts, and legal bodies have declared that the indiscriminate collection of data on all individuals without any foreseeability contravenes the ECHR.  Additionally, data retention has not proven to be necessay and effective, as required by the ECHR.

To turn the ECHR on its head and argue that a retention directive is necessary is indicative of the problems with the EPP and PSE amendments.  These amendments turn safeguards into power grabs, limitations into extensions, protections of individual rights into interferences with the private lives of individuals.

Article 8 by no means requires data retention.  Article 8 and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights actually abhors policies such as indiscriminate retention of personal data.

Data retention is not necessary, proportionate, technologically reasonable and will seriously damage consumer confidence and international competitiveness.  Any increase of data collection will likely aid policing but it is up to policy-makers to do so in accordance with constitutional and legal requirements, i.e. in accordance with the ECHR.  As a result this entire amendment continues to make a leap of logic even as it tries to lessen the Commission's original logical flaws.

Despite numerous attempts, proponents of data retention have yet to make the specific case that indiscriminate and extended retention of communications traffic data is necessary in a democratic society and proportionate.  There is a serious lack of research on the need for retention, and what little research exists does not make a conclusive case for retention by any means.  In fact many countries that have implemented new powers after terrorist attacks, e.g. the U.S. have also rejected data retention policies.  So any declarations of the absolute need for retention are based on weak grounds.

Whilst data retention is clearly in contravention with the requirements of the ECHR, policies on access to traffic data must certainly be proportionate and necessary in a democratic society, and thus require careful consideration of the benefits of the interferences and the level of
the intrusion.

LIBE properly points out the concerns of the European Data Protection Supervisor (human rights, necessity and proportionality), civil society (idem) and the conclusions of the Erasmus University study (unclear whether the proposed measures will actually help the fight against criminality and terrorism).

The interpretation of EPP+PSE of legal rights of European residents and citizens is faulty and excludes the points of view expressed repeatedly by a number of organisations and EU institutions, as outlined by the LIBE amendment.

| 15 | LIBE | + | (18a) Since the security of data retained under this Directive is of paramount importance for the safeguarding of consumers' rights, Member States should ensure that the highest standards of data storage security are applied, in particular the protection of data from alteration and unauthorized access, as well as from internet and non-internet related threats. |
| 16 | LIBE | + | (18b) The security of data under this Directive must be in compliance with the data protection provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC. |

Common sense. Data retention is not necessary, proportionate, technologically reasonable and will seriously damage consumer confidence and international competitiveness.  Traditional legal requirements as required by the ECHR under Article 8 and the Directive 95/46/EC must continue to apply regardless.

| *** | Commission | N/A | (19) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; in particular, this Directive together with Directive 2002/58/EC, seeks to ensure full respect of the fundamental rights to respect the private life and communications of citizens and the protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter), |
| 17 | LIBE | ++ | (19) This Directive could better respect the fundamental rights and the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; in particular, this Directive together with Directive 2002/58/EC, and seek to ensure full respect of the fundamental rights to respect the private life and communications of citizens and the protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter) as well as the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. |

The LIBE amendment refers to  two ECJ judgements to support its assertions, which was also expressed by the European Data Protection Supervisor.

| 18 | LIBE | ++ | (19a) The Member States should ensure that the implementation of this Directive takes place following consultations with the business sector, particularly as regards feasibility and cost of retention. In view of the fact that retention entails a practical and financial effort from businesses, the Member States should guarantee full compensation for additional costs incurred by businesses as a result of obligations or commitments relating to the transposition of this Directive.  |
| 66 | EPP+PSE | -- | Considering that the obligations on providers of electronic communications services should be proportionate, the Directive requires that they only retain such data which are generated or processed in the process of supplying their communications services; to the extent that such data is not generated or processed by those providers, there can be no obligation to retain it. This Directive is not intended to harmonise the technology for retaining data, the choice of which will be a matter to be resolved at national level. |

Data retention places a significant burden on European industry that is unprecedented even as other jurisdictions have rejected similar policies.  If the EU is to embark on this unprecedented policy then it must ensure that European consumers are not burdened with additional costs even while it is likely that they
will chose instead to use non-EU services, again to the detriment of EU industry.

The concerns of the business sector regarding implementation have been disregarded by the Commission based on one case study performed in the Netherlands. However, the conclusions of that study are being contested by even the responsible Committee in the Dutch Senate (as being outdated already, since e.g. the applicable Internet traffic has more than tripled since it was performed one year ago).

| 67 | EPP+PSE | -- | It should be remembered that Paragraph 34 of the Inter-institutional agreement on better law-making (OJ C 321, 31.12.2003.) states that the Council "will encourage the Member States to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the community, their own tables which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between directives and the transposition measures and to make them public". |

The EPP and PSE amendments again point to additional flexibility for Member States
to increase surveillance while calling for the harmonisation of increased powers. 
This is non-sensical.

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 68 | EPP+PSE | 0 | The present Directive is without prejudice to the power of Member States to adopt legislative measure concerning the right of access to and use of data by national authorities as designated by them. Issues of access to data retained pursuant to this Directive by national public authorities for such activities as are referred to in the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46/EC fall outside the scope of Community law. However, they may be the subject of national law, or action pursuant to Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, always noting that such laws or action must fully respect fundamental rights as they result from the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and as they are guaranteed by the ECHR. Article 8 ECHR, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights, requires that interference by public authorities with privacy rights must respond to requirements of necessity and proportionality and must therefore serve specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and be exercised in a manner which is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose of the interference.  |

The EPP and PSE amendments again point to additional flexibility for Member States
to increase surveillance while calling for the harmonisation of increased powers. 
It has long been established that indiscriminate data collection contravenes the
ECHR.  Therefore the EPP and PSE statements are non-sensical.

| *** | Commission | N/A | Types of data to be retained under the categories identified in Article 4 of this Directive: a) Data necessary to trace and identify the source of a communication: (1) Concerning Fixed Network Telephony: (a) The calling telephone number; (b) Name and address of the subscriber or registered user; (2) Concerning Mobile Telephony: (a) The calling telephone number; (b) Name and Address of the subscriber or registered user; (3) Concerning Internet Access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (a) The Internet Protocol (IP) address, whether dynamic or static, allocated by the Internet access provider to a communication; (b) Name(s) and address(es) of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s) who are the intended recipient(s) of the communication. c) Data necessary to identify the date, time and duration of a communication: (1) Concerning Fixed Network Telephony and Mobile Telephony: (a) The date and time of the start and end of the communication. (2) Concerning Internet Access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony: (a) The date and time of the log-in and log-off of the Internet sessions based on a certain time zone. d) Data necessary to identify the type of communication: (1) Concerning Fixed Network Telephony: (a) The telephone service used, e.g. voice, (...missing text...) |

This amendment points to the serious challenges in identifying the appropriate data
to be retained under this policy and therefore indicates how complex this policy
actually is.  Therefore we call for the rejection of the policy in its current form
and the amended form as proposed by the EPP and PSE in particular because they
ignore these challenges and complexities.
