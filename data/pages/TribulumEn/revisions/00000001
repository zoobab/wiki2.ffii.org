= Separate the wheat from the chaff =

(draft)

=== Purpose ===

This article explains what directive is needed to seperate the wheat from chaff. That is allow patenting of hardware patents and consumer electronics and confirm the non-patentability of software [1]. It is the the obligation of the law maker to clarify patent legislation and maintain a plain level field for entreprenuers on the Single Market. The current EPO practise that hampered competition has to be restrained.

=== Remarks ===

[1] Often the destinction is made of non-patentability of software and non-patentability of software "as such". However this phrase "as such" is meaningless and derived from the wording of EPC 52(3) and thus part of a misinterpretation of article 52. Therefore we will not make the distinctions unless some institution defines the difference of software "as such" and software.
