Unnoticed by FFII the german computing business magazine Computerwoche has started a poll amon its readers, asking them "do you want software to be patentable in Europe like in the US?"

The result resembles that of an earlier [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eukonsult00/ Consultation of the European Commission]: with more than 90% saying No.

In spite of attempts by the patent lobby to distance themselves from the US practise, it is clear to everyone in the field that [:SwpatuseujpEn: there is no significant difference between the US practise and the recent practise of the European Patent Office] which the [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/index.en.html Council's proposal] codifies.
