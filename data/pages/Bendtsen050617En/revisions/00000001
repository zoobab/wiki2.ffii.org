''17. Juni 2005 -- Denmark's minister of Economic Affairs Bendt Bendtsen has written a letter to the EU Council presidency in which he criticises the practice of the European Patent Office regarding software and business method patents and expresses support for the intentions and basic approach of the European Parliament's rapporteur Michel Rocard in establishing stricter limits on patentability.''

The [http://swpat.ffii.org/log/05/bendtsen0617/ letter] summarises the findings of a government-appointed committee that has studied the matters in Denmark during the last months.  Previously the Danish government had shown some "unhappiness" with the Council's pro-patent line but had never expressed clearly in which way it would like to change this line.  At several occasions the government failed to resist the Council presidency when its vote could have made a difference.  The present letter to the Council presidency is the clearest expression of a stance of the Danish government heard of so far.  The letter was sent out at a moment where the Council presidency was trying to built up pressure against Rocard through [:Trilog0506En: Trilog] meetings in Brussels backrooms.

  Exped. no. 197989

  Dear Jeannot Krecké

  As I mentioned in my letter of 19 May 2005 the proposal for a directive
  on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions has attracted
  much attention in Denmark. Against the background of the negotiations
  currently conducted in the European Parliament I would like to provide
  some details as to the statement made by Denmark at the Council meeting
  on 7 March 2005.

  The statement points out the fact that in the future negotiations
  Denmark will attach particular importance to ensuring that only
  technical inven­tions can be patented, that neither pure software
  programs nor business methods can be patented and that access to
  interoperability is ensured.

  In Denmark we have followed the debate in the Parliament with keen
  in­terest, particularly the work of Parliament rapporteur Michel Rocard.
  Generally we support the intentions behind rapporteur Rocard's report,
  which is in keeping with the views presented by Denmark. It is important
  that we now fïnd the right solutions to the problems raised.

  Clear definitions are needed of what is required to obtain a patent so
  that we can avoid any inexpedient developments of practice, such as the
  unfortunate examples seen under the European Patent Organisation. The
  rules must aim to ensure that we do not end up with American conditions
  in Europe.

  The rules regarding patenting of computer-implemented inventions must be
  uniform and transparent It should not be possible to patent pure
  soft­ware programs where the only "technical" contribution is that the
  pro­gram runs on a computer. Similarly it should not be possible to
  patent business methods.

  In rapporteur Rocard's positive defïnition of what it takes to obtain a
  pat­ent he refers to the fact that only inventions using forces of
  nature can be designated as technical and are consequently patentable.
  Even though the concept of "forces of nature" is new within patent law
  and consequently results in a certain uncertainty as to its
  interpretation, rapporteur Rocard's defïnition means that pure software
  programs (e.g. pure algo-rithms/mathematical methods) and business
  methods are exempted from the patentable area, which is completely in
  keeping with the Danish wishes. Denmark consequently supports the
  intentions behind rapporteur Rocard's proposal for a positive
  definition. Pure software programs will remain protected in pursuance of
  the law of copyright.

  With regard to a negative definition of patentable inventions Denmark
  believes that the processing of information in itself should not be able
  to constitute a patentable invention. But there are several situations
  where a technical contribution (new knowledge about the use of forces of
  nature) is made in which case the invention should be patentable. Such
  is e.g. the case if the processing of information forms an important
  part of a physical product.

  Patentability should require a high degree of inventive step. The
  inventive step should be defïned based on what even an expert in the
  area would find surprising.

  Consequently it should remain possible to patent e.g. control systems
  for wind turbines and programs improving the audio quality of
  loudspeakers and hearing aids in the future as well. Patent protection
  is important in the interest of the future development and researches
  within i.a. these areas.

  It is important that the rules are not drawn up static but in such a way
  as to allow for future technologies and development opportunities.

  Rapporteur Rocard points out the importance of interoperability. The
  problem of interoperability is closely connected with the criteria set
  for obtaining a patent. Therefore these two problems should be regarded
  in close connection.

  Denmark agrees that we need to introduce a provision into the proposal
  for the directive ensuring non-limited, easy access to interoperability.
  It must not be possible to prevent interoperability. It is in society's
  interest that access to communicating with one another is not unduly
  prevented.

  Therefore the challenge lies in formulating a perfectly balanced
  provision. Today undertakings apply the rules of competition law
  regarding abuse of a dominant position or the existing compulsory
  licensing system according to which the patent holder in certain cases
  is ordered to accept a third party's exploitation of its patent.
  However, it is my impression that these systems are rarely used and
  particularly small undertakings find them much too resource-intensive
  and time-consuming. This is unfortu-nate, especially in an area such as
  information and Communications tech-nology where developments are very
  rapid. Consequently it is my opinion that neither of these systems will
  be adequate for ensuring access to interoperability.

  Denmark would like to see that the possibilities of a special set-up to
  help ensure rapid access to interoperability for the technologies
  essential to the information infrastructure are considered, such as the
  Internet. Such access to interoperability must be possible without the
  permission of the patent holder if necessary to ensure interoperability
  between two or more computer programs and if no other equally effective
  or efficiënt non-patented method exists. However, the access to
  interoperability must not be used in such a way that it conflicts with
  the patent holder's legitimate interests or goes beyond normal
  exploitation of the invention. At the same time the software developer's
  legitimate interests in obtaining inter­operability should be considered,
  as should the end-users' interests in having access to
  interoperable programs.

  It is not a matter of establishing a system similar to the existing
  compulsory licensing system. The criteria are and should be different.
  At the same time a procedure should be established which provides the
  undertakings with access to a rapid and easy opinion on whether it is
  possible to use a patented technology for obtaining interoperability.
  However, it should be left to the Member States themselves to asses how
  they can best establish an administrative procedure to that effect.

  Acts that can freely be performed under the Copyright Directive
  (91/250/EEC) regarding legal protection of computer programs shall
  remain freely performable without the patent holder's permission.

  As mentioned I believe that the vague wording of the current rules in
  the area is the cause of the current existence of patents that should
  never have been granted. Therefore Denmark has commenced a process in
  which we together with other EPO member countries have called into
  question the quality of the patents granted. This also involves the
  question of inventive step. In its recent report "Recommendations for
  the Patent System of the Future", the Danish Board of Technology also
  recommends that clear criteria be laid down for the evaluation of the
  inventive step for computer-implemented inventions. This way the
  granting of trivial and too broad patents is attempted to be avoided.
  Denmark supports this recommendation.

  I hope that the above can contribute positively to the continued
  negotiations and please allow me, once again, to point out the
  importance of in-volving the Member States and the Competitiveness
  Council in the future negotiations.

  Yours sincerely,

  Bendt Bendtsen
