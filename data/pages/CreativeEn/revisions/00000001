== Creative patents preventing progress of 3D gaming? ==

At the occasion of the Creative-ID row, a Slashdot commentator [http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=17525 writes]:

  This is what really annoys me about this system and
  companies like Creative Labs (who haven't made an innovative
  product since the mid-90s). They simply buy up all sorts of
  technology (Aureal, Sensaura, EMU, Ensoniq, etc.) and slack
  off with their own products. Creative hasn't done anything
  substantial with their soundcards since the Live series was
  released (even then it was sub-par in terms of quality), and
  has simply re-released the same DSP with some pumped-up
  driver hacks and better codecs. It's no wonder that
  companies like M-Audio and Turtle Beach have produced
  sonically superior products for the average consumer.

  Unfortunately, other areas of audio have suffered. There is
  no "OpenGL" of 3D audio because Creative owns all of the
  patents from its acquisition of companies like Aureal and
  Sensaura. They will always have the one-up on 3D audio
  performance over their customers, and any improvements will
  be at their own pace. PC audio has been so stale over the
  last few years. It's sad to see that it's come down to this,
  but literally. 

  PC audio has gone virtually nowhere because of patent issues
  like this. This issue with their (stealing) patenting of
  Carmack's Reverse really shows why we are probably set-back
  several years in terms of a truly awesome 3D audio
  experience.
