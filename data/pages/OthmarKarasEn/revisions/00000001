Othmar Karas is a member of the European Parliamennt for the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) for Salzburg, Economic Affairs Spokesman of both ÖVP and the European People's Party (EPP) as well as vice president of the EPP.  Karas has, both during the first reading and during the Council's attempts to pass its position with an unqualified majority in 2004, supported key amendments to the proposed software patent directive and repeatedly criticised attempts by the Council and Commission to ignore these amendments.  As one of ÖVP's most popular politicians, Karas has been successfully campaigning for personal votes, a specialty of the Austrian election system.
