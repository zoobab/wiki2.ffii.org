=== Gilles Harfang's tips on translating this document ===

There is information on how to get started with translating the FFII site at 
http://wiki.ael.be/index.php/FightingSWPatentsTranslation

=== Typesetting error in Art 2a ===

One instance of %q(...) was not expanded. -- PG

Fixed, but some translators are miswriting markers like %(q:...).

=== Art 4.1 comment wording ===

Our comments to Art 4.1 say: "fix the bug". I doubt that "bug" is understood
as a synonym for "error" outside the circles of computer programmers. -- PG
