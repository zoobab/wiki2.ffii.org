Art II-17/2 says

  "Intellectual property shall be protected".

Better wordings would be:

   "The rights of authors, inventors and users will be protected and the necessary provisions
   taken to ensure fair competition."

or, in analogy to the US Constitution:

   "The European Parliament shall have the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts
   by giving authors and inventors limited exclusion rights over the fruits of their work."

 
For reference, Article 27 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

   "(1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community,
        to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
    (2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting
        from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author."
