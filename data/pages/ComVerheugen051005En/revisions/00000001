=== Proposals from "A policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing", launched 5 October 2005. ===

 An Intellectual Property Rights and Counterfeiting Initiative (2006)

 Intellectual and industrial property rights (IPR) are of key importance 
 for the competitiveness of many industrial sectors. While key areas have
 already been harmonized, more can be done to ensure that the regulatory 
 framework meets the needs of industry at a time of rapid technological 
 development and societal change. Companies and their clients need IPR 
 which stimulates innovation, provides a stable context in which to make 
 investment decisions, and encourages the development of efficient new 
 business models. The debate engendered by the proposed directive on the 
 patentability of computer-implemented inventions has demonstrated that 
 framing IPR rules which balance the needs of all stakeholders is by no 
 means easy. The Commission will therefore launch a dialogue with industry
 and other interested parties in 2006 to determine what more might usefully
 be done to provide European industry with a sound IPR framework. In 
 addition, the proper enforcement of IPR within the internal market and 
 in third countries is of the highest importance to fight counterfeiting 
 and piracy occurring in many sectors. Infringements of IPR can jeopardize 
 legitimate businesses, threaten innovation and sometimes pose problems to 
 public health and safety. Many companies, in particular SMEs, are still 
 not aware of their rights to obtain adequate IP protection, whilst 
 counterfeiting continues to be a major problem in many areas of trade. 
 Taking account existing and planned anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy 
 instruments and measures, including those in the enforcement24 and customs
 fields, the Commission will review the state of progress in the whole area
 of IPR with a focus on competitiveness issues and come up with suggestions
 on how to improve the situation in 2006.


 Taskforce on ICT Competitiveness (2005/2006)

 To ensure that public policy provides a supportive environment for the
 competitiveness of an evolving ICT sector, a taskforce with stakeholders
 representatives will be set up. Adding to the initiatives the Commission
 is undertaking under i2010, it will identify key obstacles to competitiveness
 and possible policy responses, for example in terms of better regulation,
 skills, IPR, and standardization. The taskforce will also permit a structured
 dialogue to help mobilize the sector and to draw the attention of Member states
 to the barriers to the competitiveness of ICT manufacturing in Europe and to
 the obstacles to wide and effective take-up.


 A series of competitiveness studies, including for the ICT, food,
 and fashion and design industries

 These studies will analyse the trends affecting the competitiveness of 
 industrial sectors with a view to deriving further proposals for concrete
 policies and actions where necessary.
