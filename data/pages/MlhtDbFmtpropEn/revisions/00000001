== Outline ==

 * the database does not yet exist
 * it will be needed at least to specify the formats in which a document is available, such as
   * latex
   * html
 * data that are specific to a particular format (e.g. whether a page was validated as correct html by w3c standards) belong into another database, such as htmlprop.
 * it is not clear yet what belongs into fmtprop apart from the fact that the format is used.
