''3 March 2005 -- The Commissioner for the Internal Market is coming to the Conference of Presidents in the European Parliament at 11.00 to represent the European Commission.''

The Presidents had invited Barroso, but Barroso had [[Barroso050302En| declined]].

On Monday Barroso had moreover [[http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/barroso0502/|declined the Parliament's restart request in writing without giving a reason]], but it is [[Com050228En| known]] that the main reason is the unwillingness of !McCreevy and the DG which he represents.

The EP's Legal Affairs Committee had already heard !McCreevy and voted 19:2 against his arguments.  The purpose of today's meeting had been to talk directly to Barroso, who is responsible for the rejection of the Parliament's request and who should have coordinated a collegiate decision involving all the directorates of the Commission, rather than just transmitted the wish of the leading Commissioner.
