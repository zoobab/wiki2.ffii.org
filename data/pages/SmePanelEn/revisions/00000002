= DG Internal Market, not happy with the consultation results, launched a parallel consultation via the EICs =

== Subject of the panel ==
  
  The first subject submitted to the panel of SMEs will be dealing with
  the patent systems and the intellectual property rights. The
  questionnaires and the background documents are attached to this e-mail.
  
  The subject of the panel was decided by the two units dealing with the
  issue: unit D2 in DG MARKT and unit D1 of DG ENTR.
  
  DG MARKT D2 launched some weeks ago an on-line consultation on patent
  systems (translation in German of this part of the questionnaire is
  available upon request).
  
  Nevertheless, taking into account the subject's complexity and the
  difficulties faced in obtaining answers directly from SMEs, DG MARKT
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  considered that the SME Panel tool would be very useful because it would
  support and complete the results already obtained in the on-line
  consultation.
  
  The objective behind this consultation is to study the possibility for
  further developing the patent system legal framework.
  
  DG ENTR D1 would like to explore the systems implemented at national
  level and to obtain examples of good practices, in order to evaluate the
  possibility of elaborating a series of practical recommendations to the
  Member States.
