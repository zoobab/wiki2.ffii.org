== Intro & General Observations ==

 * campaign to put EU money into an insurance that covers patent litigation costs (mostly for asserting patents, according to some versions also for defence against patents) of !SMEs, started around 2001
 * a means of extending patent lobby influence to !SMEs that have, to the great disarray of the patent movement, to a large extent stayed outside of the system and are potentially hostile to it.   State funding for patent insurance is an extension of existing funding for institutions such as "IPR Helpdesk", which create a lot of posts for pro-patent activists who can, if not really create a working insurance system, at least use this influence to gain footholds in !SMEs
 * propagated by 
   * [[SwxaiAllvoiceEn| Allvoice]] (patent company celebrated by the patent movement) and the "Patent Defence Union" which their CEO John Mitchell leads.  They say "defence" but mean aggression.

   * Quotes from this document:

  P21 "General reluctance of underwriters to accept risk
  in areas such as biotech and software"

  P37
  "
  A further problem is the reluctance of
  certain insurers to offer protection in the higher risk
  areas of biotechnology, medical technology and
  computer software (areas of technology that many of
  the SME?s are working in) or if cover is provided,
  the premium is high following a costly IP due
  diligence and risk assessment usually paid for by
  clients before premium is quoted."

  P42
  "The premium would depend upon the
  technology, high risk areas such as biotechnology
  and software would carry the higher premium."
