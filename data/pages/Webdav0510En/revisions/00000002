''19 Oct 2005 -- Sites like nosoftwarepatents.com, www.ffii.org and economic-majority.com need to be jointly edited online.  The protocol of choice for this is http-based webdav.  We need to get started.  Here are some informations on how to install and use webdav on FFII sites.''

== Experience on FFII.se ==

Authors at ffii.se use apache mod_dav and mozilla composer among other dav
clients. Mozilla composer works surprisingly well with advanced
style-sheets. MS Word and front page works too and windows can mount web-dav
as a drive. To use 'add-network-place' in windows - you need use '@' in the
user names in apache since windows otherwise adds a windows style domain
server affix to user names.

The trick is to separate server-side-includes or cgi-functions, so that they
are not overwritten with their results from execution. For this reason we have
created a dav.ffii.se site that enables DAV and disables SSI or other kinds of
server-executions.

== Subversion module, svn.swpat.ffii.org site ==

A very nice function would be to use i e the subversion module for web-dav and
check out changes to the www. site from the svn. site...

== Meta data ==

Web-dav also supports meta data properties.
