  Studie: Microsoft als Jobmotor
  http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/tol-10.12.03-002/

  Das Muenster Institute of Computational Economics (MICE) an der
  Universität Münster hatte im Auftrag von Microsoft Deutschland
  errechnet, dass sich bei den untersuchten Partnerunternehmen 11,2
  Milliarden Euro Umsatz auf die Verbindung mit Microsoft zurückführen
  lassen. Damit könnten jedem Euro Umsatz von Microsoft selbst rund 7,5
  Euro Umsatz bei den Partnern zugerechnet werden. Generell liege der
  Umsatz der Microsoft-Partner über dem Durchschnitt auf dem IT-Markt.

In these treatises you can find unmotivated and unsubstantiated
assertions about the importantce of patents for a "healthy software
industry" at serveral locations, e.g. on page 31 of the "OpenSource"
treatise.

In general the authors strive to adorn various Microsft PR assertions
with an aura of science without subjecting them to the test of
scientific scrutiny.

This study is reminiscent of a series of current attempts at
presenting "open source" as a communist phenomenon and software
patents as a necessary corollary of capitalism, thereby hoping to
achieve by means of ideologisation what can not be achieved by means
of more respectable scholarly methods.

The institute advertises its treatises as a scientific achievement on
its [http://mice.uni-muenster.de/ MICE front page].

It also advertises 
[http://mice.uni-muenster.de/software/index.htm proprietary MS-only software]
which it is developping for field of economics in order to
"help make economic theory more easily accessible to end-users".  Many
of the [http://mice.uni-muenster.de/presentations/index.htm articles]
written by MICE members revolve around this software

The MICE OpenSource treatise says that universities should not be
encouraged to develop free software and that such software tends to
cater to the taste of developers and to ignore the needs of
end-users.  However in science, peer review is important, and the
peers of the MICE developers are other developers, i.e. other
economists.  As the [http://mice.uni-muenster.de/about/index.htm MICE mission page]
says about the near future: 

  What we now call computational economics will be an integrated part
  of economics.

Making software proprietary means making economics proprietary, i.e.
removing science from peer review. 

Universities in Germany are currently under heavy pressure to finance
themselves.  At the same time there is a pressure from the scientific
community to allow peer review, i.e. open source development.  Some of
the researchers who are caught in the middle between these two demands
may tend to react nervously or to see monetary reward as the only
valid incentive for science, just as for software.

The main author of the studies, Dr. Stefan Kooths, is listed as head
of the

Dr. Kooths, has been parliamentary candidate of the liberal democratic
party (FDP) of North-Rhine-Westfalia, see

society should be determined by individuals subject to private
monetary incentives, and claiming that this belief system is related
to Mr. Kooth's background as a scholar in macro-economics.
