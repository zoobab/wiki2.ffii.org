''The automobile industry has sometimes been drawn into the software patent debate through the networks of corporate patent lawyers and large enterprises.  The IT departments of the same companies usually do not want software patents and have sometimes expressed this in public.''

=== Cigref 2003 ===

In June 2003, Jean-Pierre Courniou, R&D director of Renault and
president of the "Club Informatique des Grandes Entreprises
Fran√ßaises" (CIGREF = Computing Club of the Large French Companies)
declared software patents to be a great danger for the automobile
industry and summarised: "For me and for CIGREF, the response is: no,
we don't want patentability".  According to FFII's research, Volvo
owns far fewer software patents than Renault and is definitely on the
losing end of the software patent game in every respect.
