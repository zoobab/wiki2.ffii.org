''Brussels, 21 April 2005 --  The European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) has discussed the report of Michel Rocard MEP, the Parliament's rapporteur for the directive, about the software patent directive. Two days earlier Mr Rocard had delivered the report, which is notable for its clarity since in a few pages it explains the complex issue in an enlightening way.''

Mr. Rocard's report, titled "Note on the patentability of software
and of computer controlled inventions", presents the basic problem:
should software be pantented? If not, how to define a clear limit
which would exclude software from patentability while devices
controlled or assisted by software means would still be
patentable? Finally, the report proceeds to address every important
detail of the directive (title, definition of
technicity, compatibility with TRIPS, form of claims and
interoperability), arriving to conclusions that are very similar in
spirit to the Parliament's first reading.

During today's JURI meeting, the room was full of pro-software-patent
lobbyists who made their preferences audible by sneering and laughing.
The presence of these lobbyists, who all come from
the big industry, has been very intense the last few weeks at the
Parliament, whereas the voice of the !SMEs is barely heard.

Despite the
heavy lobbying, few MEPs opposed Rocard's approach. Among those who
particularly agreed were Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE), Maria Berger (PSE),
and Eva Lichtenberger (Greens).  At the end of the meeting, Rocard
said he was satisfied with the debate and that he agreed with 90% of
what the others had said.

JURI will take its final decision on June 20th, followed by the
Parliament's plenary vote around 6 July. 

== Comments ==

Harmut Pilch, President of the FFII:

    Rocard's outline contains all the necessary ingredients for a
    directive that achieves what most member state governments say
    they want to achieve: to exclude computer programs from
    patentability while allowing computer-controlled technical
    inventions to be patented. Already in the title of his paper,
    Rocard proposes to replace the misleading term
    "computer-implemented inventions" by "computer-controlled
    inventions", and the report itself goes to the heart of the
    matter.
    
    Rocard explains the difference between applied natural science and
    data processing, and, from there solves the legislative problem in
    a consistent and adequate manner, delivering what programmers,
    economists and the vast majority of companies in software and
    related industries want to see.  It is unusual for an economist
    and former French prime minister to take up a fairly special,
    difficult-to-communicate problem with such seriousness and moral
    courage.
    
    Perhaps Rocard is showing here the same qualities that won him
    fame as the peacemaker of New Caledonia. In any case, the contrast
    with the evasiveness of the Council's patent bureaucrats could not
    be greater.  If the MEPs can vote for Michel Rocard's amendments
    in June and July, the Parliament will then, in the ensuing
    Conciliation procedure, be able to negotiate with the Council from
    a position of strength. 
    
Gérald Sédrati-Dinet, vice president of FFII:

    JURI seems to agree with Rocard's view, which makes us hope that
    good amendments will be proposed.

Benjamin Henrion, FFII Member:

    It is clear that the big industry has started turbo lobbying since several days, 
    In the room, the number of pro-patent lobbyists from all big firms was also quite
    impressive, and I'm afraid of the influence they can have on some MEPs. The small
    enterprises and independent developers need to wake up as soon as possible.
