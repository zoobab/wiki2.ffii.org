= SME days on 14.-16.June =

On 14. to 16. June FFII organizes up to three days of lobbying for small and
medium-sized companies (SMEs) in the European Parliament.

It is important be cause this is the last week before the Legal Affairs
committee votes on the amendments which is decisive for the final outcome.

The program is flexible and depending on your travel requirements,
the times can be moved individually.

We will support you in travelling directions, Hotel and European Parliament
logistics, so you will be able to focus on your talks to your Members
of the European Parliament.

== Goal of this lobbying activity: ==
 
 1. Meet with the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and to explain the problems which software patents would cause to you.

 1. Make the MEP friendly to receive FFII voting recommendations which FFII will give to MEPs as soon as the amendments are final.

== Appointments: ==

It is neccesary to call MEPs for getting appointments. This should
preferably be done by a supporter from the respective member state
and the lobbying should concentrate on MEP offices of conservative
and liberal parties because they form the cruical groups, many of
these MEPs are heavvily lobbied and the direction which they will
take is not yet finally decided and it needs to be turned in the
right direction.

To make a stronger impression on the MEP, multiple Companies can
share one MEP meeting.

To prepare the coordinator of appointments for your country, send
him your company profile and tell him, for which days for you will
be in Brussels.

Appointment Coordinator for your Company:
<Add your name here or find somebody who can do it>

'''First: Travel and Accomodation'''

FFII supports participants regarding flights and train connections
as well as hotel booking.

All participants stay at hotels near the Place Rogier, a central place
of Brussels which is well-connected to all directions and has many
hotels around it.

We provide bookings (reservation) of Hotel rooms and propose the
following Hotels:

"Maison du Dragon" - features Chinese style and is regularily used by FFII.

"Hotel Belmont"    - new ***-Hotel, three blocks from the Dragon

Both hotels have wireless internet, the Belmont also has a Business
center, for both it is possible to get a price of 80 Euro at for
this week.

An URL with a pdf for pictures and hotel directions is at the
bottom of this mail.

'''Second: Accedidation to the parliament'''

You need your ID card or passport with you for accedidation to the
European Parliament. Otherwise it is not possible to get inside.

We'll organize accedidation, which needs an assistant of a MEP
to come down to the accredidation center and then all accedidations
can be done at once.

'''Third: Handouts and supportive materials'''

FFII will provide Handouts and supportive materials and is available
inside the European Parliament to answer questions and to attend your
meetings with your MEPs as well.

We prepared an A3-double-sided color handout which is folded to an
A4 folder. It presents testimonies from

and and more material which can be given to MEPs during and
after the meetings.
