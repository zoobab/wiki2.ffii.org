Letter from Pascal Lamy, EU Trade Commissioner


This year marks the tenth anniversary of the conclusion of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation. One of the most innovative aspects of this global trade agreement was the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Its conclusion laid the basis for a truly globalised intellectual property regime. At the same time, its implementation led to the emergence of important political debates in the WTO, notably on the impact of intellectual property on the developing world, access to medicines, and the protection of geographical indications. These debates are a reflection of the challenges of the global trading system regulated by the WTO.
In order to look back at these ten years and, more importantly, to examine the prospects for the future, I am organising a conference to be held in Brussels on 23-24 June 2004. This conference will bring together influential actors - from industrialists to government representatives, international organisations, NGOs and academics - with an interest in intellectual property world wide.  The aim is to assess from the widest possible number of perspectives the implications of the TRIPs Agreement and future trends and challenges in global intellectual property protection.
The Conference is meant to offer a high profile platform to address the key issues, such as the implications of the TRIPs Agreement for developing countries, enforcement challenges, the interplay between intellectual property and human rights, the relationship between intellectual property and the public domain and the question on whether the TRIPs Agreement is adequate to the challenges of globalisation and the knowledge society.
The conference will also enable us to examine issues which are not only of direct relevance to the global trading system, including the negotiations in the WTO under the Doha Development Agenda, but also to sustainable development, transfer of technology and research and development.
The event consists of four panels with high profile speakers, who will engage in an open debate in which the participants will be invited to participate actively.
I would very much like to invite you to attend this conference. Your participation is free of charge, but upon prior registration.
A draft programme of the conference is enclosed for your convenience.
I would kindly invite you to register by 4 June 2004 at the latest, using the electronic inscription form at http://scic.cec.eu.int/scic/owa/WEB_MTKF.reg_form?confID=04TRADETRIPS. I draw your attention to the fact that the number of participants is limited to 450, and that registrations will be treated on a first-come-first-serve basis.
Please follow carefully the instructions set out on the following pages.
I look forward to your reply and to seeing you on this occasion.
	Yours sincerely,



	Pascal LAMY
