Results show a high polarisation in voters, most of whom have voted for representatives of the party of the incumbent government. Although member of the PPE (which followed its extremely pro-patent shadow rapporteur [:SwpatjwuermelingEn: Wuermeling]), the governmental party, Nea Dimokratia, has voted against software patents in september 2003, following the lead of the group around [:PiiaNooraKauppiEn: Kauppi] (which included EPP groups from Finnland, Austria, Italy and other countries). As in other countries and parties, the minister sitting above the patent office did not oppose the pro-patent decision taken at the council of ministers. The previously ruling socialist party had been voting consistently pro-patent and election had been quite recent, so the ministrial decision might have been a result of being insufficiently prepared for such issues 
[:and :merely continuing the policies of the previous government or passively following the guidance of the civil servants from the patent office who represent greece in the council]. 

The communist party, clearly anti-software-patent, retained its seats, but some other leftwing parties lost seats. All in all, the situation did not change much in Greece.
