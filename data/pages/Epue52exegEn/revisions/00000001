== Art 52 EPC: Interpretation and Revision ==
The limits of what is patentable which were laid down in the European Patent Convention of 1973 have been eroded over the years. Influential patent courts have interpreted Art 52 in a way that renders it obscure and meaningless. Not all courts have followed this interpretation, and numerous law scholars have shown why it is not permissible. The EPO had accepted the inconsistencies in anticipation of an expected change of law. However this expectation was frustrated in 2000 by the governments and in 2003 by the European Parliament. The Parliament voted for a clarification which gives Art 52 back its meaning. Meanwhile, proponents from all sides have proposed to modify Art 52(3) EPC in one or the other way, of course while claiming that this merely serves to "clarify the status quo" or to implement a directive which serves this purpose, and, since the European Commission and the Council have not signalled support for the Parliament's approach, there is still no common understanding of which "status quo" we are talking about.

== Interpretation of Art 52 of the European Patent Convention regarding the question to what extent software is patentable ==
Dr. Karl Friedrich Lenz, professor for German and European Law at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, investigates which meaning has to be attributed to the text of Art 52 EPC today, using the various universally accepted methods of law interpretation, and reaches the conclusion that the Technical Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office have for some time now regularly granted patents on programs for computers as such and are showing a disturbing willingness to substitute their own value judgements for those of the legislator.
