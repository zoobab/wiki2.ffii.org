The German Ministry of Justice has issued a press release discussing today's events in Brussels, in which it signals openness toward further improvements of the Council's position.   So far the position of the ministry has been to insist on the political agreement of 18th of May and to relegate everything else to the later stages of the co-decision procedure.
This is not really a departure from that but leaves everything open for interpretation.

At the request of Poland, the EU presidency today adjourned the ratification
of its Common Position on a draft directive on the patentability of
computer-implemented inventions.  Poland had expressed a need for further
consultations. On 18 May 2004, the EU Competitiveness Council had
politically agreed upon a common position on the EU Commission's draft
directive, which was slated to be finally ratified today.

Germany's federal minister of justice, Brigitte Zypries, said:
"The German government had already achieved a lot with the political
agreement in May.  Nonetheless, we were well aware that the respective
compromise also has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of
arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European
Parliament. We will continue to work constructively toward finding a
solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the
decision taken in May of this year.  In that process, we will also introduce
the position meanwhiled formulated by the German parliament (Bundestag) into
the discussion in the Council."
