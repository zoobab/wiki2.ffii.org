[[http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep/owa/p_calag.meet_details?ipid=0&ilg=DE&idate=&igen=&iorg=C16&isorg=&iloc=&iclass=1&iorig=committees|On 2 or 3 February 2005]], the [[http://www.europarl.eu.int/committees/juri_home.htm|Committee for Legal Affairs of the European Parliament (JURI)]] will decide on whether the Parliament should have the option of returning to a 1st reading of the proposed software patent directive once the Council adopts a common position.  This decision must be taken before the Council's Position is transmitted to the Parliament.  We explain the procedure and present the arguments.

== Calendar ==

 * 2005-01-25 [[SwpatuniceEn| UNICE]] member associations ask their members to lobby against restart, arguing that Council position is good for them and EP will have difficulty in getting the required high majorities to seriously amend it in 2nd reading
 * 2005-01-24 [[Fish050124En| Software patents not on the Fishery Agenda]], the way for JURI is free again
 * 2005-01-19 [[Juri050119En| Commission attempts to preclude JURI decision on restart]] but fails due to Polish government's resistance
 * 2005-01-10 [[Restart0501En| restart motion of 61 MEPs]], rejected by EP tabling office in defiance of rule 55(4) and without an explanation (tabling office policy seems to be to strengthen the party groups)

 * You may want to read the [[http://kwiki.ffii.org/RestartGuide0501En|Lobbying guide for restarting the EU's legislative process on the software patent directive]], please always be polite and friendly (we have been forwarded some massmails that are sent to numerous MEPs at once, do not attempt to build any two-way communication and do not even mentioning the recipient MEP's names.  That creates a bad impression and may even make MEPs think "not again ... let's go straight through the 2nd reading, as quickly as possible, so that we don't get so much junkmail ..." )

== Write to non-legal affairs MEPs ==

Note that although [[http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/p_meps.short_list?ilg=EN&icom=C16|JURI]] only has members from at, cz, de, es, fi, fr, hu, it, lt, nl, pl, uk, you still can ask MEPs from your country to put the message through to them, this is also helpful to get a friendly climate in the groups when they discuss whether to put it on the agenda of JURI and the conference of presidents.

Moreover, it also might be helpful to write to the MEP you are in contact with in your place, he might put the message through.
