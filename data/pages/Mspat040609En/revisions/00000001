An new [http://www.developerpipeline.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=21401729 article] quotes 
free software leaders who express the fear that Microsoft is preparing to "use the broken
system of software patents to systematically attack its main competitors".

Eric Raymond, president of the Open Source Initiative, is quoted as saying:

  "We are very worried.
   This is aimed directly at us. 
   It's a classic Microsoft attempt to crush the competition." 

The article then quotes some people from Public Patent Foundation who explain that software patentability
is OK but the way it is implemented by the US Patent Office is not.

The article focusses the criticism on the alleged inability of patent offices of finding prior art and thereby
eliminating invalid patents, which it alleges can be gradually alleviated as patent offices learn to cope with
this "young technology".   The article fails to acknowledge that the ability of patents to harm free software is
unrelated to the question of whether these patents are obvious or not by the standards of the patent system.  In
fact Microsoft's greates potential for inflicting harm lies in its control of de-facto standards which are covered
by its patents.

The article cites the Public Patent Foundation in testimony of this kind of view, which
has been part of the patent propaganda in the United States for the last 20 years.  It appears from the article
that nobody in the US is currently pointing out that the cited problems are inevitable results of making software
patentable.  Even the Public Patent Foundation, of which Eben Moglen is a director, seems to be reinforcing propaganda
from the patent lobby.
