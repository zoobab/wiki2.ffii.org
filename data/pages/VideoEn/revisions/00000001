free video codec; Theora is a video 

Video is the technology of processing electronic signals representing moving pictures. A major application of video technology is television, but it is also widely used in engineering, scientific, manufacturing, and security applications. Other uses of video have tended to use the video formats designed for television use. 

Theora is still in developmental stages with Xiph.org having made three alpha releases thus far (Alpha One was released on September 25, 2002; Alpha Two was released half on December 16 and half on December 27, 2002; Alpha Three was released on March 20, 2004). The first beta release Beta-1 is expected later in 2004. Theora is released under the terms of a BSD-style license 


While VP3 is patented technology, On2 has irrevocably given royalty-free license of the VP3 patents to all of humanity, enabling the public to utilize Theora and other VP3-derived codecs for any imaginable purpose. 

In the Ogg multimedia framework, Theora provides a video layer, while Vorbis Vorbis is a completely open and free audio compression (codec) project from the Xiph.org Foundation. It is frequently used in conjunction with the Ogg container and is then called Ogg Vorbis.
