Parliament has done a lot of work on the directive, and with the right amendments passed, it ''could'' be amended to be not too bad.  The decision is therefore quite finely judged.  However, on balance, FFII believes that in the end a better legal text would be obtained by starting again with a clean sheet of paper.  It would also allow the time for more comprehensive economic research into the implications, and keep all of Europe's options open in the meantime.  The decision is a narrow one, but the need for a directive at this moment is not pressing.   There is therefore something to be said for taking time out to get it right.
