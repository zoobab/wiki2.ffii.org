Versucht Free Software und Open Source gegeneinander auszuspielen, denunziert Software-Patentgegner als Zeloten, und nutzt die negative Sympathie, die sich R.M. Stallman mit seinen manchmal etwas sehr konsequenten, egomanen Positionen zugezogen hat. Die beiden trafen sich auf einer Konferenz ("Software Patents: Good or Evil?" University of Maine School of Law, The Technology Law Center's 4th Annual Law and Technology Conference, 2003 (CLE))als Sprecher.

/* Software Patents: Final HERTS (Hypotheticals, Examples, Rants, Thoughts, and Stats) (Part 8)
Using open source software is a bit like reading Entertainment Weekly. Lots of people do it but few admit it. Plus other observations that didn't fit anywhere else.

Hypotheticals*/

''* Much of the fear about software patents is based on hypothetical situations. When the hypotheticals become test cases, there will be more to write about, more to debate. Until then, there are some very good conversations taking place on the Web about hypotheticals. '''''


Rants
/''' Freedom is for Zealots, Open is for Advocates (or Free Software vs. Open Software). 
Throughout this series of notes, I have been referring loosely to the "open source community," but there is considerable disagreement between factions in this community, especially in the context of free software vs. open source software. '''/

In a 1999 piece entitled "Shut Up And Show Them The Code," (http://catb.org/~esr/writings/shut-up-and-show-them.html), Eric S. Raymond describes the crux of the disagreement between the free software camp headed by Richard Stallman (RMS) and the Free Software Foundation, on the one hand, and the newer open source movement, on the other. 

''''' "The real disagreement between OSI and FSF, the real axis of discord between those who speak of 'open source' and 'free software', is not over principles. It's over tactics and rhetoric. The open-source movement is largely composed not of people who reject RMS's ideals, but rather of people who reject his rhetoric. '''''

/''' Others have characterized some in the open source community as zealots /*(http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/000055.html): 

"...the biggest liability for open source projects are neither software patents nor the "enemy" Microsoft, but zealots. these people feel that they somehow have the moral legitimacy to read from the open source scripture..." */


''*Red Hat has applied for patents on open-source-related technologies for (as they have said) purely defensive purposes (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1467). Many small start-ups get patents for the same reason, as there are many reasons to get a patent and some good reasons not to. *''

 Intellectual Property Committee
The Intellectual Property Committee's primary objective is to focus on intellectual property matters as they relate to the IEEE-USA membership (employed engineers, faculty, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, etc.), fast moving technology, technology transfer, and U.S. competitiveness.

IPC prepares testimony and position statements, drafts legislation, and delivers expert testimony before the U.S. Congress and the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
