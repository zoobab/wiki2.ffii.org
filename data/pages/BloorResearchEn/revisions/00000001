   * "The Open Source movement asserts that the EU Directive would stifle invention and developments. This is only an assertion or, put more gently, a prediction, as there are no historical facts to support the assertion. In turn, it is argued, it would lead to patenting of all inventions such as discoveries, mathematical formulae, rules, methods and business processes."
   * Perhaps, if the patenting process could be simplified through legal reform, streamlining the processes and reductions in registration costs, the Open Source movement may be persuaded to encourage inventors and innovators of all shapes and sizes.
