The EU is bringing in new rules on when patent licensing and other
technology-transfer agreements should and should not be allowed by competition
law:

  "Important changes have been proposed to the laws relating to technology 
  licensing agreements. Essentially, and in line with other areas such as 
  agency and distribution, the new law will concentrate on the actual 
  effect of the agreement entered into, rather than its form. Economic 
  concepts such as market share tests will become relevant, with all the 
  difficulties these will entail. This means that while the law should be 
  more effective in catching anti-competitive agreements, assessing 
  whether the law is complied with will be more difficult".
