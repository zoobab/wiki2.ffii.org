=== rough report - some keywords ===

==== 1st board ====

===== panelist #1: Mr Joao Neves, Intraneia =====
 * no value-added business, but support (though we have already created software and we still do, we consider ourselves being a support company)
 * create sw that really helps
 * consulting mainly small companies
 * mainly small projects
 * with swpat, we must close down

===== panelist #2: Mr Daniel Doll-Steinberg, Tribeka =====
 * we are inventive
 * 50 employees
 * 7 million UK-pounds invested by investors who where interested in a guarantee provided by swpat
 * 7 years development - no product yet, hence swpat necessary to guarantee return-of-investment
 * filed 3 patents
 * patents provide confidence
 * patents provide guarantee
 * big companies buy SMEs because of patents
 * Internal revenue service uses patents as an indicator of R&D.
 * Patents allow competing with other blocks (China, India, US, Japan).
 * Europe has innovations, but it's always the US that comercializes it.
 * software should of course not be patented, but the underlying processes
 * software is part of mental world
 * lawmaker should not decide for or against a certain business model - hence we need swpat to allow ours
 * We need cheaper patents for SMEs, cheaper dispute resolution.

===== panelist #3: Mr Andrea Nikolai, T6 =====
 * SME are 98% in number and 50% of GDP
 * There's a digital divide between SMEs and large companies.
 * There are for models for software: Software projects, Software publishing, Software subscription, Open Source Software

==== 2nd board ====

===== panelist #4: Mr Hintjens, iMatix Corporation =====

 * Programmer for more than 20 years, doing software R&D. 
 * Owner/founder of a highly innovative infrastructure building company. 
 * Ideas are cheap. Every smart person has brilliant ideas all the time.
 * iMatix is building middleware for a 200,000 people bank, that has to support 100,000 transactions/second.
 * The world lives and dies on cheap software. 
 * Copyright is strong protection and has worked well for iMatix.  
 * Patents are legal instruments used to attack innovative SMEs. 
 * If you approve software patents, you will destroy SME innovation and break our economies.

===== panelist #5: Mr Häkon Wium Lie, CTO, Opera Software =====

Founded in 1995. They had VC funding. He joined four years later. Opera has one product: Internet Browser. The most innovative technology they have is on small screen rendering.
Opera is against software patents.
Opera has software patents in the US for defensive reasons.

===== panelist #6: David Sant, European Patent Office =====
 * patents are indispensible guarantee and incentive
 * innovation breeds innovation via patents
 * patents balance public vs. private interests
 * p. provide jobs
 * EPO private studies: majority of registrants are SMEs
 * one patent registration costs 30000 EUR average, but only 13% go to EPO
 * SMEs are always at disadvantage
 * table comparing patents, copyright, no right
  my comment: implying FOSS would be "no right"
  my comment: why does copyright disclose anything in software? and why do patents do (no swpat)
 * copyright: change a small part to work around
 * patents are wide protection, while copyright is narrow
 * Question to the audience: "Why should differences in scope make patent protection per se objectionable?"
 * Question to the audience: two categories of CII: ABS patentable, but ??? (real swpat) not - where's the difference

Simon Gentry was not happy with the suggestion to use CAI (-Aided) for patentable inventions and software patents for the things nobody wants to patent.
