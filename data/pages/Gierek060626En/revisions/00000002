  Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission
 
  Contrary to what the Honourable Member suggests, the European
  patent litigation agreement (EPLA) proposal as well as the
  draft statute of the European Patent Court have been prepared
  by a group of countries party to the European Patent Convention
  (EPC) without any Community involvement. The EPLA would be an
  optional agreement to which EPC States could adhere if they so
  wish. It would apply to the litigation of European patents
  granted by the European Patent Office (EPO).

  The Commission is aware of the provisions to which the Honourable
  Member refers but it feels it is not appropriate to comment upon
  the current draft EPLA proposal as the Commission is not involved
  in the negotiation process. 

  The Commission is currently carrying out a broad consultation
  on future patent policy in Europe. The consultation document
  contains a chapter on the EPLA proposal and the potential
  Community involvement in its conclusion. 

  Generally speaking, it is imperative to ensure that the legally
  and technically difficult patent cases are dealt with by
  experienced and well qualified judges. The Commission believes
  that the above is a key requirement for the recruitment of
  patent judges. To that end, the Commission's own proposal of 23
  December 2003 for a Council Decision establishing the Community
  Patent Court(1) states in Article 2(2) of Annex [II] (contained
  in Article 4 of the proposal) that the candidates must have a
  high level of legal expertise in patent law. 

  Article 5 of Annex [II] (contained in Article 4 of the proposal)
  refers to a number of articles in the Statute of the European
  Court of Justice, inter alia, Article 18, which aims at ensuring
  the independence of the judges and prohibiting their involvement
  in cases in which they had previously taken part.
