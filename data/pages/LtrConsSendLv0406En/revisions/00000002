An Urgent Appeal was sent to Latvian Prime minister Indulis Emsis by Aigars Mahinovs (aigarius at laka.lv) from [[http://www.laka.lv|Latvian Open Source Association]] on the 1st of September 2004. The letter had also a 10 page Latvian explanation attached to it, describing exact problems with the directive (arguments were taken from FFII addendums to the appeal letter).
