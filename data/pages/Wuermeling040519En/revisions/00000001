The shadow rapporteur of the European People's Party, Joachim Wuermeling, issued a press release in which he
praises the Council's decision of 2004-05-18 as a "strong signal for innovation in Europe", saying that they
got it right, made ABS patentable while preventing a drift toward patentability of business methods and programs as such,
and thereby protected particularly software developpers and !SMEs from free-riding and idea-stealing.  The European Parliament had been misguided by an irrational campaign of panicmakers last september according to Wuermeling.
