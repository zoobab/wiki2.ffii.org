= Council Decisions are Changeable =

Talks with politologists and Brussels lobbyists independently confirmed that 
the heads of state do
sometimes reverse decisions of their ministers, especially in cases such
as that of 2004-05-18, where it appears that the decision taken by the
ministers did not reflect the viewpoints taken by the governments at home.

We need to research further and find case examples.

A list of examples to point to will help our friends everywhere to counter
the FUD that is likely to be launched in favor of the Irish "compromise".

Please talk to EU politics experts within your reach about this.
