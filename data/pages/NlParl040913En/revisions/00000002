We hereby send you the answers to the questions by MPs Van Dam (!PvdA)
and Gerkens (SP) w.r.t. software patents, which have been sent on August
30th bearing number 2030420290.

    1. Do you recall the answers to questions my MP Gerkens, dated
    August 2nd 2004?

Yes.

    2. Do you recall the Van Dam motion, requesting the government to
    act per today according to the position formulated by the
    Parliament, i.e. that the current proposal by the Council is no
    longer supported and do you recall your promise to carry out this
    motion?

    3. Do you recall the debate dated July 1st 2004 and more
    specifically, the last question by MP Gerkens and your answer to
    that?

    4. Do you share the opinion that the answers to the questions by MP
    Gerkens do not correspond with with your promise to notify your
    colleagues as soon as possible via a "note" of the changed Dutch
    position? Do you share the opinion that "as soon as possible" does
    not equate to "at the format acceptance of the Council's common
    position"? If not, why not?

    6. Do you recall your promise to inform the other member states that
    "the Netherlands are still concerned about, among which, the
    clarity on the scope of the proposed directive" and that this
    implies more than just informing the other member states of the
    position of the Parliament? If not, why not?

    7. Are you willing to put your promises into action and notify the
    other member states as soon as possible that the Netherlands no
    longer support the current proposal by the Council? If not, why not?

Yes, we recall the motion by Van Dam et al (Parliamentary file 21
501-30, nr. 52) which literally states: "The Parliament announces its
opinion that the political agreement that was reached at the
Competitiveness Council of May 17th and 18th 2004 does not sufficiently
provide measures to prevent excesses regarding software patents;
requests the government to inform other member states of this stance;
requests the government to act according to this stance during further
handling of Council's proposal and to discontinue support for the
current Council's proposal starting today". We also recall our promise
to support this motion.

Yes, we recall the debate dated July 1st 2004 in which mrs. Gerkens
asked to "inform colleagues as soon as possible (...) what the
Parliaments position is". In reply to this the State Secretary stated:
"I have to consider the method in which I should do this. E.g., a note
should be sent".

We disagree that the answers to questions by MP Gerkens (2030417710) do
not correspond do the promises during the debate. Shortly after the
acceptance of the motion dated July 1st we have had our permanent
representative at the EU announce, during the Coreper meeting of the
20th, that the Netherlands will have a unilateral declaration during the
formal acceptance of the common position of the Council later this fall,
in which the concerns of the Netherlands as stated in the motion, will
be expressed.

Via many contacts from foreign countries with the Netherlands we noted
that the message of the Dutch position is sufficiently known by the
other member states.

We also made use of the recent opportunity during initial meetings with
various commissions of the European Parliament to give notice of the
concerns of the Parliament. In various EP commissions we also gave
notice to the fact the the Netherlands, as chair of the Council, intends
to closely work with the EP to narrow the gap which currently exists
between Council and EP as a result of the first stage of the codecision
procedure. In that, a reference was made to various discussions in
various member states, in which explicit notions were made that the
Dutch Parliament is concerned about the preliminary directive.

It should be clear that the government does execute the motion by Van
Dam et al (Parliamentary file 21 501-30, nr. 52) and the promises made
during various discussions regarding this subject.

    5. Can the confirmation of the votes take place with another
    minister? If so, how will you make sure that the correct position is
    expressed by that minister? If not, why not?

The confirmation can take place at another Council than the
Competitiveness Council and chaired by another minister. As expressed
above the Netherlands will make a unilateral declaration during the
formal acceptance of the text of the common position of the Council,
in which the concerns of the Netherlands as stated in the motion, will
be expressed. Via existing coordinated structures care will be taken
that declaration is made even if the confirmation of the votes takes
place at a Council where both of us are absent.

Affairs
