In a recent book on "Leveraging IPR in the Communications Industry", Ilkka Rahnasto, Vice President and Director of IPR at Nokia Corporation, Finland, explains the characteristics of "defensive" vs "offensive" IPR strategies.  The latter, as practised by Nokia, include "strategic planning of the use of intellectual property rights in the business, proactive litigation of intellectual property rights and active lobbying for new intellectual property legislation."

The book "Intellectual Property Rights, External Effects, and Anti-trust Law - Leveraging !IPRs in the Communications Industry", by Ilkka Rahnasto, Vice President and Director of IPR at Nokia Corporation, Finland was published by OUP in Feb 2003 and is sold in UK at a price of Â£65.

The book is a candid discussion of the public pro's and con's of
strong IP rights in industries with powerful network effects, examined
through the prism of arguments presented in various legal
jurisdictions, and courts' reactions to them.

Here he sets the scene: in a world where products and services combine
different technical and creative components, IPRs are no longer just a
way of preventing direct copying -- they should be seen first and
foremost as a way for companies to influence other companies and how
they allocate their resources.

 p. 6:

 "One of the traditional views is that intellectual property rights are
 necessary for individual companies in order to protect their
 investment and to exclude imitations.  This may still be an important
 reason for business firms to rely on intellectual property
 protection. However, this book is based on the presumption that
 **intellectual property rights are strategially important because with
 patents and copyright is possible to control other firms' behaviour
 and influence the manner in which they allocate their resources**"
 (emphasis original)

 During the second half of the twentieth century, intellectual property
 rights were for a long time the cornerstone of the serial model of
 innovation.  Companies were developing their own products, authors
 were writing their own books and more recently software developers
 were writing their own computer programs.  From the social and
 economic perspective, it was desirable that those who were first in
 doing something were granted limited exclusivity to their results.  It
 was even concluded that it was desirable to encourage such activities,
 so it was clear that one should not deliberately copy what others were
 doing. Unless your strategy was based on copying of others' products,
 this conclusion was not partiularly interesting for anyone engaged in
 the development of business strategies.

 Consequently companies adopted either passive or active intellectual
 property strategies. A '''passive intellectual property strategy''' meant
 that the company adopted a strategy of investing in intellectual
 property rights as little as possible.  An '''active intellectual
 property strategy''' meant that the company was actively organizing the
 detection of new innovations, was patenting its innovations,
 protecting its trade marks, clearing new products against prior rights
 and attacking imitators.

 Since most of this had seldom any direct impact on the success of the
 company, it was not surprising, as one commentator identified, that
 patents were long considered to be an uninteresting subject for study
 and business strategy [13].  In many countries, copyright was
 similarly seen as only being a part of cultural policy, as the
 legislation was relevant only to the experts of collecting societies
 and media houses [14].

 The approach has changed.   Intellectual property rights have gained
 new popularity as ingredients of industrial policy.  At the same time,
 entirely proprietary product concepts are giving way to products and
 services that combine various technical and creative components.  A
 successful business strategy is increasingly based on intellectual
 property rights because through intellectual property rights it is
 possible increasingly to control the activities of other
 companies. Accordingly, companies are adopting either offensie or
 defensive intellectual property strategies.

 An '''offensive intellectual property strategy''' is based on strategic
 planning of the use of intellectual property rights in the business,
 proactive litigation of intellectual property rights and active
 lobbying for new intellectual property legislation.  A '''defensive
 intellectual property strategy''' is aimed at minimizing any effects the
 intellectual property strategies of others may have on the business of
 the company.

It is clear from this that Nokia itself is pursuing an "offensive IPR strategy".

This was also cited recently as a reason for an employee of Nokia to withdraw from the company: 

 * 2004-12-08 [http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2004-12.html#20041208b Lars Wirzenius: No Nokia] ("Before I joined Nokia I had formed an understanding that  Nokia was using and would be using its patent portfolio  defensively [..] the reality was quite horrible")

In recent years, [:SwpatsiemensEn: Siemens] has been engaging in and talking about the same kind of "offensive IPR strategy".
