 * [[http://www.dcita.gov.au/Printer_Friendly/0,,0_1-2_1-4_119706-LIVE_1,00.html|Goverment Response]] -- [[http://www.dcita.gov.au/|ICT ministry]] says AUSFTA is harmless because it wouldn't change current patent office practise (fails to address critics' concerns about "lock-in" of harmful judicial practise into law)

The US government and the Australian patent movement are trying to impose obligations for "strong IP protection" (including software and businesses method patents) on Australia by means of a "Free Trade Agreement".

While the government is pushing the Parliament toward ratification, some political analysts have voiced criticism.  The AUSFTA agreement seems to be becoming a focal point of Australia's movement for a free information infrastructure.

== Examples of patent-extremist provisions in AUSFTA 17.9  ==

  1. Each Party shall make patents available for any
  invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of
  technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an
  inventive step, and is capable of industrial
  application. The Parties confirm that patents shall be
  available for any new uses or methods of using a known
  product. For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat
  the terms "inventive step" and "capable of industrial
  application" as synonymous with the terms "non-obvious" and
  "useful", respectively.

  13. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is
  useful if it has a specific, substantial, and credible
  utility.

This imposes the US interpretation of the term "industrial",
thereby excluding the possibility of requiring that a
material product must be brought to the market.  This goes
further than the TRIPs treaty in imposing US
interpretations.  The only remaining means of excluding
immaterial innovation resides in the possibility of
interpreting the words "technical" and "invention".  However
the room for such interpretation is narrow.  The requirement
that patents shall be available "for any new uses or methods
of using a known product" sounds extremely broad and seems to
impose business methods.

Moreover the following clause seems to oblige Australia to move 
only toward unlimited patentability and not away from it. 
Patent lawyers can and will use this clause to oppose any
attempt at defining "technical" or "invention" more strictly
than is today the case in the most laxist caselaw:

  14. Each Party shall endeavour to reduce differences in law
  and practice between their respective systems, including in
  respect of differences in determining the rights to an
  invention, the prior art effect of applications for patents,
  and the division of an application containing multiple
  inventions.

It would be desirable to explicitely reserve the right of
both countries to reverse the unsupervised moves of their
judicial systems toward patenting the immaterial.

On the whole, the provisions of section 17.9 are characterised
by an interest in securing maximum rights for patent applicants
and minimum freedom for all others.
