= ePatents =
[[:SwideapatEn: software idea patents]]

Terminology used by [http://www.eurolinux.org Eurolinux Alliance] in their slogan as a replacement term for software patents.

"No ePatents"

The term tried to ride on the popular New Economy-Terminology (eCommerce, eBusiness, eMedia) where "e" stands for "Electronic". It was very popular and common back in the late 90th.


== Problem ==

 * People often don't get the message as they don't understand the small e. They read "No patents".

 * People don't get what ePatents are. Literally "Electronic patents" does not always remind you of Software Patents but of patents for electronic devices at large.
