''The Economic Majority project has taken off but needs to be structured and organised.''

== Current status  ==

draft by phm

 Currently I don't see anyone taking planning responsibility for the
 Economic-Majority project, so let me have a try.

 The following tasks seem urgent and responsibility is unclear for the most part.

 - The banner box pointing to the conference is outdated.
   It must be removed ASAP, even without replacement

 - Replacement by a "Thank You EP" banner and text
   would seem most appropriate.
   Miluz seems to be working on the banner.
   phm just drafted a quick "thank you" text

	 http://wiki.ffii.org/EmDank0507En

   which is better than nothing.

 - New supporters need to be registered every day via

	 http://www.economic-majority.com/admin/

   after they have confirmed their support by mail.
   The confirmations need to be again replied to in certain ways.
   This needs to be documented, and done every day.
   We need a team of people who take turns with this.
   Even if currently it is mostly uhlmann who does it, we need
   to get exercise in taking turns, so that uhlmann can go on vacation
   without creating a hole.    

 - Testimony collection must go on.
   The methodology for collecting, recruiting collectors and
   remunerating the work must also be updated in

	http://www.economic-majority.com/testimony/collect.php

 - Each FFII activist should care for a group of companies and be
   partially paid by this group.  Here again we must get started.
   phm might try to set up a group that supports the continued
   presence of erjos in Brussels, for a start.  erjos should then
   regularly communicate with this group of companies.  

   Activists are also encouraged to acquire new companies on their
   own and to then become responsible for and sponsored by these
   companies.

 - mvernon should be asked to come back and work on this.

 - aigarius seems ready to assume some responsibilities as well.

 - portuguese and slovenian translations of economic-majority.com
   seem to be in the pipeline and not taken care of.  Bernard.Lang@inria.fr
   sent an update of the French version.  phm would like to see 
   regular progress reports which say clearly whether these requests
   have been answered and what is still in the pipeline.
   Someone needs to be responsible for translation managment.

 - gregor.pirnaver@email.si / info@patenti.si asked for a link to his 

	 http://www.patenti.si/
	 http://programski.patenti.si/

   initiative in regio.php.

 - place an E-M ad in google.com, bid for the right keywords.

   Background: currently very many news headlines lead to a banner ad
   of pro-patent testimony site iinovate.org (by MS proxy ACT).
   Our banner could thus 

	 1 counter ACT misinformation 
	 2 persuade companies to support us



== To Do ==

 * set up a project group for this 
 * using the [:FeedbackEn: feedback system], ask corporate supporters about their companies, their concerns, their suggestions
 * discuss ffii plans with these supporters
 * discuss [:PatdbEn: patent database] with supporters, involve them in searching and documenting the EP situation in their field
 * try to motivate corporate supporters to donate more

 * FfiiprojEn
 * FFIISupportEn (Ideas, '''how''' the FFII could be supported)
 * Funding of events from Bundeszentrale fÃ¼r politische Bildung (--> [:Akkreditierung :FfiiAkkredDe]] or other Political Foundations. Usually data is needed for that such as bylaws, board structure, financial plan etc.
