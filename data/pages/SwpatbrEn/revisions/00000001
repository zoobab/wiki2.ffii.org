''The patent laws of most South American countries have been modelled on the European Patent Convention, and we can expect the movement for misinterpretation of Article 52 of that Convention to have its parallels in Brazil, possibly going through without anybody noticing.  On the other hand there is a strong climate in favor of free information infrastructures in Brazil.  This is only guessing, we need to document more.''
