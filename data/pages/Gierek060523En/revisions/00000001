  WRITTEN QUESTION P-2329/06
  by Adam Gierek (PSE)
  to the Commission

  Subject:    Interpretation of patent law

  According to the Commission's latest proposal concerning the European
  Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), there will be nothing to prevent staff
  of the European Patent Office (EPO), including members of the Boards of
  Appeal (BoAs), from becoming judges of the European Patent Judiciary (EPJ).
  
  This derives from the statute of the European Patent Court (Articles 2b and
  6.1).
  
  It is well known that, although the European Patent Convention (EPC) of
  1973 rules out the possibility of patenting computer programmes and
  business methods (Article 52(2)(c)), the current practice of the EPO runs
  counter to this.
  
  The aim of the EPLA is to harmonize the interpretation of the provisions of
  the EPC in states which are signatories to the agreement. However, it may
  be the case that the EPJ's interpretation with regard to the patentability
  of software is not in line with the criteria for patentability laid down by
  the EPC.
  
  In the light of the above, does the Commission agree with the view that
  judges from the European Patent Court should not be recruited from among
  staff of the European Patent Office?
