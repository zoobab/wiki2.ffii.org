Senator of the People's Party, Mercedes Coloma, said that the 18th of May text is "against innovation and competitiveness".

== Proinnova.org Press Release ==

Here's a rough translation of the more interesting parts of a press
release text from proinnova:

The Spanish Senate has approved unanimously a motion that insists to the
Government to reject the introduction of patents of software in Europe.

The initiative was taken by the senator of ICV Jordi Guillot, president of
the Commission of the Society of the Information and the Knowledge of the
Senate, that made in last December an interpellation insisting to the
Government to reject the director proposal on patents of software promoted by
the European Commission.

The Senate demands that the Government who works so that the future
director expresses of clear and unequivocal form the nonpatentabilidad of
software, and urges to him to that he engages in a dialog with all the
countries of the Union to obtain a new opposite majority to the proposal in
discussion in the Council of Competitiveness.

Senator Guillot justified his proposal assuring that the software patents
harm and distort the Society of the Information, and commented at this moment
on their opportunity, when several European national parliaments have rejected
the director proposal, and the European Parliament has requested its
retirement.

Other senators like Mercedes Coloma (PP), Felix Lavilla (PSOE), Aleixandre
Rose (CiU) and Xavier Albistur (PNV) also showed in their interventions before
the plenary session their clear rejection the proposal of director of the
Commission.

The director on software patents began her walking at the beginning of 2002,
when the European Commission proposed it with a writing that would suppose the
inclusion of the programs of software (which at the moment they have legal
protection under the legislation of author rights) within the scope of the
patentable thing.

So far the Commission has declined to comment if it is going to retire his
proposal or no.

Also, they ask the Government who takes advantage of the political support
that has received so that it demands in the Council the retirement of the
present proposal, and that in its place transacts a director who defines the
European Union clearly like a free territory of software patents, which without
a doubt would very positively affect our competitiveness and capacity of
innovation in the scope of the technologies of the information.

== Comment ==

It seems to ask both for restart (explicitly) and for B-item (implicitly,
since I see no other possibility to achieve a majority contrary to the
18th May text, in 2nd reading it would be a majority pro or against some
EP text, nothing to do with 18th May text, but maybe I'm interpreting it
too literally? ). It migh be seen as a request to try both ways and see
which one succeeds.


== Translation of the motion: ==
The motion passed with an amendment, this is the text that finally got unanimity:
(Original in the Spanish version of this page)

The senate calls on the government to defend, in the appropiate
instances in the EU:

1- to restart the procedure for the Directive of the European Parliament and
the Council on the patentability of computer implemented inventions.

2.- That the approved directive expresses clearly an unmistakably that
a computer program as such is not subject to the scope of patent law.
Reaffirming the government position contrary to the directive proposal
expressed in the Competitivity Council of the EU on May 18th 2004.

3.- to dialogue with UE state governments to achieve a new majority contrary
to the Council proposal of May 18th.

4.- to communicate this motion to the MEPs elected for Spain.
