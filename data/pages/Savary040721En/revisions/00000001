[:GillesSavaryFr: Gilles Savary], MEP of the French socialist group, sharply criticised the Irish Council presidency
for its [:Cons040518En: position on software patentability] in a speech during an
inagurating session of the new European Parliament, at which representatives from the
Commission and Council Presidency were present.

Audio/video recordings of the software patent-related part of his speech (original French version and dubbed English version) are available at

The English simultaneous translation of the first part seems to be rather poor.

== Transcription ==

My (jmaebe) own translation of the French version:

  The decision of the Competitiveness Council to revise the vote of the first reading
  by the European Parliament. Unfortunately, you have chosen there to revise a text
  which honoured the European Parliament, because it was in a certain sense a
  miracle of balance between the protection of the industry and the guarantee of
  the universality and equal access to programming languages and software.

  I think this is a very unfortunate situation. It's true that the ball is back in the
  camp of the European Parliament, but this goes to show an extremely narrow
  interpretation of the interests of the industrial lobby.

He then finishes by stating that the Irish presidency was technically very strong, but scored lower in social areas (before this fragment, he also talked about the Commission/Council's ignoring of the EP in the case of giving passenger data to the US).
