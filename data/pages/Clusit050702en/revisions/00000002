''Milan, 30 June 2005 -- CLUSIT, the Italian Association for Computer Security, representing 400 companies, calls on Italian members of the European to oppose software patentability in its upcoming vote of July 6th.''

The [[http://www.clusit.it/|CLUSIT]] press statement says:

 Milan, 30  June 2005 -- In view  of the forthcoming  European Parliament
 voting scheduled to happen on the 6th of July, Clusit stands against all
 software  patenting  positions.   Clusit,  the Italian  Association  for
 Computer Security, represents more  than 400 companies and organisations
 playing  a significant role  in the  Italian economy.   Clusit maintains
 that software patents hinder the development of adequate security sytems
 and  open standards, which are  enriched and  strenghtened by  the joint
 effort of a high number of contributors.

 An open approach is the answer  to the security challenges we foresee in
 the near  future.  Only  the cooperative effort  of multiple  actors can
 adequately protect the networks and the systems on which our country and
 the whole Europe base their future upon, and ensuring integration easily
 and, above all, quick  adoption of effective and shared countermeasures.

[[HartmutPilchEn| Hartmut Pilch]]: CLUSIT should write to Italian !MEPs and ask them to support the [[AmPlenPr050701En| 21 cross-party amendments]] filed by Buzek, Rocard, Duff and many other MEPs from all groups.   If these are supported by 367 votes, all options remain open and there is a chance that the wishes of CLUSIT will be fulfilled.  Failure to fully support these amendments will at best lead to Conciliation based on inconsistent positions, at worst to the entry into force of a directive that imposes unlimited patentability on Europe.
