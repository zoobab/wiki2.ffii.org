== Not on the Council Competitivness Council agenda of 2004-11-25/26 ==

In the coreper document the approval of the directive is not mentioned as a subject of discussions.

 At its meeting on the 11th of November the Working Party on Competitiveness and Growth
 (High Level) had an exchange of views on the Competitiveness Package 20041 2 and the Kok
 report. Building upon this exchange of views, this note highlights key issues for the initial
 discussion by ministers of these two agenda items at the Competitiveness Council of 25 and
 26 November 2004.

Software Patents are not discussed at the Competive Council meeting. Esp. after the Polish position became public a further delay is possible.
