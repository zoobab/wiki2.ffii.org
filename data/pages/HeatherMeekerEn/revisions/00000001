Heather J. Meeker is Us patent attorney, uninitiated in the EU debate. In February 2005 she wrote an opinion piece for the controverse Online-magazine !LinuxInsider "The Fuzzy Software Patent Debate Rages On" in which she defends the interests of her business. For EU readers her tone sounds arogant. !LinuxInsider is a magazine which intends to stir contoversy and is used as a counterforce to Groklaw in the US SCO vs. IBM case. 

=== US criticism vs. corporate interests? ===

- She advocates that business interests were in favour of patents (opinions of !CEOs) and attacks Us support for the EU debate. 

- underestimates the EU movement: "But the decision may have been swayed by an eleventh-hour public relations pitch against the directive by open-source spokesmen from the United States."

- in the patent professionals world: ivory tower -> "fraught with partisan rhetorics"

=== Objections agains I2P ===

- Copyright infringement difficult to proof. "Wrong Direction" 

- rewrite argument against patents vs. copyright: "But people using software to develop products rarely copy software without modification. If they re-write code, they can come up with a very different looking set of expression that performs the same function. Have they infringed the copyright? That is not so straightforward."

- quality for copyright was not an issue while patents get examined.

=== Reversed burden of proof ===

- "it's only fair to articulate why software patents are worse than any other patents."

=== USPTO ===
- prior art vaccuum in the US as Prior art research relies on filed patents.

-  Business method patenting as an income source of the PTO: "The USPTO is historically underfunded, and budget deficits and the skyrocketing number of software and business method patent applications have not helped. "

== Her question ==

 "So, what I would like anti-patent [?!] activists to consider is this:
  Are software patents really a bad idea? Or just a good idea, badly executed? 
 Or a good idea, executed as well as good ideas tend to get executed in the
 real world?"

=== Answer: Rebentisch, FFII   ===
  Software patents are an inappropriate instrument in the field of software. 
  They benefit patent professionals like Heather J. Meeker. However,  
  patent professionals lack economic expertise and competence to decide on 
  the scope of patent law. They interfere as partisan stakeholders. And her 
  ivory tower community (as she calls it) drafted the directive for the benefit
  of their own business. We apply the FCN-Test (fast, cheap, narrow) and favour 
  a copyright style regime. We are the persons targeted by the law, we know our 
  business and reject an ursupative reversal of the burden of proof. 
  Show us the good software patents first! Then we could start to talk about 
  "good software patents". We think that traditional patents which pass the natural 
  forces test are justified or accepted at the market. The EU parliament suggested 
  a good draft with such criteria. Data processing is no field of technology in the
  meaning of patent law and shall not be covered by patents. Patent law is not good 
  or bad. It is an instrument of economic policy which you should not apply to fields 
  where the costs exceed the benefits. Patent law is a strong instrument from an 
  economist' perspective as it interferes in the Free Market, so we have to be very careful.
  Current patent practice is not the best of all worlds but needs review. 
  The FTC report and several other studies indicated the need for reform in the USA.
