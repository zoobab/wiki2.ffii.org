== General criticism ==

 * 2005-04-12 EN [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec6.html?ca=dgr-lnxw07NaturalStandards IBM/Seebach: Naturally occurring standards, patents are a huge weakness for a standard.]

 for instance, Unisys had a patent governing a bit of the algorithm used for GIF images. In general, patents are a huge weakness    
 for a standard. The MP3 standard is used very widely by people who simply don't know -- or don't care -- that someone 
 theoretically has a patent on part of it, and only some code using the patented algorithm actually has a license from the 
 patent holder. Developers and users can be bitten by this many years after they make the design decision to use a patented 
 algorithm, due to the nature of patents (see Resources). De jure standards often require contributors to clearly disclose any 
 known patents; de facto standards generally have no way to do this.
