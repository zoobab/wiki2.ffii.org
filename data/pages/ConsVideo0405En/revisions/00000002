FFII will pay a prize of 1000 EUR to the best realisation of an animated presentation or digital movie on EU software patent lawmaking. We are calling on donors and sponsors to add money to the prize sum. Ultimately we need video material that can be used by tv or in introductory presentations. The deadline is 2004-07-31.
