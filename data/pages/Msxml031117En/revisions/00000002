Microsoft may have patents and/or patent applications that are
necessary for you to license in order to make, sell, or distribute
software programs that read or write files that comply with the
Microsoft specifications for the Office Schemas.

So usage of MS Word XML files requires a patentlicense:

  You are not licensed to distribute a Licensed Implementation under
  license terms and conditions that prohibit the terms and conditions of
  this license.  You are not licensed to sublicense or transfer your
  rights.

The licence is royalty free, but GPL ยง7 requires the right to
sublicence patent rights to the people who obtain a GPL program from
you.

This shows how important it is to ensure that the software patent
directive has 
[[EubsaItopEn| articles that protect interoperation from consituting patent infringment]]..
