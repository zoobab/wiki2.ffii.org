In 2004 the UK Department for Education and Skills (!DfES) sought to challenge a software patent EP 0664061 held by Bromcom/Frontline Technology on transmitting student data by wireless network.  !DfES achieved partial success in June 2004, and settled with Frontline at the end of 2005, after the software patent directive was rejected.

== Outline ==
[[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-uk/2004-07/msg00022.html|summarized the Government guidance James Heald]]
as follows: ''Although claim 7 of the patent was upheld (regarding use of Bromcom's wireless protocol),''
''the Government is advising that WiFi does not infringe, regardless of the software package.''

The  [[http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/tools/ims/patent/|Department for Education & Skills statement]] on the case says:

  "The judgment following the patent action trial was handed down today. 
  The Department is pleased that it has substantially won its case and 
  achieved its purpose in taking this action. More detailed guidance on 
  the practical application of the judgment is being prepared and this
  will be published as soon as possible. Copies of the judgment will be
  available through the Courts Service."

[[http://www.frontline-technology.com/|Frontline Technology]] says on its front page

  "We are pleased that the inventiveness of the FTL patent has been upheld. 
  This is despite the fact that the judge found the patent to be partially invalid.

  We are also pleased that the vast majority of the grounds of attack made by the 
  Department were thrown out by the court. "

This was later changed to

  "We are pleased that the inventiveness of the Frontline patent (European Patent: 
  EP 0664 061) has been upheld and DfES have failed to overturn the Patent

  We are also pleased that the vast majority of the grounds of attack made by the
  Department were thrown out by the court. This is despite the fact that the judge
  found two of the claims to be invalid."

It carries on thus:

  "We will be studying the judgement and its implications with our advisers.

  More details on the practical implications of the judgement will be published
  on this web site as soon as possible.

  Patents for the same invention remain valid in their original form in Australia, 
  Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the 
  United States of America."

Has there ever been an attempt at enforcing them?

More on the case comes from [[http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2004/06/truancy-patent-goes-missing-in-part.html|IPKat]], 
which specifically notes that core Claims 1 & 2 were revoked.

Interesting spin by Frontline. Maybe it's true that the "vast majority of the grounds of attack" were rejected, but if a single argument against is held valid, that could demolish the patent, or at least make it so narrow as to be useless.

RMS-style deconstructions of [[http://www.cgce.net/frontline_patent/abstract_a.txt|abstract]] and  [[http://www.cgce.net/frontline_patent/claims_a.txt|claims]].

The !DfES has now issued [[http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:4YDkt-jZwgoJ:www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/7078/Patent%2520advice%2520to%2520schools%252020%2520July%252004.doc&hl=en|guidance]] to schools, basically saying that a school running a wireless network using standard non-specialist wi-fi equipment (conforming to 802.11a, 802.11b or 802.11g standards) would not be infringing the Frontline patent.
