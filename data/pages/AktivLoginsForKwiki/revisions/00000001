= Automatic transfer of Aktiv user logins for Kwiki Editor use =

People whom we want to enable to write-protect Kwiki pages or edit and see private Kwiki pages should be listed in 
 /var/www/adm/bin/kwiki-editors

After you added someone's Aktiv user name to /var/www/adm/bin/kwiki-editors, you must run the Perl script
 /var/www/adm/bin/aktivpw2kwiki
Immediately thereafter, the user will be able to log in as Kwiki Editor, using their Aktiv login.

Users that do not have an Aktiv login are skipped and reported by the script.

Remark: There really should be a better place for this than ''var/www/adm/bin'' - which one?
