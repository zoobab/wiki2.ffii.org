In a letter, on 2004-08-24, the french president's technical adviser answers to Urgent Appeal:

               Mister the Vice-Président,

               In a letter dated on August 2004 the 5th, you have drawn the attention of Mr. the
  President of the Republic to your concerns concerning the European draft Directive about
  software patents.

               Being very sensitive to your concerns, the Head of the State has charged me with the
  responsibility to thank you for your letter and to answer you.

               As you know it, France supported the Irish compromise but matched its vote of a
  declaration pointing out the goals which it intends to pursue, namely a clear framing of the
  patentability of software which puts an end to the drifts of the EPO.

               Would that point not be reached in the selected text, it would be advisable
  to return there with the assistance of the European Parliament.

               Sincerely yours

                                                                     Stéphane DUPRÉ LA TOUR
