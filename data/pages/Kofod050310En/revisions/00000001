''10 March 2005 -- According to an article in the Danish newspaper Politiken, the Danish Social Democrats will not punish his disobedience against the Parliament at Monday's EU Council meeting any further. His behaviour was criticized by socialists, social liberals and the Danish Peoples Party, opening the possibility of a no confidence vote had the social democrats backed it.''

Selected translated quote:

 "A majority outside of government had obliged Bendtsen to block a
  no-debate vote on the directive at the EU Council of Ministers meeting
  but this didn't happen.

  According to the Social Democrats the minister did fight monday to
  have the directive postponed in the EU Council  of Ministers but
  lacked backup from other countries.

  This is stated by Social Democrat EU spokesman Jeppe Kofod after a
  hearing with the minister thursday morning in the Parliamentary EU
  Committee."
