''News organs often lack the competence and confidence to write about software patents and other subjects of interest to the FFII.  We need to be ready to explain things and to provide usable pieces of text and graphics.  Inquiries from media and potential volunteers are answered by the media helpdesk media-help at ffii org.''

== Objectives ==

 * watch the media: 
   * subscribe to [[http://www.ffii.org/assoc/knecht/watch/|UrlWatch]]
   * http://news.google.com, search for keywords such as "software, patents"
 * encourage the media to take up information infrastructure themes more regularly (the main reason that such themes are not in the media is a shortage of educated journalists, not disinterest of the readers)
 * find out and document who the interested journalists are, what they need from us 
 * investigate into misinformation campaigns of the Commission et al (e.g. regular false claims about contents of their proposals and through which channels they are propagated into the media)
   * complain to [[EuroOmbudsmanEn| EU Ombudsman]] and organisations for journalistic ethics as well as watchdogs that look at media abuse by administrations
 * help our helpers to talk to the media
   * make sure the core data are in our repr database and accessible to the http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en system, so that supporters can more easily participate in the work
 * make sure the interested journalists are on our [[http://lists.ffii.org/listinfo/news/|news mailing list]] and on more specific news lists where applicable
 * push current !PRs to the media
 * directly communicate with some journalists regularly
   * write short mails that point to whatever info FFII can offer, publish these as letter templates here
 * write articles or text modules that journalists or editors can directly use
 * make sure we can make best use of media channels
   * find out prices and conditions for pushing !PRs to media (e.g. OTS)
   * find out prices and conditions for advertising in media
     * [[http://www.ffii.org/proj/media/parlmag/|Parliament Magazine]]
 * write documents (!FAQs) that answer questions of journalists and of people willing to help
