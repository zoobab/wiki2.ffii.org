Answers to questions (question number 2030417710) member of parliament
Gerkens (SP).

'''1) Did you note the article ''Europe's software patent under siege''?'''

Yes, I noted the this article in the Herald Tribune of July 7th, 2004.

'''2) Is it true that the mentioned spokesperson of the Dutch EU mission is of the opinion that the Netherlands don't need to inform other members states on how the Netherlands are supposed to have voted on the softwarepatent proposal?'''

'''3) How does this relate to your explicit promise during the VAO (4) on softwarepatents on July 30th that the Netherlands would as soon as possible let the other member states know that the Netherlands would withhold.'''

Like promised before, the government will execute the motion-Van Dam
cs. (Kamerstuk 21 501-30, nr. 52) as passed on July 1st, 2004 by the
Tweede Kamer. On July 20th the Dutch Permanent Representative at the
EU in Coreper announced that the Netherlands will, at the time of the
formal passing of the text of the common position of the Council, add
a statement to the decision, wherein the position of the Tweede Kamer,
with respect to the guarantees that the directive text of the Council
provides against excesses with respect to computer implemented
inventions, will be further explained. Also will be stated that these
worries will be taken into consideration by the Netherlands at the
further treatment of the directive in second reading. The cabinet is
primarily concerned that a directive will come about in the end, that
on the one hand leads to harmonization of regulations, and on the
other hand prevents possible excesses.

To achieve this we we will act upon promises made to the Tweede
Kamer. As EU presidency we will promote good communication between the
European Parliament and the Council. In September will be the first
deliberation with relevant commissions of the European Parliament.
Also, the State Secretary of Economic Affairs, if possible in
cooperation with the !InnovatiePlatform (5), will organize a
deliberation with for this dossier important parties. The Tweede Kamer
will be informed about the results.

'''4) Can you answer these questions within a week?'''

Unfortunately because of the holiday period that is not possible.
