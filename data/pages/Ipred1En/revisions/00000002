Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of
intellectual property rights
PE-CONS 3636/04 PI 33 CODEC 354 OC 224
+ COR 1 (sv)

The Council approved the amendments contained in the European Parliament's Opinion
and decided to adopt the act as amended with the Austrian, Belgian and Italian
delegations abstaining. (Legal basis: Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community).

20. Commission statement

"The Commission considers that effective action against counterfeit and piracy requires
criminal sanctions for serious infringements which are intentional and committed for
commercial purposes. It also considers, in line with Article 20 of its original proposal,
that where necessary to achieve a Community objective, such measures may be adopted
under the powers conferred for the purposes of achieving the aims set out in Article 95
of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Consequently, the Commission
will examine the possibility to propose in due course further measures providing for
criminal sanctions in this field."
