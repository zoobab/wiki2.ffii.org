''20 March 2005 -- A petition in Estonia against software patents has gathered 1200 signatures in 2 days.   The Estonian text has meanwhile been translated to English.  Hartmut Pilch of FFII finds that it would have been better to present a short petition text with links to existing documentation on the problems of software patents.''

   Dear Member of the European Parliament,

   The objective of this letter is to express our concern regarding the
   Directive on Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, which
   is planned to be adopted in the European Union and which is better
   known in IT-circles as the `Software Patents Directive'. 

It is also better known under this name in the European Parliament.

   More information on the official process of debates and discussions related
   to the draft Directive can be obtained at the European Parliament web
   portal [[5]1].

   In this letter, we are going to present our position and rationale in
   that matter, hoping that in the European Parliament, you will
   represent the interests of small enterprises and software developers
   of Estonia and the entirety of Europe and stand against the adoption
   of the Software Patents Directive in its present formulation.

   The European Parliament has already expressed its position regarding
   the above-mentioned Directive by making several amendments in the
   draft in September 2003 [[6]2] to restrict outright patenting of
   trivial technical solutions and establish reasonable requirements for
   issuing patents.

There were about 120 amendments, and triviality was not an issue.  In particular,
there is nothing in the amendments that would prevent trivial technical solutions
from being patented.  Rather, many amendments were about defining "technical"
in such terms that software is excluded.

   By today, the Council of the European Union has reviewed the proposals
   and offered a so-called `compromise'. The activities of the Council
   and the Commission in working with the Directive have become an object
   of criticism on several occasions. There have been repeated attempts
   of pressure to speed up the adoption of the Directive by using
   questionable procedures and ignoring the recommendations of the
   Committee on Legal Affairs as well as the Plenary Session of the
   European Parliament to abandon the draft and reinitiate the
   proceedings from the beginning.

   Despite the protests of many varied interest groups, the draft has
   been adopted by the Commission and is awaiting the approval of the
   European Parliament.

The draft was not adopted by the Commission but by the Council, and there
was nothing particularly wrong with that, nor was the process too speedy.
The text here fails to point out in what way the Council and Commission 
misbehaved.

   In reality, the `compromise' version of the draft is in no close way
   related to the amendments recommended by the European Parliament and,
   as such, neither represents the interests of the undersigned nor the
   majority of European smaller entrepreneurs and software developers
   [[7]3] [[8]4]. 

The word "compromise" refers to "compromise between member states", not
to "compromise between Council and Parliament".  Again, the criticism
is directed to the wrong place.

   We are of the position that the Directive to be adopted
   should:

     * be based on clear and transparent reasoning on the necessity of
       software patents in the European Union, particularly from the
       viewpoint of small and medium-sized enterprises. We do not know of
       any studies that have provided adequate justification for the
       necessity of software patents from the aspects of economy or
       innovation; however, there have been several studies stating the
       contrary [[9]5].

It's good to point that out, but the following text on why software
patents are bad is not really needed.  There is widespread consensus
that software patents are undesirable, but there is confusion about
what software patents are and why the Council text does not exclude
them, in spite of pretending to do so.

       We should like to direct your attention to the fact that in the
       field of information technology, innovation and development are

"information technolgy" is a bad term, especially in the patent context,
where it triggers the notion of patentability.  The EP has stated that
"Data processing is not a field of technology in the sense of patent law".

       based on cooperation and on the improvement of existing solutions,
       not on projects developed behind closed doors. 

Projects developped behind closed doors also make important contributions,
and they are also harmed by patents.  The open-source vs closed-source
distinction is not really pertinent in the context of the patent question,
and it is often used by patent proponents to confuse the issues and create
the impression that the patent opponents are a kind of social utopians and
iconoclasts who don't want to allow proprietary development models.  This
letter supports that error.

       In recent years,
       one of the fastest-developing technologies, the freely

Again "technology" is a bad word.

       distributable open-source Linux operating system, which was born
       in 1991 on the home computer of a young student in Helsinki, has
       been able to develop particularly because of the absence of
       restrictions. The same can be said about almost all of modern
       everyday solutions, including the Internet, e-mail and the World
       Wide Web. Legalisation of software patents in the presently
       intended form reflects the economic interests of larger
       corporations

This statement is questionable.

Many large corporations have protested against software patentability or
kept a low profile, and those that advocated it are usually not putting
forward any clear arguments.  It should not be assumed in absence of
a clear case that software patents are in the interest of anybody.

       but it would decrease the opportunities for small
       entrepreneurs and private individuals to be involved in software
       development. It is important to point out that throughout the
       history of information technology, monumental innovations have
       resulted particularly from cooperation between private
       individuals.
       Software patents will also enable the operation of `patent

Software patents already do that.

Many software patents have been granted by the European Patent Office,
and some are being used by patent sharks to attack European companies.

       sharks', i.e. business operators who do not produce anything but
       who have acquired various trivial patents. Without any product to
       sell, they are protected from all claims while still being able to
       establish their requirements against all software producers who
       use solutions covered by such patents (and whose number will
       probably include the majority of software developers regardless of
       their field of activity -- more about this in the next point).
       Such business will obstruct any innovation and offend the sense of
       justice of people working in the area of IT as well as many other
       citizens;

     * preclude the possibility of patenting such solutions, algorithms
       and methods which can be described only and purely as software.

Again, this is a very unclear and imprecise instruction for !MEPs.
It doesn't tell them which amendments to uphold.  And the following reasoning
is again redundant in such a letter.

       Unlike manufacturing industries or medicine, where one product is
       usually tied to one patent, in modern software industry every
       program is composed, due to the more abstract and mathematical
       nature of information technology, of thousands of different
       components, all of which may use patented solutions. This brings
       about several problems specific to software:

The claim that these problems are specific to software is quite easy
to attack and not necessary.
 
          + firstly, small software developers will be deprived of any
            realistic chance to keep themselves in touch with all patents
            related to their software, and software development will
            begin to resemble walking in a minefield, where they will
            never know whether or not another line in their code will
            result in costly legal proceedings;

          + secondly, the prices of software using licensed technologies
            may well become astronomical because each patent owner will
            want to receive a part of the sales proceeds. Until now,
            patents have often been licensed under a scheme by which the
            patent owner is paid a certain percentage of the amounts
            received from sales. It is easy to predict a situation in
            which the software developer will be forced to pay licence
            fees exceeding 100 percent of the sales proceeds due to the
            great number of patented technologies in one software
            program;

     * if the Directive nevertheless enables the patenting of file
       formats and communication protocols, ensure full and explicit
       rights to develop competing products compatible with the patented
       formats without any requirement to pay licence fees. 

This again is abstract and vague, not a clear instruction.  And it assumes
without justification that the Parliament will fail to uphold its amendments
of September 2003.  It spreads a kind of panic atmosphere.

       The
       development of today's computer networks has been possible only
       because of the base protocols and data-exchange standards being
       open and free from the weight of patents. When all rights to a
       communication protocol are privately owned, the open Internet and
       other channels of data exchange may turn into closed and
       fragmented environments controlled by different interest groups.
       Another danger stemming from the patenting of data-exchange
       standards is constituted by the possibility of placing the users
       in a situation in which using a certain software application is a
       pre-requisite for carrying out certain elementary operations (e.g.
       using electronic citizen services) and the development of
       alternative software is limited by the control of the patent
       owner;

     * limit the validity period of patents in the area of information
       technology. 

This is in violation of Art 32 TRIPs which requires 20 years of
duration for all patents.

       In the situation in which an average software product
       has a useful life of five years, the respective patents should not
       be valid for a substantially longer period. Each patent will not
       only restrict the development of one software application but,
       rather, the development of the entire area of software of similar
       functionality;

     * establish clear and strict rules on the examination of patent
       applications related to information technology. 

Again an abstract and unfulfillable requirement that spreads defeatism
without reason.  The parliament can not establish such rules.

       The practice has
       shown numerous examples of patents issued without any background
       research and covering solutions which are obvious to any computer
       expert and which often have already been in use for a long time
       [[10]6] (inter alia, there are patents covering the Internet
       hyperlinks, which take the user from one webpage to another).
       Although it is possible to revoke such patents in court, this will
       be far beyond the resources of most small or private software
       developers and will, all in all, remarkably increase the costs
       relating to software development, thus being outright contrary to
       the original purpose of patents, which is to protect innovative
       solutions.

What follows consists again of statements about reality which very few
of the signators are able to verify.  It is thus easy to dismiss.

   In summary, we should like to point out that practice related to
   software patents has shown that patents are acquired by, first of all,
   large companies, who cross-license those patents with other large
   companies. There will be no choice for small producers, whose
   interests should theoretically be protected by patents. Since,
   inevitably, such small producers' software applications use methods
   already covered by patents, these producers are, in turn, forced to
   cross-license their patents with the large companies, thereby losing
   any advantages that would have been otherwise provided by the patent.

   There should also be consideration of the fact that if software
   patents are legalised, European entrepreneurs will have to pay a large
   if not major part of the licence fees directly or indirectly to patent
   owners in the United States of America. As a result, the
   competitiveness of the entirety of European information technology on
   the world market will be compromised.

Again speculation, probably true, but unsubstantiated and not
substantiatable by the signators.

   Regarding software one cannot apply the same rules as are applicable
   for the manufacturing industry and we, the undersigned, are convinced
   that the existing copyright laws already provide sufficient protection
   for software developers. Additional patent legislation would only
   further concentrate the software market into the hands of a few
   companies, provide favourable conditions for monopolies and retard the
   progress of the whole area of information technology.

   We hope that we have succeeded in explaining our positions to you and
   that you will help to protect the free development of European
   information technology.

   Thank you in advance.

In general this letter is too long, and it is not adapted to the situation, where the second reading has not started and the parliament faces a few more options, such as
 * questioning the validity of the "Common Position", [:LtrFfiiCons050308En: asking the Council to clarify what happened on 2005-03-07]
 * rejecting the Council's proposal 
 * adopting the September 2003 amendments without much change.

It is a good idea to start a local intitiative and gain supporters for it by a petition.  But petitions should be short and focussed on a few essential statements that the authors are able to verify, together with demands that directly reflect the interests of the signatories (e.g. rights to be safeguarded).  For the detailed argumentation, one can point to background documentation.  Good indtroductory material in Estonian exists at http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/.

## Holger Blasum adds: "The above analysis shows that drafting a perfectly sound petition is not easy, especially if the text is long. Nonetheless, given that a petition can serve as a door-opener for further political discussion, if the above points are kept in mind, I would like to acknowledge that those who took the initiative to start the petition have done a good step from a practical point of view."
