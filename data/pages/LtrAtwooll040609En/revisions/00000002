Compared to her [[LtrAtwooll040604En| previous letter]] a few days earlier,
this letter from Elspeth Atwooll seems a lot more aware of the 'weakness' of the 
Council text, and asks for help in finding suitable wording to fix it.

  Thank you for your email regarding my personal position and that
  of the Liberal Democrat party on the proposed EU Directive on the
  patentability of computer-implemented inventions. On my understanding,
  the purpose of the Directive is to regulate the patenting of things
  like mobile phones, robots etc driven by a computer code and to 
  limit the activities of the EU Patent Office, which seemed to be 
  moving toward allowing the patenting of software as such.
  
  You correctly note that the Liberal Democrat party has made it clear
  that we would "support continued widespread innovation in software
  by resisting the wider application of patents in this area." The
  LibDems are in favour of increased legal certainty in the EU. We 
  believe that a balance needs to be struck between the needs of small
  business on the one hand, to protect their inventions - and big 
  business, on the other, from patenting everything to the exclusion
  of competitors. This has guided our approach to the legislation 
  during its passage through the European Parliament.
  
  The European Parliament voted its first reading on the proposal in 
  September 2003 where amendments were adopted to strictly limit patents
  to new inventions only. The Parliament's position would harmonise 
  current practice in the European Patents Office, and ensure that 
  patents in the field of computer engineering would be issued on 
  the same basis in all EU Member States. Specifically, the UK Liberal
  Democrats supported an amendment to the definition, so that "In 
  order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention must be 
  susceptible of industrial application and new and involve an inventive
  step. In order to involve an inventive step, a computer-implemented
  invention must make a technical contribution". The principle was 
  accepted by the Council of Ministers when it adopted its common 
  position on 18 May, but the wording has been watered down by them.
  The Council also ignored some 80% of Parliaments amendments, mostly
  concerned to prevent the patenting of software as such.
  
  Personally, whilst I was not present to vote in September, I would 
  have supported the Parliaments overall position as all but a handful
  of British MEPs did. As such I will clearly take part in the Parliaments
  discussions over which amendments it may wish to re-table, or indeed 
  strengthen, at second reading. I think that the lack of a definition
  of what constitutes a technical contribution does seem to be a weakness
  in the current text and ought to be clarified by MEPs at second reading.
  As I have already said to a number of other experts (including from the
  academic world) who have been in contact with me it would thus be useful
  to be able to work constructively with you to find a wording that could
  protect innovation. If you have views on this, I would be delighted to 
  receive them if I am re-elected.
  
  I hope that this information is of use and that it might persuade you
  to vote Liberal Democrat in the forthcoming election.

Both letters from Elspeth Atwooll are based on a [[http://www.ffii.org.uk/players/people/meps/libdems/wallis.html|press release from Diana Wallis after the vote of September 23]] - as you can see, the [[http://www.edlug.ed.ac.uk/archive/Jun2004/msg00213.html|critique to the new letter is the same]], but it's good to see some apparently personal comments at the end of this letter.
