''The British delegate Andrew Duff of the British Liberals suggests new Amendments and asks his colleagues from the group ALDE for support.''

According to him the Liberals are working to get a majority of the colleagues of the Liberals and Democrats to make their voices heard against the Council's position, when the parliament votes next week.

Ironically Duff makes the formulation of supporting "radical" proposed amendments in the spirit of former prime minister Rocard his own. Michel Rocard has been ill-reputed as "radical" to individual industrial lobbyists, since his amendment requests aimed at solving the problem for the middle class. MEP Andrew Duff takes up some points from these amendments. Furthermore he mentions that today obviously a group meeting of the ALDE group took place. Today is also the "closing date" for amendments for the plenum.
