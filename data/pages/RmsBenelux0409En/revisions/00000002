 Eastern France: On demand. Parliament is '''not''' in Strasbourg that
 week, so maybe Metz or other big cities might be better?

 Frankfurt: If it works out, this could be a meeting with
 Deutsche Bank Research (not yet confirmed).

 Luxembourg: Alexandre (ad-hoc) suggested a meeting with Green Party. Because
 Luxembourg is small, he considers this will not spoil off the other
 parties.

 Brussels: Parliament would be in Brussels on Tuesday (@David, yes it is
 a 'pink' week). However, as a bigger event is scheduled for 9-10
 November by FFII in Brussels, a Parliament event would probably
 not be terribly big.
