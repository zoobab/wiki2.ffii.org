[[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/bolkestein/|Frits Bolkestein]]
who, during the Council meeting of 2004-05-18, tried to
allay fears of the present ministers by saying the following:

  The Commission has debated quite a long time about the possibility
  that a computer program as such could or should be patentable, and has
  decided against it. And in order to make this absolutely and perfectly
  clear, the Commission should like to introduce two amendments in
  Article 4a, which is entitled "exclusions from patentability". The
  Commission should like to propose a new Part 1 to this Article 4a, and
  the new Part 1 should quite simply read: "A computer program as such
  cannot constitute a patentable invention". I should take that as
  clear, and should allay any kind of apprehensions that, by some
  magical means, a computer program as such could after all become
  patentable; once again let me read it out for all clarity's sake: "A
  computer program as such cannot constitute a patentable invention".
