== Ralju is a Backup of petition.eurolinux.org (in fact the Backup is on fepni) ==

Dirk Hillbrecht makes a daily backup of petition.eurolinux.org:
 * He backs up the the petition signature database as well as the Zope database.

== More ==

 * petition.eurolinux.org is currently hosted at fepni.ffii.org.
 * fepni and ralju (pronounced like german ralssu) are both under patronance of jcwunder (Christoph Wunder).
 * bakfu is the virtual name for fepni and ralju.
 * It is intended that these to systems (ralju/fepni) are redundant.
 * Filesystem high availability is assured by mirroring two partitions, one on each system,  over a network block device.
 * heartbeat is also used

== What did we (mostly Chris) do to migrate jp stuff to fepni.ffii.org ? ==

 - Install python-1.5-2 (historic), current mysql 
 - stop mysqld on genba.ffii.org, stop zope on genba.ffii.org
        copy ''var/lib/mysql + /home/smets'' to ''mir/zope-jp'' on
        fepni.ffii.org
 - install /etc/init.d/petition on fepni
 - add user 'smets', group 'zopeadm', change everything zope-jp to 
        smets:zopeadm
 - recompile everything (*.pyc) (maybe not needed)
 - check that pcgi scripts such as zope.cgi are running with
   python-1.5 (and not python), grep for "/usr/bin/python" 
 - recompile pcgi (gcc) (maybe not needed)
 - ensure mysql is running (on fepni)
 - ensure zope-jp on fepni is running 
 - migrate vhosts from genba-apache1 to fepni/ralju 
 - do not forget to check that mod-cgi runs ;)
 - efforts took ca 8 hours
 - have fun !



== Problems of the machine ralju.ffii.org/fepni.ffii.org/bakfu.ffii.org ==

ralju seems to be a LojbanEn word, it's not prounced as anoy other known language,
for the pronounciation of the letters, see:

http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less1.html

 * r seems to be pronounced like in *R*ing (I assume, please correct if wrong)
 * a as in father (not as in h*a*t)
 * l like in *L*ord, or *L*ove or so, I assume...
 * j as in mea*s*ure or French bon*j*our ("ss")
 * u as in c*oo*l (not as in b*u*t)

I don't know what it means, maybe someone look it up and add it... ;-)

That's no problem :-) Take a look here: http://members.fortunecity.com/jeroenkuiper/Linguistics/Lojban/Dictionary/a.html

admiral  ralju (ral): x1 is principal/chief/leader/main/[staple], most significant among x2 (set) in property x3 (ka) [:staple :(= ralselpra); general/|/president/principal leader (= ralja'a, ralterbe'e; use additional terms to distinguish among these); also primary, prime, (adverb:) chiefly, principally, mainly; (x2 is complete specification of set)]

kopeck  fepni (fep fei): x1 is measured in |/cent money-subunits as x2 [quantity], in monetary system x3 [:also :pfennig, paisa, sen, fen, dinar, etc.; x1 is generally a price/cost/value]; (additional secondary, tertiary, etc. subunit places may be added as x4, x5, x6, ...)

pack  bakfu (baf): x1 is a bundle/package/cluster/clump/| [shape/form] containing x2, held together by x3 

Hopefully no problems here :-)
