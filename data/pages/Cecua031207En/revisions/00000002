The [[http://www.eifonline.org/site_16/fil/fil_23.pdf|Moscowitz paper]] is not located nor
linked to at http://cecua.org, but found only on the
[[http://www.eifonline.org/site/index.cfm?BID=16&SID=1&LG=2&HOMEP=1|main page]] of 
[[http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=European_Internet_Foundation|EIF]],
an organisation which organizes lobbying efforts of large companies.

The Moscowitz paper culminates in the demand that patent law should be left
to lawyers to determine.

was previously general secretary of the computer user association Inforep and already in that function
[[http://www.legalis.net/cgi-iddn/french/affiche-tv.cgi?droite=tvpratique/brevet_logiciels.htm&player=player.htm|spoke in favour of software patents at an EIF meeting on 2002-01-12]].  His statement was televised at the time.

We expect more "[[Ipat0304En| joint statement]]s" of "the industry" with "associations representing
millions of consumers in Europe", jointly asking for software patents and opposing
the European Parlament's vote, to be sent confidentially to
heads of governments in Europe, as has been done in recent months.
Alain Moscowitz seems to be playing the role of Graham Taylor.
