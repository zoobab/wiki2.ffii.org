=== 2004-12-22 Henrion Benjamin proposal ===

It would be nice to have legal advice on the reasons why A-items are not
listed and published on the provionnal agenda of the Council.

The publication at the last moment of the A-points is inadmissible. I
cannot find in the Rules of Procedure a difference of treatment between
A-items and B-items.

This practice make us prone to fear and stress to see this horrible item
on the agenda.

It seems that the Council Public Info is relunctant to point the special
differences of treatment that exists between those items in the CRP.

This behaviour is inacceptable from the most powerful body of the EU,
and should be challenged.

"It seems they are hiding behind a rule that does not exist and that would make the whole Rules of Procedure of the Council meaningless if it did."K.F. Lenz, 20.1.2005 (http://k.lenz.name/LB/archives/000966.html)
