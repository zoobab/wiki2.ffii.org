= Send a Postcard to your Representative Saying No to Software Patents =
 * ''No Software Patents -- Power to the Parliament''
 * ''Free Ideas for a Free World''
 * ''Data Processing is Not a Field of Technology''

Please join us in mobilizing to send postcards asking the EU Council Presidency to withdraw the [:Cons040518En: "political agreement"] on the "Directive on Computer-Implemented Inventions" and subject the text to true scrutiny and development by directly-accountable representatives.

== What's Happening: ==
Postcards sent from your vacations to "your" [http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/p_meps2.repartition?iorig=hom MEP] or [http://swpatwiki.ffii.org/NationalParliamentRepresentatives MP], are a neat and easy idea to keep contact to your representative and be put on the pinboard instead in the waste basket (as the ordinary lobbying mass postings).

Of course politicians enjoy vacation greetings from far countries just as much as we do. Of course, the postcards may not miss a hint to the current software patent issue. Thereby you can also point to !URLs, e.g.

 * Data Processing is not a Field of Technology (Parliament's Art 3a)

== The Plan: ==

 * call on our supporters before summer pause to
   * adopt a few politicians (primary national MPs, alternatively MEPs) from list of addresses we supply
     * http://swpatwiki.ffii.org/NationalParliamentRepresentatives
     * LtrConsRecv0406En
   * write their ccordinates (names, addresses etc) into your most personal address notebook that you carry around with you
   * also note URLs of argumentation papers relevant for them such as 
     * [http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/needs/ Software Patent Directive: What we want]
     * [http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/ Urgent Appeal]
   * write a postcard to each of them during your vacation
     * the political message can be extremely short: e.g. only 
**** "no software patents, power to the parliament" (slogan of 2004-04-14 demo)
**** "data processing is not a field of technology" ([http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/ EP 2003-09-24] Art 3a)
**** "free ideas for a free world" (slogan used in ffii demos and artwork)
     * apart from this, the postcard can contain the URL and some polite greeting text
     * use a postcard from your location of vacation 
**** Alternatively, via SwpatkunstEn you may find some material for printing postcards of your own
   * additionally, help us [:LtrConsRecv0406En: deliver] the [http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/ Urgent Appeal]
