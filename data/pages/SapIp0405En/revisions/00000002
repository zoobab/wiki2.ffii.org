= SAP boss worried about "IP problems with Opensource" =

http://blog.informationweek.com/windows/archives/000844.html

SAP CEO Henning Kagermann is cited:

"I'm not sure personally about the future of open source... There are some open questions for me. They start on the legal side. A few things could happen that could kill Linux."

If software companies using open source were forced to extract code from their products because of an IP violation, "then people like us will be extremely carefuly in using open source".

!InformationWeek thinks this is a reference to SCO;  but we think it is much more likely that Kagermann's thinking about software patents.

Kagermann has, unlike his predecessor Hasso Plattner, been supportive of SAP patent lawyer Hagedorn's efforts in putting SAP's voice behind the software patent lobby.  As !InformationWeek points out, SAP may have its own anti open source agenda, as Europe's largest commercial software company.
