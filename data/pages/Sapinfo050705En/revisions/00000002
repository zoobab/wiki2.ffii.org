''SAP-Info interviews Stefan Schindewolf, Infraserv Hoechst  chair of the Linux interest group of DSAG (German SAP user association)''


 Schindewolf: In my opinion, pure software patents are unacceptable. 
 You cant compare the development of applications with the development 
 of a high-value product like medication  so it does not justify patent 
 protection. Customers should not let themselves be affected by these 
 kinds of discussions. Taking your customers to court is certainly not
 the correct way to increase revenues and profits. Software manufacturers
 know that. 

 Companies that see patents as the only way to move customers
 to buy their own software rather than an open source products should
 rethink their business model. ...
