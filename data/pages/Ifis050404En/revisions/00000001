''With a delay of 7 months the results of a government-ordered survey on software patents and a interoperability study have been published.  Previously the Ministry of Economics had suppressed publication of the study after protests from Bitkom, the German branch of EICTA, and from the Ministry of Justice, which resented the interference in its turf.  A partial evaluation showed last month that the study revealed nearly unanimous animosity against software patents among German companies in the ICT sector, based on fairly detailed knowledge of the problems.  The full publication of the results from all 1200 participants confirmed this picture. A study about Interoperability/Patent protection and Competition recommends improvements with regard to Article 6a.''
