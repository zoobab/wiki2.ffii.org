== Questions I. Transparency and Interest Representation:  ==
This part will underpin a debate on lobbying activities in the EU

 *  Do you agree that efforts should be made to bring greater transparency to lobbying?

 * Do you agree that lobbyists who wish to be automatically alerted to consultations by the EU institutions should register and provide information, including on their objectives, financial situation and on the interests they represent? Do you agree that this information should be available to the general public? Who do you think should manage the register?

 * Do you agree to consolidating the existing codes of conduct with a set of common minimum requirements? Who do you think should write the code?

 * Do you agree that a new, inclusive external watchdog is needed to monitor compliance and that sanctions should be applied for any breach of the code?

== Questions II. The CommissionÂ’s minimum standards for consultation:  ==
This part will provide a structured framework for feedback on the application of the [http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/cnc/2002/com2002_0704en01.pdf standards]

 * In your view, has the Commission applied the general principles and minimum standards for consultation in a satisfactory manner? You may refer to the individual standards (provided, for ease of reference, in Annex 2).

 * Please give reasons for your reply and, where appropriate, provide examples.


== Questions III.Publication of Data on Beneficiaries of EU Funds ==
This part will launch a debate on the disclosure of data about the recipients of various EU funds managed by the Commission in partnership with Member States, notably the Structural Funds and Common Agricultural Policy.

 * Do you agree that it is desirable to introduce, at Community level, an obligation for Member States to make available information on beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management?

 * If so, what information should be required at national level? What would be the best means to make this information available (degree of information required, period covered and preferred medium)?
