''The Commission of the European Communities (CEC) says that there is an "economic majority" in favor of software patents.  This is what they concluded from a consultation in 2000, where more than 90% of the respondents were against, but those that were in favor were claimed to have greater weight "in terms of investments and jobs".  We try to show that even this claim was wrong.''
