 * Recitals 19 - 21a
 * Baseline: Council text [http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st11/st11979-re01.en04.pdf pdf]

== Recital 19 ==

=== Scope of directive ===

||  number  ||  submitter  ||  recommendation  ||  text  ||
||  ***  ||  Council  ||  ()  ||  This Directive should be limited to laying down certain principles as they apply to the patentability of such inventions, such principles being intended in particular to ensure that inventions which belong to a field of technology and make a technical contribution are susceptible of protection, and conversely to ensure that those inventions which do not make a technical contribution are not susceptible of protection.  ||
||  58 = 90 = 111 = 132 = 153 = 176 (S)  ||  Rocard '' Buzek 19  ||  +  ||  /deleted''  ||

The Council text claims there are non-technical inventions. The rest of this amendment does not really anything useful.

== Recital 20 ==

=== Effect on Community competitiveness ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Council | () | The competitive position of Community industry in relation to its major trading partners will be improved if the current differences in the legal protection of computer-implemented inventions are eliminated and the legal situation is transparent.  With the present trend for traditional manufacturing industry to shift their operations to low-cost economies outside the Community, the importance of intellectual property protection and in particular patent protection is self-evident. |
| 10 | JURI 10 | + | The competitive position of Community industry in relation to its major trading partners will be improved if the current differences in the legal protection of computer-implemented inventions are eliminated and the legal situation is transparent. |

The JURI amendment removes the unfounded conclusion that patents on software or CAI's help protect against outsourcing of manufacturing.

== Recital 20 a (new) ==

=== SMEs and monitoring ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 11 | JURI 11 | +/- | Small- and medium-sized enterprises are essential to the economic success and global competitiveness of the European Union and its Member States. Intellectual property rights benefit small and medium-sized enterprises just as they do larger entities. To ensure that this Directive advances the interests of SMEs, a Committee on Technological Innovation in the Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Sector should be formed. This Committee should focus on patent-related issues relevant to such enterprises and should bring these issues to the attention of the Commission as necessary. |

The blanket assertion that all !IPRs benefit !SMEs is dangerous in a legal document that will be interpreted by the European Court of Justice.  Some !IPRs help !SMEs; other !IPRs (especially software patents) can be damaging.  This sentence would therefore be better removed from the recital.


== Recitals 20 a' and 20 b (new) ==

=== Interoperability ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 69 | Mann/McCarthy | + | (recognised standard-setting organisation) |
| 70 | Mann/McCarthy | + | (fair reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing) |
 
 * See discussion under [:PlenInterop0507En: interoperability]


== Recital 21 ==

=== Competition law ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Council | () | This Directive should be without prejudice to the application of the competition rules, in particular Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, in particular where a dominant supplier refuses to allow the use of a patented technique which is needed for the sole purpose of ensuring conversion of the conventions used in two different computer systems or networks so as to allow communication and exchange of data content between them. |
| 12 | JURI 12 | + | This Directive should be without prejudice to the application of the competition rules, in particular Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. |

Articles 81 and 82 are relevant to all anticompetitive practices; but it should not be imagined that competition law in itself is sufficient to fix the particular problems for interoperability. 

== Recital 21 a (new) ==

=== Monitoring ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 13 | JURI 13 | - | Patents play an important role in European innovation. To ensure effective functioning of the patent system, it is important to monitor developments in this sector, including developments involving patents on computer-implemented inventions. To this end, relevant data should be gathered and appropriate reports produced. Such reports should include information pertaining specifically to participation by small- and medium-sized enterprises in the system of patents for computer-implemented inventions. |

Mostly harmless, but has no place in a EU legislative texts.
