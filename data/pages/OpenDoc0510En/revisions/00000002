''It has been suggested that FFII should develop some activity to promote adoption of'' !OpenDocument ''as a source file format which needs to be used by public administrations and other standard setters acting in public mission.  This page contains some basic info and should soon also contain some hints as to what FFII could do.''

== Position of "big" players ==

 * IBM in favour of !OpenDoc: [[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/65079|Bob Sutor: IBM-Vizepräsident will OpenDocument durchsetzen]] (in German)
 * Sun in favour of !OpenDoc: [[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/applications/0,39020384,39223863,00.htm|Tim Bray: OpenDocument could 'turn the world inside out']]

== Arguments ==

 * We alreay have standardised object formats such as PDF/A and HTML.  Source formats are difficult to standardise.  Even if OD is required everywhere, people may produce it with an application that has its own native format, and for editing the source it may then still be necessary to use that native format.
   * Counter-argument: the requirement must be that the system in question must support working with !OpenDocument as a source format for all kinds of documents where this is reasonably possible.
   * !OpenDocument is currently the only available open, free and productive format for office documents that allows full editing and collaboration for the whole suite of office applications (text, spreadsheet, data base and presentation).
   * Additionally !OpenDocument integrates natively with Internet infrastructure thanks to be 100% based on XML. 
   * No other office format is OASIS standard and no other is in (advanced) standardization process by ISO. 
   * Additionally it is the supported format by the IDABC, Valoris studio, from the European Commission.
   * Any application should be able to read, edit, save and print !OpenDocument no matter if it uses its own native format.

== Proposed Position and Activities of FFII ==

 * Inform FFII supporters about the issue and the status in the ISO certification.
 * Ask to FFII supporters to sign the [[http://opendocumentfellowship.org/petition/|petition to Microsoft to support OpenDocument in MS-Office]]
 * Lobby to national standarization bodies [[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/aboutiso/isomembers/MemberList.MemberSummary?MEMBERCODE=10|members of the ISO organization]].
 * Support parliamentary initiatives in various states
   * possibly in combination with parliamentary initiatives on the swpat issue
 * FfiiSkEn: FFII SK (Jan Husar) has worked a lot on this issue
 * We can always create an opendoc project with mailing lists for talking about !OpenDocument and other file format issues
 * Support the activities of the consortium [[http://opendocumentfellowship.org|OpenDocument Fellowship]]
