''2nd March 2005 -- The Council diplomats are deliberating whether the software patents directive should be added to the list of A-items to be adopted at Monday's "Competitiveness Council" session.  According to a document that has appeared on the Council website, the "consultation" on whether to insert this item must be concluded by Friday.''

Because the Council did not decide two weeks in advance according to the Rules of Procedure, any country can prevent inclusion of the A-item.  Moreover any country can ask for a recount of the vote (B-item), in which case the lack of a qualified majority would become apparent.  However there is strong pressure within the Council to adopt the text as an A-item.
