The letter was delivered by Antonios Christofides to the Minister's office, in the morning of 20/7/2004. The document delivered can be found at http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf (in Greek, of course). It was delivered together with a short cover letter. The people responsible for the incoming documents said the Minister, Mr. Sioufas, reads all of them and assigns them to others; they advised to call after a week in order to learn which person it will have been assigned to.

In the evening of that same day, a press release was issued by the Greek team. The Greek version of it is at http://epatents.hellug.gr/pages/pr_2004-07-20/.
