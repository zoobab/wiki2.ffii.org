The Washington Post has an 
[[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54548-2003Dec10.html|article]]
which reads:

  The country "needs to revamp not just the patent system, but the
  entire system of intellectual property law," said Andrew S. Grove,
  chairman of Intel Corp. "It needs to redefine it for an era that is
  the information age as compared to the industrial age."

This coincides with the 
[[Europarl0309En| European Parliament's decision of september]]
that

  Data processing is not a field of technology and innovations in the
  field of data processing are not inventions in the sense of patent law.

The telcoCEOs [[Telcos031107En| wrote]]: "We do not want to see any
sudden or dramatic reduction in the scope of what is patentable." and
here we have Intel Corp saying "please change now!".
