Munich is the first large city that is changing its data processing over to free software.  In doing so, Munich found that it has to impose patent indemnification clauses in its tenders, thereby effectively excluding small and medium enterprises from bidding.  The city administration has therefore spoken up against the EU Council's patent policy many times.
