= Strong Show of Opposition against Software Patents and Support for European Parliament =

Wednesday April 14, hundreds of yellow t-shirts with the slogan "No Software Patents" and "Power to the Parliament" illuminated the blue sky of Brussels.  Wearing the same colors, 7-800 demonstrators from 25 European countries[1] marched from the European Parliament to the Commission and Council and back.  In front of the Council building, pantomimes were performed and 500 balloons were released.[2]. 

The demonstration was followed by a conference in the European Parliament in an overcrowded auditorium (> 250 persons).  

The amendments voted in September by the elected legislators are today completely ignored by the [[SwpatconsiliumEn| Council's Patent Policy Working Party]] and by the [[SwpatcecEn| European Commission's Directorate for the Internal Market]], both of whom are evading all discussion and hiding behind the [[SwpatepoEn| European Patent Office]]. The speeches of [[DavidEllardEn| David Ellard]], in charge of the dossier at the European Commission, and of [[DavidSantEn| David Sant]] from the European Patent Office particularly illustrated this unwillingness to take any concerns into account.

Note the continuation of this second round with conferences in [[http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/ljub04/|Slovenia]] and Poland these next weeks, then opinion-building work at the time of the elections of the European Parliament in June, and during the next reading of this directive in Parliament, expected for this autumn.
