The European Greens have [[http://www.greens-efa.org/en/press/detail.php?id=2213&lg=en|questioned the council procedure]].
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Co-President of the Greens/EFA Group questioned the way in which the directive has been added 'in extremis' to the order of the day: 
"The Dutch presidency has incredibly kept changing the agenda right up until the last minute, in a way that is bordering on illegal. The presidency is prepared to do anything to get this directive through and avoid a new vote, which, in my opinion, would no longer reach a qualified majority if the Council were to vote again today."

Commentary Holger Blasum: Now that here in Germany our agricultural minister is a Green, this is a very good opportunity for the now 13 Brussels Eurogreens to make the best of their links to Berlin (the dataflow between those two busy hubs had not always been in sync in the past). Given the Council's bending of rules, raison d'etat here is not to go with that mess even from formal aspects alone, not to say anything on the inconsistencies in subject matter that the Agriculture Ministers shall plow under here. Note that even the wording of the (ever-changing) agenda just '''asks''' but not '''binds''' the ministers.  Also make sure you are there right from the beginning, being absent is not an excuse, this time the A item is as important as the "proper business" of the council.
