2004-05-16 Luxemburg Gov't plans to abstain in Council Vote

It has been said that Luxemburg's minister of economy, Mr Henri GRETHEN, will ask for Parliament's Art 6a and
maybe some parts of the amendment to article 2 (definitions of "technical", possibly circular, 
without "forces of nature", as he's agreeing only to "some part").

It looks like he did not understand that we need more than "interoperability" (this could also mean [RAND],
it's better to say "freedom of interoperation" - be free to interoperate, or "Free interoperation").
