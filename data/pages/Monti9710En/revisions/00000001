A few months after his directorate hat published the "Green Paper on Patents" and thereby officially launched preparations for the project of a EU directive on software patents, the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mario Monti, said in a speech in Munich what the purpose of this directive project was understood to be: "to protect computer software by patents, to the benefit of our software developers."

  Speech by Commissioner Mario Monti
  Munich, 7 October 1997

  Twenty years of the European Patent Office 

  I would like to congratulate the European Patent Office for the
  important work it has done in the past 20 years for the promotion of
  patents in Europe.

  The Commission attaches great importance to industrial property in
  general, and to patents in particular. Patents are essential for the
  promotion of innovation, and innovation in turn is vital for the
  viability and success of modern economy.

  It is very much our belief in the Commission that the patent system
  should not be looked at in isolation. It constitutes a part of an
  industrial policy which must be co-ordinated today at European
  level. With this spirit, the Commission has produced the Green Paper
  on Patents. This document was approved by the Commission in June. Its
  objective is to find ways to modernise and improve the patent system
  in Europe.

  At this stage, I am pleased to report that the Green Paper has already
  generated much interest in various circles: in the industry, among the
  private practitioners and also, among patent offices. Our intention is
  to listen carefully to the users of the patent system in Europe, to
  examine whether new Community initiatives are necessary and to
  consider what these new measures could be.  On several points, it
  seems that a broad consensus is already there; I refer in particular
  to the opportunity to protect computer software by patents, to the
  benefit of our software developers.

  A major new initiative stemming from the Green Paper could involve the
  establishment of the Community Patent in the form of a Community
  instrument. The objective of the Green Paper on this point is
  clear. The Commission awaits a clear position from industry, to see
  whether such an instrument would be necessary in the present
  context. Depending on the degree of interest and motivation for such
  an instrument, the Commission will decide on the best way to proceed
  further.

  One has to see whether, on top of a flexible system such as the
  European Patent, there is a need for a unitary title of protection in
  today's Community.

  The European Patent Office will have a major role to play in this
  process, since it will be the operator of any such system. But the
  role of the national patent offices is also extremely important for
  the patent system in Europe. They constitute a most valuable contact
  point for local businesses and can provide technical information
  tailored to the local needs. National patent offices have a role to
  play as an "entry point" into the European patent system.

  I know that the Green Paper tackles some difficult issues, such as the
  translation requirements. It is my belief that it is unacceptable that
  the cost of patents in Europe are overburdened by the translation
  costs, while these translations are hardly used. The Commission
  considers that work should continue on the various proposals which
  have been tabled in this organisation, with a view to finding the most
  appropriate and balanced solution. In this respect, I have recently
  taken the initiative to write to the ministers of industry of the
  Member States to draw their attention to the problem of translation
  costs of patents and on the need to find a balanced solution to this
  question.

  Although the European Patent Office is an independent organisation
  from the Community institutions, there is certainly interaction, and
  even synergy, between the two organisations.

  The observer status the Commission has in the Administrative Council
  allows it to have a direct entry into the organisation. It allows us
  to make the necessary links between the work of this Organisation and
  the industrial policy for which the Commission has responsibility.

  On the legislative side, several initiatives taken by the Commission
  have had or are going to have some implications for the work of this
  office.  The creation of supplementary protection certificates in the
  Community has led to the first revision of the European Patent
  Convention since its entry into force in 1977.

  The very important proposal for a directive on biotechnological
  inventions, once adopted, will have to be taken into account by the
  EPO to ensure coherence and identity of treatment of this kind of
  inventions throughout Europe.

  It is also obvious that the TRIPs Agreement, concluded in the context
  of the GATT multilateral negotiations, has had an impact on the patent
  law of all European countries and should also be fully implemented by
  this organisation.

  I would like to use the opportunity of this ceremony to give my wishes
  to the countries of this Organisation which are not Member States of
  the European Union and to the countries which have signed an extension
  agreement with the organisation.

  I know that several countries have applied to join the
  Organisation. In the Union, negotiations in view of the accession of
  new members will start in the near future, in fact in 1998. The
  Commission considers that accession to the European Patent Convention
  could be seen as preparatory work in a specific and technical area,
  which should be used as a useful experience for other areas where
  approximation will be required.

  As you can see, the agenda of the Commission in the area of patents is
  full. On our side, we are determined to go ahead and to make
  progress. I don't doubt that this Organisation is looking for the same
  results.
