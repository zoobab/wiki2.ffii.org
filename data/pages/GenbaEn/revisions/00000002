== the name genba ==

"genba" is a japanese word meaning "the place where things are happening".
It is used in the west by Kaizen consultants in the meaning of "shop floor" of a factory,
e.g. they would call a medium-level manager out from behind his office desk and drag him
out to the "genba", so that he may get directly involved with the processes in the factory.

== Backups ==

For information concerning the backup strategy have a look at the file "/etc/rsyncd.conf".  As of this writing (2005-04-17) only Jeroen has access to the backups.

 * ffii.org.uk is currently owned by Alex Macfie
 * ffii.cz is currently owned by Stepan Kasal (currently just refers to ffii.org)

== bittorrent ==

phm tried to install (debian package is there), but failed to put it to use.
domain http://pattorrent.ffii.org is there, see ''var/www/pattorrent''.
This system could be useful for distributing patent files (10M pdfs from EPO)
over the Internet.

Another possibility is to use [[http://freecache.org|FreeCache]]. In short, you can have any file between 5MB and 1GB cached by them for free by prepending !http://freecache.org in front of the url (e.g. !http://freecache.org//!http://swpat.ffii.org/bigswpatfile.zip)
