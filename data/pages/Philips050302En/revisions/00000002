''The Hague, 2 March 2005 -- A day before the Dutch Parliament will debate several motions asking its government to reopen discussions in the Council, several documents were sent to involved Dutch members of parliament, trying to convince them that the Council version is "balanced", does not allow "pure software patents", "protects interoperability" and "prevents trivial patents". They also claim that Europe needs software patents in order to compete with the USA and that international treaties require software patents.''

== English translation ==

The original (Dutch) document, which can be found at the bottom of this page, starts out by giving a supposedly impartial overview of the situation, and finishes with Philips' position. This is a partial translation of that last part.

=== General ===
  
  Philips supports the patentability of all technical inventions and is
  no proponent of excluding inventions with software. According to
  Philips, inventors in all sectors need patents to protect their
  inventions to provide for incentives and financial means and to
  promote a transfer of technology. Inventions with software are no
  exception to this rule.
  
  The latest draft directive of the EU Council of Ministers (May 2004)
  takes into account all interests. Trivial patent applications and
  applications for patents on pure software, feared by opponents of
  software patents, are not accepted by this directive. Philips squarely
  supports attempts to quickly eliminate trivial patents. As in all
  other economic sectors, patents on inventions which contain software
  will only be granted if the invention provides a technical solution
  which is new, non-obvious and industrially applicable.
  
=== Open Source ===
  
  The draft directive also respects the 'open source' movement and
  guarantees that different technical systems can work together. This
  'interoperability' is equally essential for an open, innovative
  company such as Philips, as for small companies and consumers.
  
  Patents do not obstruct the free flow of information; on the contrary,
  they promote this flow. Just like patents for other inventions, the
  owner of a patents on an invention which contains software must
  provide essential information about this invention.
  [..]

##  This transparency
##  promotes innovation, because it enables other researchers and
##  inventors to build upon the new knowledge. The alternative for patents
##  is secrecy and negative protectionism by inventors. That is what would
##  really stifle innovation.
  
  In almost all electronic products, innovative technologies are applied
  for information and data transfer. Inventions with software play a key
  role in the advancement of these technologies. Massive exclusion of
  patentability of inventions in this field would go against the TRIPS
  treaty from 1995 of the World Trade Organisation.
  [..]

##  This essential
##  international treaty on Intellectual Property /(capitalised in
##  original text as well)/ clearly states that inventions in '''all''' fields
##  of technology must be patentable. There is no exclusion for inventions
##  with software.
  
=== Research and development ===
  
  The draft directive of the Council follows the current practice of the
  EPO and will increase the harmonisation and legal certainty in the
  field throughout Europe.
  
  If the patentability of inventions with software is removed, this has
  serious consequences for the competitiveness of Europe and as such
  also for future employment. It would damage the ability of enterprises
  to finance research and development.
  [..]

##  After all, tech-enterprises
##  increasingly use their patents to achieve a reasonable return on
##  investment in this field. This return motivates and enables them to
##  continue their enormous research efforts.

  Europe would become a much less attractive location for research if
  every software-supported invention can be imitated without financial
  compensation for the inventor, while the patenting of such inventions
  is and remains normal in the US and Japan.
  [..]

##  The 'Lisbon goal' to make
##  Europe the most innovative and powerful knowledge economy in the world
##  by 2010 becomes impossible. Terminating patents on inventions with
##  software would encourage innovative companies to reduce their expenses
##  in so far research and development in Europe is concerned, and move
##  activities to other continents.
  
  Many license agreements of European companies will be undermined by
  the the elimination of patents on inventions with software.
  [..]

##  Innovative
##  companies such as Philips would suddenly be confronted with a
##  significant decrease concerning the return on their investments in
##  research and development, because a large part of their patent
##  portfolio in Europe would no langer have any financial value.
  
  Because of all these reasons, Europe must maintain patents on
  inventions with software. If we want to reduce the number of trivial
  patents which inhibit research, there is a much better solution:
  strengthen the gate keepers. If our national and international patent
  offices would have more staff, more financial means and better
  instruments, they would be able to perform their work even better than
  they do now while separating the chaff from the wheat among the patent
  applications. Let us not try to solve the problem of trivial patents
  by simply banning patents on inventions with software. That 'solution'
  would after all create a much larger problem: serious damage to
  Europe's knowledge economy and employment.

=== Software patents or computer-implemented inventions? ===

Philips keeps claiming the Council text does not allow software patents, but only patents on "inventions with software". This is pertinently false, as has been shown many times already:

 The exclusion ground of art. 52 par 2.c regarding computer
 programs (as such, art. 52 par 3) has been largely reasoned
 away in the decision practice of the EPO. Computer programs
 do have to, just like other inventions, comply with the general
 conditions of adequate technical character. This last part
 mainly boils down to the art of formulating the innovation
 as explicitly as possible as a 'technical' problem, or to
 formulate the obtained effect as explicitly as possible to
 be 'technical', and to direct the claims (also) to that.
''Prof. mr D.W.F. Verkade, mr DJ.G. Visser, mr L.D. Bruining, Broader patentability of computer programs: technicality or revolution?,'' [[http://www.vrijschrift.nl/nl/softwarepatenten/publ_overheid/ovc.pdf|report for Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs]]/, 1999, point 2.1.4  (Dutch)/

 
 Most importantly perhaps, the technical contribution criterion does
 not prevent all business methods to be patented
''R. Bakels, P. B. Hugenholtz, "The patentability of computer programs",'' [[http://www.ivir.nl/publications/other/softwarepatent.pdf|report for the JURI Committee of the European Parliament]]/, 2002./

 
 However, the EPO already allows business methods that are
 patentable in the U.S. to be basically patented in Europe, because
 they are seen as processes fulfilling all the criteria for patentability.

 by adopting the existing proposal the main problems that America
 has been facing regarding software patents will not be avoided.
 (about the Council proposall)

 However this directive does not create any more legal certainty then
 there is today. (idem)
''S. Paulsson, "Patenting Software vs. Free software",'' [[http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/epecosci0502/SoftwarePatent.pdf|report for the Directorate General for Economic and Social Policy of the European Parliament]]/, 2004/ 

As Philips correctly confirms, "The draft directive of the Council follows the current practice of the EPO". This current practice of the EPO is however barely different from the US practice in so far software and business method patents are concerned.

The European Parliament allowed for patents on technical inventions steered by computers. The Council version allows patents on pretty much all "processes performed by computer"; this consequently includes both real inventions and pure software and business methods.

=== Outsourcing ===

Philips warning for the potential loss of jobs in Europe unless we get software patents, is somewhat strange:

 In order to remain competitive, companies are shifting jobs from the
 West to Asia. Initially it was in manufacturing, but increasingly it
 has come to include support functions in services and research and
 development.
''Gerard Kleisterlee, President of Philips,'' [[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/02/content_396591.htm|interview in China Daily newspaper]]/, December 2004/

This was an article without any reference whatsoever to software patents. Large companies will always look for the lowest wages (combined with adequate quality), and e.g. the fact that according to that same company China is a country full of "copycats" and patents offer little protection there, does not seem to bother them.

=== Competitiveness ===

 Similarly, the wish of the European Commission to enable the
 patentability of computer programs as such, without any
 demonstrated or demonstrable usefulness to society, demonstrates
 a lot of audacity. (regarding the introduction of "program product
 claims", similarly to article 5.2 of the Council proposal)
''Prof. mr D.W.F. Verkade, mr DJ.G. Visser, mr L.D. Bruining, Broader patentability of computer programs: technicality or revolution?,'' [[http://www.vrijschrift.nl/nl/softwarepatenten/publ_overheid/ovc.pdf|report for Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs]]/, 1999, point 5.2 (Dutch)/

 
 Patents are - compared to certain other sectors - relatively unimportant
 for the software sector, although there is a clear trend towards more
 patenting. Due to the high administrative costs of obtaining and
 maintaining them, due to the mentioned unequal distribution
 of market power and due to the specific product features of software,
 it seems that patents are more profitable for large than for small
 companies.
''Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs,'' [[http://www.vrijschrift.nl/nl/softwarepatenten/publ_overheid/juri_econom_swpat.pdf|The juridical and economical aspects of the software patent]]/, 2001 (Dutch)/

 
 the decision whether to invest in a software company is subject to a
 wide variety of criteria, and unlike in such a field as life sciences,
 the most successful investments in software companies cannot be
 attributed to the ownership of patents;
''Benchmark Capital, Bernhard Schmid (partner, Deutsche VC) et al.,'' [[http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/patent_declaration.html|Declaration By Venture Investors and Venture-Funded Companies on Software Patents]]/, 2004/ 


=== Interoperability ===

Interoperability is not guaranteed by the Council proposal. It only states that exceptions in copyright law for interoperability remain in force. This doesn't change anything in this case, given that these privileges cannot be forbidden using patents in the first place.

The Council proposal thus only guarantees that a patent holder cannot forbid to find out how to exchange information with a program that uses his patented technique. The patent holder can however without any problem forbid you from actually performing said data exchange once you have figured out how to do it, since there is no exception for this action in the Council proposal!

=== TRIPS treaty ===

 According to voices domestically and abroad, the TRIPS treaty
 would, given the mention of 'all fields of technology', and given
 the absence of an exclusion for computer programs, mandate
 patentability for this category, and would - in other words -
 its exclusion run counter to the TRIPS treaty.
 ..
 Besides, it is quite implausible that the negotiators in the Uruguay
 round of the TRIPS treaty wanted to go that far that they wanted
 to put aside the choices made by the Subscribing States to the EPC.
 The exclusion can also be justified under the TRIPS treaty, now that
 art. 27 TRIPS itself leaves room for interpretation regarding the
 explanation of 'technology'.
''Prof. mr D.W.F. Verkade, mr DJ.G. Visser, mr L.D. Bruining, "Broader patentability of computer programs: technicality or revolution?,'' [[http://www.vrijschrift.nl/nl/softwarepatenten/publ_overheid/ovc.pdf|report for Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs]]/, 1999, point 2.1.6 (Dutch)/


=== Trivial patents ===

This problem exists and is real, for all patents. It is however also completely besides the point. This directive is not about triviality, and cannot change anything about that. The problems of software patents are not limited to trivial patents, it goes way beyond that.
