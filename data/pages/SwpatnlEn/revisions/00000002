''In the Netherlands, both the Parliament and the scientists who studied the software patents question at the order of the government since 2000 have been clearly opposed to software patentability.  However the Ministry in charge has continuously ignored these studies, misinformed the Parliament and acted contrary to its instructions on this dossier.  Even cross-party motions involving the governing parties did not help against the combined power of the "Royal" company Philips and the ministerial patent bureaucracy.''
