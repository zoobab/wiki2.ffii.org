''During his tenure as finance minister of Ireland, Charlie'' !McCreevy ''further strengthened the tax exemptions which have turned Ireland into a tax haven for patent revenues in the European Union.  In particular, transfer of IP rights was made tax-free.  While the tax exemption policies were labelled as measures designed to foster R&D investment in Ireland, it is clear from the figures that Ireland is mainly being used as a hub for international transfers.  We have here collected some facts which need to be analysed further.''

  5. Finance Bill 2004 - Stamp Duty Exemption for
     Intellectual Property Transfers 

  On 4 February 2004, Minister McCreevy published the
  Finance Bill, 2004. As was anticipated in the Budget, the
  Finance Bill currently includes an exemption from stamp
  duty on transfers of intellectual property, and it
  provides that the exemption will apply where a transfer of
  intellectual property involves one of the following:

  (a) any invention, patent, supplementary protection
      certificate, trade mark, domain name, registered
      design, copyright (and related rights) or design
      right,
  (b) any plant breeders' rights under the Plant Varieties
      (Proprietary Rights) Act 1980,  
  (c) any application for the grant or registration of
      anything within paragraph (a) or (b),
  (d) any licence or other right in respect of anything
      within paragraph (a), (b) or (c),
  (e) any rights under the law of a country, territory,
      Stateor area outside the State, that correspond or
      are similar to those within paragraph (a), (b), (c)
      or (d),and
  (f) goodwill, to the extent that it is inherent in
      anything within paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e).

  LES had made submissions to the Minister in respect of
  the desirability of removing the charge to stamp duty to
  IP transfer, and welcomes the imminent amendments to the
  law.  LES has also made submissions to the department as
  to the nature and scope of the exemption framed in the
  Bill.

== McCreevy signs of IP pricing policies ==

Here he signs off on a couple of pricing policies for exclusive rights.  Could be significant policy, but I didn't read it.

This is another rule, by McCreevy himself, eliminating some sorta tax on interest and royalties.

  McCreevy Abolishes Stamp Duty On Intellectual Property Transfers
  by Robin Pilgrim, LawAndTax-News.com, London 05 December 2003

  Irish Finance Minister, Charlie McCreevy's decision to remove
  stamp duty on transfers of intellectual property (IP) has been
  welcomed, although there is some confusion as to the likely
  extent of the measure.

  Currently, purchasers of intellectual property such as patents,
  copyrights, and trademarks are obliged to pay stamp duty at a
  rate of 9% on the gross value of the IP in question.

  However, concern has been expressed about the fact that Mr
  McCreevy made no mention of goodwill (the most common type of IP
  on which stamp duty is currently paid) in his budget speech on
  Wednesday, suggesting that it may not be included in the
  exemption.

  The estimated costs of the measure, predicted to be around
  300,000 euros over one year, provide support for suggestions
  that goodwill may not be included.

  Speaking with regard to the stamp duty exemption following the
  unveiling of his financial statement, the Finance Minister
  explained that:

  "There will be consultations with relevant bodies about the
  scope of the provision before publication of the Finance Bill."

== R&D Tax Credit comes into effect ==

Is the R&D tax credit spoken of at the following link significant?

  R&D Tax Credit comes into effect

  The Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy TD, has signed a
  Commencement Order bringing into effectthe new research and
  development (R&D) tax credit. In the Finance Act, 2004 the
  Minister provided for a 20%tax credit for additional expenditure
  on R&D that can be set against a company's corporation tax
  liability. TheOrder made by the Minister for Finance appoints 1
  January 2004 as the effective date for the operation ofthe
  provision.Meanwhile, the Minister for Enterprise,
  Trade and Employment Mary Harney, has announced themaking of
  Regulations for the purposes of providing detailed guidance on
  what activities constitute R&Dactivities for the purposes of the
  tax credit. These Regulations will have effect from 1 January
  2004.

=== Figures from Irish Patent Office ===

Above that is the following interesting passage:

  i n t e l l e c t u a l   p r o p e r t y   t r e n d s   i n   2 0 0 3

  The Annual Report of the Controller of Patents,Designs and Trade
  Marks was published on 23rdApril 2004. The Report reveals some
  interesting trends in relation to filings for the various forms of
  intellectual property. Patents and trade marks are the most
  commonly known of the registrable forms of intellectual property.
  However there is also protection for designs and in certain
  circumstances the Controller has jurisdiction in respect of
  copyright matters.  It is clear that overall the bulk of
  applications for all forms of registered intellectual property
  protection originate from Ireland, the UK andthe US. Following
  Ireland's ratification of the European Patent Convention in 1992,
  which allows for the centralised filing of patent application in
  Europe, it is generally acknowledged that the number of national
  patent applications here has fallen. The Report confirms that the
  number of patent applications has now stabilised at around 25% of
  the pre 1992 level. However the number of patent applications
  filed in Ireland during 2003 was 939, which is less than in the
  previous year and is the lowest figure since 1996. Additionally
  the Irish Patent Office is a receiving office for international
  patent applications under the Patent Co-Operation Treaty. Almost
  50% of such applications were made by non-Irish applicants.  The
  Office also administers European patent applications. There has
  been a 61% increase in such filings since 2002.  During 2003, the
  Controller received 141 applications for registration of designs,
  in relation to a total of 274 designs. It appears that the number
  of Irish applicants is less than last year however. Design
  legislation dates back to 1927, yet it is arguably the least well
  known ofregistrable intellectual property rights. Since March
  2002, there is also a system which allows for the protection of
  both registered and unregistered designs on a European Community
  basis. The unregistered right lasts for three years whereas the
  registered rights lasts for five years but is renewable. Although
  applications for registered Community Designs have been
  permissible since January 2003, only 11 applications have been
  filed through the Irish office.

  A total of 2,427 applications for trade marks werereceived
  during 2003 compared to 2,604 in 2002and 3,760 in 2001. Like
  patents, this can be explained by an increasing international
  focus.Thus the number of international applications designating
  Ireland received in 2003 was 3,739 compared to 105 in 2001. The
  Controller estimates that international applications account for
  approximately 60% of all new applications received during 2003.
  It is also worth noting the importance of monitoring trade mark
  portfolios because 3,830 trade marks were removed from the
  register in 2003 due to non payment of renewal fees.  The
  Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 gives the Controller
  authority to determine disputes inrelation to the use of sound
  recordings in publicand he oversees the Register of Copyright
  Licensing Bodies, the Register of Licensing Bodies for
  Performers' Property Rights and the Register of Licensing Bodies
  for Database Rights. There are a number of legislative
  developments in train at present. One useful development is the
  proposal to establish a link between the procedure for obtaining
  an international trademark registration and a Community Trade
  Mark registration. In other words a Community TradeMark could be
  used as a basis for an international registration and vice versa.
  The benefit for the applicant will be reduced cost and increased
  efficiency. Such a development is likely to continue the move
  away from national applications.  Businesses should be aware of the
  full range of intellectual property protection available and be
  conscious of the fact that a significant proportion of
  applications here are international in nature (designating
  Ireland) and are being made by non-Irish entities. Being aware
  of and reacting to international trends in intellectual property
  protection is a good basis on which businessescan build
  competitive advantage.The Annual Report can be viewed at

  McCreevy Brings New R&D Tax Credit Into Force
  by Jason Gorringe, Tax-News.com, London 14 July 2004

  Irish Minister for Finance Charlie McCreevy has signed a
  Commencement Order bringing into effect the countrys new
  research and development tax credit. 

  The new measure, which has an effective date of January 1, 2004,
  is contained in the Finance Act and makes provision for a 20%
  tax credit for additional expenditure on R&D that can be set
  against a company's corporation tax liability. 

  Noted Mr McCreevy of the new rules: "R&D is the key to a more
  knowledge-intensive economy aimed at providing a sustainable
  long-term basis for growth in employment and incomes."

  He continued: "The tax credit for R&D will help to enhance our
  competitiveness as a location for new internationally mobile
  research-related investment, and will encourage existing
  overseas and indigenous firms to add research functions to
  their operations in Ireland or to increase their level of
  research activity." 

  Meanwhile, the T??¡iste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and
  Employment Mary Harney, has announced the drafting of
  Regulations designed to give companies guidance on what
  activities constitute research and development for the purposes
  of the tax credit. 

  "The overall aim of the R&D tax credit is to encourage an
  increase in the amount of research and development carried out
  by companies and to make Ireland an attractive destination for
  foreign companies to commence or increase research and
  development," Ms Harney commented.

  She added: "Specifically, we are seeking to encourage
  activities which will contribute to an enhancement of the
  calibre of research and development in Ireland and create high
  quality jobs and opportunities for our workforce." 

  These Regulations will also have an effective date of January
  1, 2004.
