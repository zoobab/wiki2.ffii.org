''26 July 2005 -- In a recent court ruling at the highest court of the UK, a software patent was rejected on the basis of Article 52 EPC with reasoning that criticises current doctrines of the European Patent Office and rejected directive proposal from the Commission and Council and demands a "harder" exclusion of software.''

In the [[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1623.html|Halliburton vs Smith]] case, a software patent was rejected for reasons we have yet to analyse separately.

On the same day the [[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html|judgment in "CPFH's Application"]] was published, which is also well worth a read.

Both were recently noted in the [[http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/|IPKat blog]].

== CPFH's Application: How pure software is to be effectively excluded ==

|| "What is an 'invention'? That is what this case is about" ||

-- so begins Mr Prescott QC in line one of his judgement on "CPFH's Application", before [[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html|going out of his way to give a complete tour of Art 52 EPC]]: given in the High Court, coincidentally on the same day as the "Halliburton vs Smith" case. 

There are a lot of points he makes well.  And not least, his strong approval that there are some very good reasons for not allowing patents on pure software:

   35. The same approach cannot be taken to computer programs. The
       reason why computer programs, as such, are not allowed to be
       patented is quite different. Although it is hotly disputed now
       by some special interest groups, the truth is, or ought to be,
       well known. It is because at the time the EPC was under
       consideration it was felt in the computer industry that such
       patents were not really needed^[14]

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note14

       were too cumbersome (it was felt that searching the prior art
       would be a big problem

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note15,

       and would do more harm than good

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note

       .
       I shall not go into details here but it is worth noting that the
       software industry in America developed at an astonishing pace
       when no patent protection was available

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note17

       Copyright law protects computer programs against copying. A
       patent on a computer program would stop others from using it
       even though there had been no copying at all. So there would
       have to be infringement searches. Furthermore you cannot have a
       sensible patent system unless there exists a proper body of
       prior art that can be searched. Not only are most computer
       programs supplied in binary form -- unintelligible to humans --
       but most of the time it is actually illegal to convert them into
       human-readable form

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note18

       A patent system where it is illegal to search most of the prior
       art is something of an absurdity.
 
   36. For those and other reasons it is not surprising that in, this
       instance, the exclusion is "harder". You are not allowed to get
       round the objection -- that you are attempting to patent a
       computer program -- by claiming it as a physical artefact, a mere
       change of form. You cannot patent "A computer ''disk'' when
       storing my computer program" or "A ''computer'' when programmed to
       function according to my program". For if that were allowed you
       would get a monopoly to the use of your computer program,
       defeating the policy of the law. (There may be superficial
       exceptions but they turn on the fact that your invention is not
       a mere computer program.)
 
   37. Recently, the scope of this exclusion has been under
       re-consideration by the European Union

http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#note19

       The Commission wanted to harmonise the law by defining the line
       between inventions that are properly patentable and mere
       computer programs. Although not strictly relevant to what I have
       to decide, I must admit I watched developments with some
       anxiety. Had the proposal succeeded it would have entrenched a
       test involving 'technical contribution' and 'technical features'
       that I suspect is too vague to be workable at the margin. On 6
       July 2005 the proposed directive was defeated in the European
       Parliament and it will not be re-introduced.
 
   [...]

   91. The legislation requires that, in order for something to be
       patentable, it must ''be'' an invention, it must be susceptible of
       industrial application, it must be new, and it must involve an
       inventive step (i.e. it must not be obvious). Those are four
       conditions. They are mandatory. None of them can be reasoned out
       of existence under the guise of interpretation.
 
   92. By "//be// an invention" I mean not be excluded by Article
       52(2). If something is an invention in that sense we can call it
       "technology" for short. I shall revert to that presently.
 
   93. It must also be the law that, for something to count as new and
       non-obvious, it must do so ''under the description'' 'invention',
       in that sense. It is not enough that something is new and not
       obvious if the sole novelty or inventive step consists of
       something that is excluded from basic patentability by Article
       52 (but it must really be excluded by Article 52: see further
       below). Tomorrow's newspaper will be a manufactured article; it
       will certainly be a new article; and at least some of its
       contents will not be obvious. But the newspaper will not be
       patentable on mere account of the novel and non-obvious
       information it presents. For the news itself will not satisfy
       those conditions under the description 'invention', but only
       under the description 'excluded matter'. There must be unity
       under the four conditions. Likewise, if it should turn out that
       tomorrow's newspaper is printed with a new but obvious ink, it
       will satisfy three out of the four conditions, but that will not
       be enough.
 
   94. To that extent I believe the EPO is right no longer to apply the
       "technical contribution" test. Properly regarded, that was a
       two-stage test that identified what was new (not disclosed in
       the past) and then asked whether it was 'technical' (i.e. not
       excluded from patentability). But it cannot be right to stop
       there. The new advance also must not have been obvious to those
       skilled in the art and that too must be under the description
       'technical' (i.e. not excluded from patentability). In practice
       it may not be useful to consider whether something is an
       'invention' without considering whether it is new and
       non-obvious. Much the same thing was said by the House of Lords
       in ''Biogen Inc v. Medeva plc'' [1997] RPC 1, 42.
 
   95. A patentable invention is new and non-obvious information about
       a thing or process that can be made or used in industry. What is
       new and not obvious can be ascertained by comparing what the
       inventor claims his invention to be with what was part of the
       state of the existing art. So the first step in the exercise
       should be to identify what it is the advance in the art that is
       said to be new and non-obvious (and susceptible of industrial
       application). The second step is to determine whether it is both
       new and not obvious (and susceptible of industrial application)
       under the description 'an invention' (in the sense of Article
       52). Of course if it is not new the application will fail and
       there is no need to decide whether it was obvious.
 
   96. In order to identify what is the advance in the art that is said
       to be new and non-obvious the Patent Office may rely on prior
       art searches. But in my judgment it is not invariably bound to
       do so. It will often be possible to take judicial notice of what
       was already known. Patent Office examiners are appointed because
       they have a professional scientific or technical training. They
       are entitled to make use of their specialist knowledge. Of
       course the letter of objection will state the examiner's
       understanding of the technical facts in that regard, and thus
       the applicant will have the opportunity to refute it in case
       there has been a mistake.
 
   97. Reverting to "under the description 'an invention'", it will
       often be possible to take a short cut by asking "Is this a new
       and non-obvious advance in technology?" That is because there
       can often be universal agreement about what is 'technology', see
       paragraph 11 above. But sometimes it will not be possible
       without running the risk of error, see paragraph 12. If there is
       any doubt it will then be necessary to have recourse to the
       terms of Article 52 of the Convention.

== Comment by James Heald ==
 
This could be sharper: I'd like to have seen it more closely related
to the EPC. I like the stress that this should be a tightening of
procedure, not a relaxation. But of course it doesn't work if it
allows the definition of what is technical to slip, and therefore what
sort of contribution can be considered technical. "Technical" '''must'''
be held to mean something beyond the functioning of a programmed
computer, and characteristics which only relate to that functioning.

Interesting, if it can be read as a UK attempt to "embrace and extend" 
the EPO doctrine - ie constructively engage with the formalism, but 
simultaneously give it a much less permissive application, and hope that 
the shift will percolate back to Munich.

  103. It was the policy of the "computer program" exclusion that
       computer programs, as such, could not be foreclosed to the
       public under patent law. (Copyright law is another matter.) They
       would be foreclosed if it was possible to patent a computer when
       running under the instructions of the program, for example, or
       magnetic disk when storing the program.
 
  104. But the mere fact that a claimed artefact includes a computer
       program, or that a claimed process uses a computer program, does
       not establish, in and of itself, that the patent would foreclose
       the use of a computer program. There are many artefacts that
       operate under computer control (e.g. the automatic pilot of an
       aircraft) and there are many industrial processes that operate
       under computer control (e.g. making canned soup). A better way
       of doing those things ought, in principle, to be patentable. The
       question to ask should be: is it (the artefact or process) new
       and non-obvious merely ''because'' there is a computer program? Or
       would it still be new and non-obvious in principle even if the
       same decisions and commands could somehow be taken and issued by
       a little man at a control panel, operating under the same rules?
       For if the answer to the latter question is 'Yes' it becomes
       apparent that the computer program is merely a tool, and the
       invention is not about computer programming at all. It is about
       better rules for governing an automatic pilot or better rules
       for conducting the manufacture of canned soup.
 
  105. Of course, if it were about better rules for running a business
       the idea would not be patentable.

(Note that these are both High Court decisions -- ie routine patent case 
decisions, not Appeal Court decisions.  But even High Court decisions 
involving software patents are very very rare).

The discussion of Art 52 EPC in Halliburton starts at paragraph 207.   
The case didn't turn on Art 52: the judge principally threw out the 
patent on the grounds of insufficient disclosure.

Regarding Art 52, the judge held that the creation of a design for a 
drill bit was a mental act as such; but creation of the design and 
subsequently using it to make the drill bit was a technical process.

This is very close to FFII thinking.  What was new was bringing in a new 
principle to the creation of drill bits, namely balancing the forces to 
reduce uneven wear, which had not previously been systematically 
achieved before.  This is (literally!) a teaching about using the forces 
of nature in a different way to that previously achieved, use of the 
teaching defining a new distinctive characteristic of drill bits, which 
identifies a new class of drill bits which correspond to the patent's 
teaching.

Ironically, it's therefore very analogous to 
[[http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/ippd/issues/cii-workshops-case.htm|case study 11 in the UKPO workshops]] 
which the UKPO criticised FFII's definition for, because most workshop 
participants thought this application would be allowed under the FFII-UK 
Forces of Nature definition, whereas the UKPO thought it should not..   It seems the 
High Court agrees with the participants!

Where I think Judge Pumfrey is not right is his identification of Art 52 
EPC as concretising the requirement for "susceptibility of industrial 
application".   He's reading the words "inventions within the meaning of 
paragraph 1" in Art 52(2) as equal to "inventions which are susceptible 
of industrial application, which are new and which involve an inventive 
step" in Art 52(1),  (ie "patentable inventions" ?),  rather than the 
word "inventions" in Art 52(1) by itself.

It's an interesting reading, but IMHO off the mark, because I think the 
Art 52(2) test and the "susceptible of industrial application" test have 
come to mean different things.   Instead I think the mainstream view 
would be to read the classes in Art 52(2) as not inventions __even if__ 
they are susceptible of industrial application.
