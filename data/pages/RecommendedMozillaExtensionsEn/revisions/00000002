[ Back: [[http:IrcEn]] ]

Most important extensions:

[[https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=436|Session Saver]]
saves your current Mozilla Window with tabs and restores this
set of tabs when you start mozilla. This even works after hard system crashes because
of power interruption for example. It has a limit of tabs which it will restore, so don't open 20 windows with 20 tabs each ;)
----
The [[https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&os=Windows&id=16|Chatzilla extension]] is an IRC client for Mozilla. After installting it and restarting the browser, you can open the IRC with this URL: irc://freenode/bxl-ffii 
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=483|SubmitToTab]] - sometimes you may want to submit a form to a new tab
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=452|Surfbook]] - History only saves page loads, but this makes a log of pages seen
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=841|openselectedlinks]] - to open all selected links, saves a lot clicking if you want to open a list of links at once 
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=437|HashColouredTabs]] - gives tabs with no favicon a color hash -
When your tab bar becomes full of tabs, you often have to rely on seeing the website icons to tell which website is loaded inside which tab. But not all websites have predefined icons. This extension will give each tab an icon that is coloured depending on the web address from which it is loaded.
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=743|CustomizeGoogle]] - CustomizeGoogle is a Firefox extension that enhance Google search results by adding extra information (like links to Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, MSN etc) and removing unwanted information (like ads and spam). All features are optional and easily configured from the options menu. - allows you to add regexps for filtering google results, besides many other things
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=241|Disable Targets For Downloads]] -  Prevents sites spawning blank windows when clicking binary downloads.
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=625|Tab Mix]] is the best of the Tabbed browsing extensions - Note: It's default configuration is annoying: It's default action when closing a tab is to select the left-most tab. If you rather like the default, which is to view the tab which is right of the closed tab, then, after restarting the browser, go to "Tools" -> "Tab Mix Options" -> "Events" -> "When closing current tab focus: " - select "right" here. Also look at the options in the other config tabs, quite useful. In it's configuration you can also enable a menu item "Undo Close Tab", which includes the functionality which undoclosetab provides independent of Tab Mix:
----
Undoclosetab - allows you do undo the last close of a tab, the menu with this new menu item opens if you right-click in the tab bar. [[http://mozilla.dorando.at/undoclosetab.xpi|Installation for Mozilla 1.04]]
----
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=59|User Agent Switcher]] - see the WWW with new eyes, e.g. after changing the user agent to "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)", you can see URLs like http://www.netzwerk.de/fantom/hallo like google sees it, a completely different experiance...
