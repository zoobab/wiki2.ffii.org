== Introduction ==

[:JoopNijssenEn: Joop Nijssen], civil servant with the Dutch delegation in Brussels, said in an article in the [http://www.iht.com/articles/528268.html International Herald Tribune] that "Brinkhorst did not feel obliged to change his approval for the Council text into an abstention" as a consequence of the voted [:NlMot040701En: motion]. The Dutch online magazine [http://www.netkwesties.nl NetKwesties] called him to ask for a clarification. The Dutch article can be found [http://www.netkwesties.nl/editie103/artikel3.php here], below is a translation of the important part.

== Article text ==

  "Substantially, it's correct what the article says, but the lady of the IHT did represent
  it somewhat over-simplified", he [:Joop :Nijssen] says. "The Council proposal has already
  been voted on, that vote cannot be reversed. For that, you would have to ask a new
  vote, and the motion doesn't go that far. The proposal only still has to be signed. We
  are waiting for the translations. But that signing is just a procedural matter. According
  to the rules you cannot deviate from a previous vote. It's a done deal. The Netherlands
  cannot retract its support now."

  But the proposal comes back to the EU-ministers after the second reading by the European
  Parliament. So when this occurs, the Netherlands will abstain based on the motion? "No,"
  Nijssens states, "we will then take into account the motion when taking a decision."

  But "taking into account" is not the same as abstaining, is it? So the motion is wasted
  energy? Nijssen replies in a cool way: "We will bring the standpoints it contains under
  the attention of the other EU member states. How we will do that is not yet known."

  As it happens, they still have to decide at the ministry of Economic Affairs what to do
  with the motion, which was only opposed by the VVD. "We still have to look how to
  implement the motion," sounded the information echo well of EA for three times.
  "That can happen in different ways," the spokeswoman of the ministry says.

  Which way for example? "I don't know yet. Maybe there will be clarity next week."

== Analysis  ==

It's possible that when Mr Nijssen said he could not say yet whether the Netherlands would abstain after the second reading of the EP, he referred to the fact that nobody knows yet what kind of text will come from the EP. However, the fact that they still have absolutely no idea how to fulfill the [:NlMot040701En: motion], even though it's quite clear, seems to indicate they are trying to find ways to get around their democratic obligations to fulfill it.

Mr Nijssen is however wrong in stating that the signing is merely a procedural matter, since, as he indicates himself, a new vote could be opened, and countries can still make statements about items on the agenda (which, if such a statement leads to further discussion, may even cause the relevant item to be withdrawn from the agenda). He claims that a new vote was not called for by the Dutch Parliament. However, the Parliament did ask that the Netherlands abstain from voting. Mr Nijssen's view that the signing is procedural, and that the vote in the Competitiveness Council in May is the definitive vote is a matter of convention, not "the rules". EU procedural regulations [:ConsReversEn: clearly allow] the May vote (which was an expression of political intent) to be changed in during the formal adoption of the directive by the Council. 

It should be noted that the Dutch Parliament 
[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/nl/vosn01/ decided already in 2001], 
based on a consensus of all industry players and a nearly anonymous vote, that there should be no software patents and forces of nature should be part of any problem solution for which a patent is granted.  At the time, the ministerial officials sneered at the Parliament's decision and pursued an opposite course in the Council and moreover lied to the Parliament about this.  When Nijssen this time says that he will follow the Parliament's view in a second reading, he has little credibility.  Yet, ministerial officials in the Netherlands, as elsewhere, are used to deciding legislative matters among themselves.  In their eyes, neither the Parliament nor their minister has any authority.  Instead they listen to authorities such as the patent department of [:SwpatphilipsEn: Philips] and the Dutch Patent Office and rely on them to provide 
[:NlGovLttr0406En: shoddy economic analysis] for which any student in the first semester of economics would get an F grade.  Yet, ministers of economy such as [:LaurensJanBrinkhorstEn: Brinkhorst] nod off such proposals without criticism, because their career usually depends more on the good will of the civil servants than on that of the parliament.
