(We start in silence, and the following words fade in)

    One day, the European Commission made a proposal that could have
    a profound effect on the future of innovation in Europe.

(Fade out, fade in, might also show a photograph from demos together
with the text below.)

    Some said it was essential to the European software industry.
    Others claimed it would be catastrophic.

(Fade out, fade in)

    So the Council carefully considered the issue,
    discussed it in great depth, and made very thoughtful decisions.

(Fade out. At this point, the IE-DK dialogue from the council starts
to play, http://www.itia.ntua.gr/~anthony/tmp/soundtrack.ogg. The text
below then fades in so that the audience follow the dialogue on their
screen.)

    Irish Chairman: Belgium: abstain.

                    And Denmark? Can I hear from Denmark please?

    Denmark: I would really like to ask the commission why they couldn't
             accept the last sentence put forward by the Italians, which
             was in the original German proposal.

    Ireland: I think the Commissioner already answered that question, I'm
             sorry Denmark. So are you yes, no, abstain?

    Denmark: I think we wouldn't, we're not hap...

    Ireland: I assume you're a "yes".

    Denmark: We're not happy.

    Ireland: Are you 80% happy?

    Denmark: But... I think we...

    Ireland: We don't need you to be totally happy. None of us are
             totally happy.

    Denmark: Oh, I know that, I know that.

    Ireland: If we were, we wouldn't be here!

    Denmark: I think we're not very happy, but I think we would, we would...

    Ireland: Thank you very much.

    Denmark: ... we would like to see a solution today.

    Ireland: Thank you very much, Denmark.

             Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm happy to say that we have a qualified
             majority, so thank you all very very much indeed, and thank you
             to commissioner Bolkestein.

  contribution of the following companies to specific elements of the
  Irish Presidency:" to Microsoft) when the Chairman is speaking.

(Last part of dialogue fades out. Then we fade in again, in silence.)

    Why was the Irish Chairman so eager to get Denmark's support?

(Fade out, fade in.)

    Get the facts. Find the answers.

Note: We've deleted part of the discussion between the last "Thank
you very much, Denmark" and "Ladies and Gentlemen". It doesn't change
the meaning, because in between these two it is only said that Spain and
Austria are "no" and "abstain". So Denmark's votes were the ones that
resulted in the majority.
