Jonathan Schwartz has been the president of Sun Microsystems since 2004-04.  Schwartz has personally applied for business method patents on behalf of Sun and declared in his blog: "I believe in IP. ... Copyright, Trademarks, Patents, I believe in them all. ..." and asserted that patents must be available for "all endeavors from drugs to academic work".  After Sun was badly hit by Kodak's patent lawsuit, Schwartz immediately licensed the patents for 90 million USD.  Later Schwartz wrote that patents, as granted in the US, are giving him the creeps, and that non-obviousness standards should be higher.
