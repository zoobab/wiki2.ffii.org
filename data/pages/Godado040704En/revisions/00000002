[[http://www.godado.it|Godado Italia srl]] has been granted a patent on thesaurus based web searching at the UK Patent Office.
The patent request has been filed on May 30, 2000 and the patent has been granted by the UKPO on February 20, 2004 with number GB2362971.

Godado Italia srl has thereafter filed a request to the European Patent Office (request number: 01112245.4). The [[http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/txt/ep/1160/686/|EPO patent]] has not been granted yet, meanwhile Godado has started a campaign against small companies that host search engines on their sites.

[[http://www.portalino.it|Portalino]], a portal that spreads banking information, is one of the first victims.
They received a Cease and Desist letter to stop providing thesaurus-based search services.
