''The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure sketches what it has achieved so far, where it wants to go and who will be in charge of which tasks at what cost.  This collection of materials in wiki-style will form the basis of printed documents to be presented to potential sponsors.''

== Basic Mass Communication Work ==

 * draw attention to continued EPO malpractise by a campaign of weekly+monthly+yearly nosoftwarepatents.com scandal patents, involving votes, contests, ceremonies, demos.  
 * rapid response to events, initiated by nosoftwarepatents.com campaign manager, with volunteers taking turns as assistants for a limited time (e.g. a week)
   * news are prepared on wiki.ffii.org and quickly integrated into nosoftwarepatents.com and news@ffii.org when important enough
 * Peter Gerwinski as paid [[Nsp0511En| nosoftwarepatents.com campaign]] manager, assisted by volunteers and external advisors

== Communicating with Decisionmakers in Brussels  ==

 * Urgent tasks
   * prevent imposition of EPO practise through Community Patent, see Cpedu0510En
   * dangerous directives such as [[Ipred2En| IPRED2]], Rome II (judicial over-regulation)
   * build connections in CEC et al to prepare for return of swpat issue
   * promote important public goods in Infsoc Framework Program
 * General Purpose
   * free IPR from legislative capture, achieve Lisbon goals
   * gather information, influence issues in an early stage  
   * extend networks, serve political partners with sustained expertise
 * Regular Means
   * regular conference (1-2 times per year)
   * learn about currently attempted regulation of knowledge economy 
   * sollicit research/expertise from FFII community and its periphery
   * provide advice to supporting SMEs and partner organisations
 * Who
   * paid representative Erik Josefsson and volunteers
 * Costs
   * 4000 eur/month for Erik
   * 1000 eur/month for various expenses, including office rent

== Insulating FFII.org from legal dangers ==

 * Currently resource drain due to legal matters is minimal because of our self-censorship.
 * The responsibility for certain legal matters will be inherited by a separate organisational entity this month.  This entity will specialise on dealing with legal matters ie Germany.  FFII, it is proposed, will help raise funds for this entity.
 * Fork out centers of responsibility that are insulated from FFII.org, such as
   * national sections 
   * lawyer organisations that take editorial responsibility (e.g. FFII Publishing Company)
 * We have entrusted KPMG to propose a good scheme for this. 

== National Sections ==

 * Actions need to be taken at a national level for a democratical monitoring of patenting practices, resolutions or laws need to be passed in order to rectify circumvention of EPC or prevent governmental patent officials from signing dangerous intergovernmental proposals. Thus, interactions with national parliaments, governements and other national bodies, for eg. Economic & Social Councils, need to be improved.
 * In some member states there are important non-patent initiatives, e.g. on open standards in public administration or rollback of judicial over-regulation, to be pursued.
 * FFII's national organisational entities with offices need to be registered 
 * Some national initiatives need paid activists and initial funding before they can fund themselves.
 * Some national FFII initiatives need mentors and assistence, such as [[FfiiBrEn| FFII Brasil]] and [[http://ffii.skosi.org/|FFII Slovakia]] (currently set up), see also FfiiRegioEn

== UN  ==

 * WIPO and WSIS work currently handled by André Rebentisch
 * some travel expenses need to be paid

== Economic-Majority.com ==

 * Once the Basic Mass Communication Work is in place, it may become possible to revitalise economic-majority.com according to the MLM-like ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing|Multi-Level-Marketing]]) concept proposed and partially practised last June.
