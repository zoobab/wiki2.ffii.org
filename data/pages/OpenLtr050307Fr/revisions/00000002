''Note: the French translation of the original letter which was on this page can still be found'' [[OpenLtrOrg050307Fr| here]]. ''Although I do not think that anything I wrote there was fundamentally wrong, the criticism on the proposed European Constitution had in fact little to do with what happened in the Council session of 7 March 2005. Although the Constitution does not address the problems which arose there, it would not have made things worse either. Additionally, although it was clear'' [[LtrFfiiCons050308En| we had the rules on our side]], ''they found ways around them anyway. Our primary need is a change of attitude at the Council, and that's completely independent from any treaty or Constitution.''
