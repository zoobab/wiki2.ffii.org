The Real stream is no longer available from EbS, the string
" (Click on Tuesday, go to 9am-10am, and click on 09h43'58'' on the left))" can be removed, there is no such link anymore.

EbS has no archive server yet. It would be a good thing to ask the European Ombudsman to propose such archive, provided
in an open way which can be played on Macintosh and Linux platforms as well.
