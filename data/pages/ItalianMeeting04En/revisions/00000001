[http://www.vrijschrift.nl/Members/awessels/digital-era-paradise-law.pdf The Digital Era needs a Paradise Law] "In 1256, Bologna adopted the Paradise Law, it abolished slavery. It was the first city in the world to do this. The world needs another Paradise Law now, software patents need to be abolished. And there is no better place to talk about this, than Bologna." From Ante Wessels' Bologna speech.


 * The announcement:


Cremona room at the Department of Mathematics
4th and 5th floor.
Piazza di Porta San Donato 5

From emails by prof Renzo Davoli:

"I am waiting for final confirmation.
We should have the following people (I hope to forget noone):
dr. Vittorio Prodi MEP, former president of the Bologna Province
Administration (confirmation pending, I have had a personal phone call,
He is shifting another appointment to join our seminar. He seems to be
very concerned with the topic).
dr. Domenico Zucchetti, Zucchetti s.p.a. owner (maybe he will be busy
but somebody from zucchetti will join the seminar).
Alessandro Rubini (fsfe-i) will join the conference on the internet
stream (I will be his voice - as a loudspeaker "chat" connected).
Antonella Beccaria, member of linux.it and Tech Journalist.
Pietro Suffritti, ing. Davide Dozza, Dr. Dario Rigolin computer professionals
dr. Pierluigi Perri Lawyer.
 
I am contacting others.
The idea is to bring a position from many perspectives (large and small
software houses, professionals, lawyers and university - me)."

Ante Wessels from the Dutch [http://www.vrijschrift.nl/softwarepatenten/ Vrijschrift] foundation will come too.

It has about 240 seats, overhead projector, amplifier and network. There will be a stream.

Co-sponsors of the seminar are:
- FFII.
- Department of Computer Science - University of Bologna
- Master in Free and Open Source Software Technology - AlmaWeb - University of
  Bologna.


And for those that do not make it to Italy :-)

"it is www.cs.unibo.it/~renzo/live
There is a Webcam, audio streaming via icecast/ogg-vorbis,
synchronized html slides (a live UNIX terminal, but this is not needed I
think)."


You may like to join the it-parl list. (www.ffii.org -> what to do) or the bxl list (Brussels lobby).

Friday there will be a press conference in the morning in Milano, with Eva 
Lichtenberger, member of the European Parliament and Fiorello Cortiana, 
member of the Italian Senate. Both very concerned about the topic. They hope 
to reinforce the Italian position.

Have a nice day!
