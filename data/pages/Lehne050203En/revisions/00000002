''3 February 2005 -- Klaus-Heiner Lehne, member of the European Parliament of the German Christian Democratic Union (European People's Party) with a leading role in the Legal Affairs Committee, calls on the European Commission to withdraw the directive project entirely, citing as a reason the inability of the Council to reach an agreement that is backed by a real qualified majority and the fear that public opinion is swaying too far toward restrictions of patentability which he thinks would harm Europe's industry.''
