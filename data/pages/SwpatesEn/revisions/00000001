''The Spanish government has voted No on the Council's software patent agreement, without proposing a clear counter-position.  At the working party level, the Spanish government's work is dominated by its patent office.  Thus, the government's representatives in the Council will act according to the government's will only if that will is expressed in very simple and unambiguous instructions, such as "Vote NO".  Spanish members of Parliament have mostly been critical of software patents but often failed to defend clear exclusions.''
