10:00 till 13:00 at Azenes 16-105, Riga (100+ places), kindly provided by the Construction faculty of the Riga Technical University.

In Riga the room was crowded with about 100 journalists, developers, business persons and students ...

Richard Stallman (RMS) delivered a particularly good speech here.

Good speeches by all three speakers and vital Q+A afterwards!!!
