The [http://www.oecd.org/ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]
is an association of economically developped (rich) nations with headquarters in Paris.

OECD recently took interest in the economic performance of the patent system and its impact on the developped nations that are members of OECD.

The US government, represented by its patent office, appeared rather displeased and said, in the closing speech of Ms Boland, that the US would seek to strenghten and expand the patent system through WIPO, WTO, bilateral agreements or whatever channel seemed suitable for this purpose and would not let OECD get in its way.  In comparison, the representatives of the European Patent Office appeared very enlightened.
