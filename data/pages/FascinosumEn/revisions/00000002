''"Fascinosum" is an unfathomable object which calls for worship and for administration by men of superior knowledge, according to exceptional rules, which, in other contexts, might seem to run counter to common sense.  In much of the conventional wisdom about patents, the term "technical invention" is often misunderstood as referring to this "fascinosum".  Attempts to define the term on rational grounds have been frustrated by an underlying desire to cover all fascinosa by the term.  Programmers and engineers find it difficult to explain that problem-solving is not an other-worldly activity and that the patent magic, by which it is supposedly transformed into tradeable assets, is arbitrary and counter-productive.  The fascinosum seems to be the last major refuge in which certain medieval traditions, such as that of states granting broad monopolies, have been able to survive against the tide of enlightenment.''

== Definitions ==

"The ''fasinosum'' is a feeling of joy, gratitude, pleasure, or onrush of grace, at catching a glimpse of the Ultimate, or numen; the ''tremendum'' is a reaction of awe, horror, fear, or a feeling of being overwhelmed. As in the esthetic experience, both the negative and the positive are seen as valid and therefore endurable" excerpt from [[http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/creativity_and.html|Creativity and Personal Freedom]]
