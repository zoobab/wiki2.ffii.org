== Possible Questions: ==

On July 6th 2005 the European Parliament almost unanimously rejected the        
directive equal to the circumvention clause used by the European patent office
to grant patents on software. The proposal to base the community patent on
the EPO case law circumvents this decision. Is this known by the commission
and what is the position of the commission on this fact.

The debate about software patenting was clearly showing that the developement
of the patent rules in the same institution that is responsible for granting
patents leads to severe problems. We have seen that problems rise again in
the debate on IPRED where the industry neglects the penalties on patent
infringements and where we have to question if criminal sanctions on unforseeable
patent infringement collide with constitutional rights. What is the commissionairs
proposal to prevent the problems we see with the EPO case law in the community
patent?

Mon troisieme point sera de m'associer a la question de mon collegue Zingaretti a l'instant et de demander avec precision a nos trois orateurs, si a leur avis, la protection des logiciels par le droit d'auteur ce qui est le droit d'aujourd'hui, ce qui est l'ecriture de la Convention Europeenne des Brevets est suffisante ou non? en quoi de ne l'est-elle pas? Si nous avons rejete la proposition de la Commission, c'est que la dite Commission n'avait pas reussi a nous convaincre, et que cette protection n'etait pas suffisante. Si nous nous sommes trompes, c'est le moment ou jamais de nous le dire. Nous n'avons pas absolument cette impression. Mais nous sommes des democrates et nous savons ecouter, je suis prets a tout entendre puisque j'etais le rappoteur sur ce sujet chaud.

Question about the patent directive, I am I do think that the copyright system, under current patent if it has technological invention. Ask ourselves, is a new directive on patent. I don't think that this is the case. And that is also my answer to Mr Zingaretti.

Thank you Mr Chairman. to be the most competitive knowledge based and achieving market innovation disseminate economy is developped the use and value will play an increaseable, a tangible. And as such, therefore, and stimulate to grow. Correlation competitiveness and protection of Intellectual property intellectual protection the twenty weakest IP protection were among the bottom of this list. There is a recent survey stressed for their welfair, only have patents as a strategically pa. In patent fillings, 7% increase compared to 2003. Filling rates of patents, in Europe. if one compare Japan and the United States, was more then twice then the European Patent Office. With certain legal certainty the need to further iomprove the legal certainty. Despite are worrying signals the need of users when they discuss in Europe in Japan and in the United States and this brings to optimise growth in this area, IP rights increasing the knowledge . SImilar developments can be seen in the united States, to meet the needs. turning back to Europe. basically nowhere, have been unable to agree on a Community Patent wit ha trully unite affordable and competitive and co-exists with the present legal certainty, court system. As I said, nowhere, no EU presidency this issue, national priorities, tool that nobody will use, afforidable, high quality, a was far away from acchieving. Key importance for two costs and legal certainty the contracting states of the EPC Lodon agreement taking into account 3 times and approx 5 times . Londo agreement to enter into force, will ratify the agreement clearly prooves are very rarely used. Why there are a heavy financial burden, especially for SMEs, on the debate of the Community Patent, appeal to all contracting states. There is no need is also key. UNICE has from setting up, common rules of procedure, and validity issues, which is subject European Patent Litigation Agreement, vital for companies independant of any . Therefore, while avoiding, in terms of procedures and content. With the appropriate experience, it could also help. Therefore, it would be for industry in the enforcement and among EPC members states coming to effect. We do not see EPLA and this is why a pro-active stance in successfully which are also blocked. Where can we go from. One issue, trying to get which does not enjoy full time being. Address knowledge based economy, and should not be regarded as a , this tangible goal, based on each other practice ...

  Both Directive 2004/48/EC and the current proposals seem to have been

  These are flawed assumptions.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                         
  We would define piracy as: any natural or legal person who exploits

  it is essential that those who receive the protection of the law are

  proposals do not address this fundamental point.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                            
  Some examples of what we mean may be helpful.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                  
  There are instances where rights-holders pay a royalty which any                                                                                                         
  reasonable analysis would see as grossly unfair. For example, the

  Which brings us to a really big question:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                           
  If it is illegal in the EU to exploit IP without remuneration to                                                                                                         
  creators and rights-holders, shouldn?t it also be illegal to refuse                                                                                                      
  to exploit it and to refuse to allow anyone else to do so, even the                                                                                                      
  creators themselves?                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                         
  We say ? yes ? that should be illegal.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                           
  In such cases the IP should revert to the creator so they can arrange                                                                                                    
  for it to be exploited. Otherwise, you?re preventing people from
