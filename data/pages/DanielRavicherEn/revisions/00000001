  OSRM's team includes "director of legal research" Pamela
  Jones, a paralegal who runs a SCO-bashing Web site called
  Groklaw, and "lead patent counsel" Daniel Ravicher, a
  29-year-old lawyer in private practice who last year started
  a foundation that claims half of the patents in the United
  States are illegitimate.

  Ravicher, who performed the patent analysis that turned up
  Linux's 283 possible patent violations, claims on his Web
  site that he has "extensive experience litigating,
  licensing, prosecuting and otherwise counseling clients with
  respect to patents." In fact, he has three years of
  experience as an associate at two law firms in New York and
  has never acted as lead counsel on any patent litigation.

  Ravicher's online bio also claims that he "practiced law" at
  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, one of the country's
  most prestigious law firms. Actually, he spent eight weeks
  at Skadden as a summer intern while he was still attending
  law school.
