 * Jozéf Halbersztadt [http://w1.401.telia.com/~u40120948/misc/april2004revised.pdf contribution (English)]

 I will show two highly topical patent cases where different interpretations of international treaties
 are clearly exposed. From analysing the claims, we can make plausible conjectures about which types
 of patents will be granted and enforced in various jurisdictions.

 * Adrian Lozano [http://www.xenotype.com/kwiki/index.cgi?Presentation contribution (English)]

 I will present a prototype of a database that contains approximately 20.000 granted european software
 patents.  The database is designed to increase accessibility and facilitate classification of software
 patents. The system will use Bayesian filtering and wiki-like tagging to achieve that goal. Possible
 extentions are correlations with other data, like R&D intensity and company size and an interactive
 interface similar to mail client spam filters.

 * Bernd Herd [http://www.herdsoft.com/Einkommenseinbussen%20durch%20Softwarepatente.html contribution (German)] [http://www.herdsoft.com/Losses_caused_by_software_patents.html English translation]

 I will focus on real world experience of commercial software development from a SME perspective in the
 present minefield of EPO granted patents. Hands-on experiences with patent mines in e.g. the fields of
 geographical data analysis, data compression, and full text indexing illustrate the risks and deadlocks
 by real-world licensing practices as well as granting practices. The examples serve to illustrate the
 necessity of legal security and patent law clarity (like Parliament article 6a) and show the many ways
 in which patents cause extra costs to software developers.

 * Burak Canboy

 I am CEO of a shareware company specialized in compression software. We are market leaders in Europe and
 have 2 million downloads per month and growing. Our busines model is successfully built on copyright and
 beeing ahead of competitors. A serious problem is that small parts of programs are patented. Future
 companies might end up in a situation where they don't know which parts. You might then recieve letters
 from companies wanting money for licencing things you wrote yourself.
	
 * Roland Orre and Joerg Wittenberger [http://kwiki.ffii.org/?Gxl44Pa (merged contributions)]

 To a computer scientist data processing lies very close to the
 concept of the Turing machine. To us the Parliament article 3a:

   "3a. Member states shall ensure that data processing is not
   considered to be a field of technology in the sense of patent law,
   and that innovations in the field of data processing are not
   considered to be inventions in the sense of patent law."

 is similar to a set of Turing compatible processes being excluded
 from patentability. Taking non-patentability of Turing processes for
 granted, an AI approach to software solutions, business models and
 marketing/manufacturing processes may give new insights.

 Remebering historical more or less successfull attempts to exhaust spheres
 of patentable subject matter from patent claims, like "public patents pools"
 and "defensive publication" (also called "patent profylax"), we hope our
 proposal will open a new way to use the patent system as to make the patent
 system achieve it's goals: to stimulate the shaping of standards in design
 and knowledge representation and stimulate cooperation between researchers
 and companies. Maybe this "workaround" will not be necessary in Europe, but
 the US need is obvious.
