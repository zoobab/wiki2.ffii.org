The WIPO has started to explain what was their role, basically that they only make proposals for treaties, and only member states are free to sign or not.

The introduction session was followed by some discussions about the future participation of !NGOs and an interesting discussion about "Copyrights on the internet". The various NGO represented there had the opportunity to ask questions notably related to EUCD/DMCA, Broadcast flag, and software patents.

The presentations of WIPO officials were very general and diplomatic.

Regarding the economic side of the impact of their decisions, Sherif Saadallah, executive director of WIPO,  said that "economists in the field of impacts of IP were rare and costly", which shows that they are little competent for assessing the economic impacts of extension of rights.
