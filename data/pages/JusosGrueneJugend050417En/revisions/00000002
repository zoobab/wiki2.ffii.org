''In a joint statement of Grüne Jugend and Jusos these German party Youth organisation critizise the Council Common position and recommend to adhere to the results of the first reading in EU-Parliament in the second reading.''

 
== Joint Statement of Grüne Jugend and Jusos ==

As the Common Position was adopted in violation of the rules of procedure
of the Council, we demand that the results of the 1st
reading should be passed, which would mean an
effective limitation of software patents (and we thus
agree with the demands of the Bundestag (German
parliament)). The Council of Ministers presents its
changes as 'cosmetic', but these changes would in
actual fact widely facilitate the patenting of
software.

For major parts of the European software industry this
would represent a significant economic threat, or at
least being dependent on patent-holding corporations,
with most (more than 70%) of the software patents
issued in the EU being in the hands of US or Japanese
companies. As a consequence, the software market would
become increasingly monopolised and thus less
competitive, which would be detrimental to all
consumers.

Our development of society leads towards a knowledge-based society, computer program gain importance in every aspect of our economic life. However, by software patents their flexibility and utility decreases. In the future we can expect a continuos informatisation of the workplace  and therefore this directive will habe impact on our future. Software patents lead to a monopolisation of knowledge and are further unnessary since Software is already being protected by copyright and adequate informal measures of protection (secrecy of the code etc.).
