In preparation of the CEAPME conference in Istanbul, we need to get a quick overview of FFII's involvement with SMEs, our work so far and the upcoming tasks.

== FFII as a link between Civil Society, Science and SMEs ==

 * [[http://www.ffii.org/#misio|Mission statement]] contains reference to entrepreneurs
 * [[http://www.ffii.org/assoc/home/|Endorsed as speaker on IP matters by 1200 SMEs]]
 * centering on net-based education, alliance between SMEs, science &  civil society
   * [[http://eu.ffii.org/sections/bxl0411/|recent conference of FFII+MERIT+CEAPME]] illustrates this
 * board has given green light for associate membership in CEA-PME
   * working together daily in Bxl office, need to broaden and intensify, here to learn


== Areas of Concern for SMEs and FFII ==

=== Preventing Monopolism & Proprietarisation of Infrastructures ===

 * open standards important, skeptical about vendor lock-in of Microsoft & the like
 * in favor of an [[IndpropEn| integrated system of Intellectual Property which is fast, cheap and narrow]], critical of patents
 * critical of activities that raise state quota, for lean taxation systems, low or no taxes on information goods, but positive about state involvement in basic research, open infrastructures and education
 * cautiously skeptical about some extensions to the free trade agenda that deprive local communities of their space of maneuver and tend to favor monopolistation by big players.  GATS and Bolkestein Service Directive have this aspect.
 * need to learn more about these things 

=== Counter-Balancing Legislative Capture by Professional Groups ===

 * patent lawyers have been speaking in the name of large companies without many people noticing
 * Large companies have more specialised departments than SMEs
 * Grassroots education efforts with Internet means
 * Conferences with MERIT, CEAPME et al


=== Communicating with our Supporters  ===

 * This section will be moved to SarjiEn soon
 * 1200 corporate supporters in [[MlhtDbEn| database]]
   * registered mostly through [[AktivEn| aktiv]]
