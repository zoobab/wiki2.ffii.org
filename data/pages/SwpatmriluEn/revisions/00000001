Where the Slippery Slope of software patents will slide...

My dear European friends:

If the destructive process of software patents continues, your software jobs will go to China, Russia, India, Romania, etcetera. Companies in those countries will escape enforcement of your patents and not pay one red cent! 

Large software companies do not need patents if they simply do not publish their source code. On the other hand, they will reveal their precious ideas in the patent application, which will be freely exploited by those countries who will ignore the patent 'right' - which is clearly counterproductive to the common good.
