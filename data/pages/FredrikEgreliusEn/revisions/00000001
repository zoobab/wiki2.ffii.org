''A patent lawyer who was hired by Scania with the task of promoting software patenting within the company, based on the assumption that this is the future to which the company must adjust.  Mr Egrelius is also a member of Swedish Enterprise software patent working group together with Mrs. Therese Kreuer and Mr. Walo von Greyerz (former Ericsson, now Bird& Bird associate).  Mr. Egrelius' job at Scania depends on a growth in importance of patents for the automobile industry.   Thus Egrelius has been rallying the automobile industry for the cause of software patentability and acted as their representative in lobbying the EU Council and the European Parliament since 2003 or earlier.''

== Argumentation for Program Claims ==

 * [:DilabProg04En: program claim arguments]: Egrelius has been vehemently promoting program claims, saying that Scania needs control over an imaginary future market where new truck functionalities are realised by inserting a new program disk into an existing automobile motor, insisting that neither copyright nor pursuit as indirect patent infringment can be enough for this market.  Although this text takes an example from a small Swedish company, it is mostly Egrelius who is pushing this kind of argument in Sweden.
