== Question 1: Cost of patent cases before the European Patent Judiciary set up under the EPLA ==

  WRITTEN QUESTION E-3582/06
  by Michel Rocard (PSE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject: Cost of patent cases before the European  Patent  Judiciary  set
  up under the EPLA
  
  Page 13 of the  European Patent Office's assessment of the impact of the
  European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA), dated February 2006, shows
  that the minimum costs of a medium-scale patent case brought before the
  future European Patent Court at first instance are barely lower than the
  costs if the same case were brought simultaneously in Germany, France and
  the Netherlands and that the minimum costs of a case at second instance are
  barely lower than those of simultaneously bringing the same case before a
  court in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
  
  Given that SMES can often afford to bring only one case at a time, and have
  to rely on the settlement of that case in order to have the funds to bring
  another if need be, how does the Commission justify this rise in the cost
  of litigation, both in itself but primarily with regard to the interests of
  SMEs?

== Question 2: Separation of powers within the European Patent Judiciary set up under the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement) ==

 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3581/06
 by Michel Rocard (PSE)
 to the Commission
  
  Subject: Separation of powers within the European  Patent  Judiciary  set
  up under the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement)
  
  A Community system for settling patent disputes can only exist if it is
  fully part of the European legal order and is completely independent of the
  legislature and the executive, in line with the principle of separation of
  powers.
  
  It follows that judges called on to issue rulings within the European
  Patent Judiciary may not concurrently hold or have held a post in the
  various chambers of the European Patent Office or within national offices
  responsible for issuing patents.
  
  What steps has the Commission taken or does it intend to take in this
  regard?

== Question 3: Case law and innovation policy within the European Patent Judiciary set up under the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement) ==

  WRITTEN QUESTION E-3580/06
  by Michel Rocard (PSE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject: Case law  and  innovation  policy  within  the  European  Patent
  Judiciary set up under the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement )
  
  A series of case-law decisions by the Technical Appeal Board of the
  European Patent Office has led to the issuing of software patents and
  patents on business methods (which correspond to USPTO Class 705).
  
  Does the Commission agree that the inclusion of software within the
  parameters of patentability was not a 'technical' decision but a
  substantial change to patent law, which is outside the jurisdiction of any
  court, and that decisions of this kind need to be dealt with appropriately
  at a political level, i.e. they must take the form of legislation?
  
  What mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with regard to
  the EPLA to ensure that similar excesses do not occur?
