Newell, Allen (1985-1986), "Response: The Models Are Broken, the Models Are Broken", University of Pittsburgh Law Review 47: 1023-1031.

 * "I think fixing the models is an important intellectual task. It will be difficult. The concepts that are being jumbled together--methods, processes, mental steps, abstraction, algorithms, procedures, determinism--ramify throughout the social and economic fabric....The task is to get...new models. There is a fertile field to be plowed here, to understand what models might work for the law. It is a job for lawyers and, importantly, theoretical computer scientists. It could also use some philosophers of computation, if we could ever grow some." (p. 1035.)
