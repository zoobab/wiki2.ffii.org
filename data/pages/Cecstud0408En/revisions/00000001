 * Tender by DG Information Society
 * Study into effects of allowing patents claims for computer-implemented invention
 * Description/object of the contract:  "The Commission has proposed a directive (COM(2002) 92; (2002) 47 COD) which would provide a legal basis for the patenting of 'computer-implemented inventions'. This directive has been widely debated and interpreted as a possible solution for the legal ambiguity and lack of certainty that surrounds the patenting of computer programs, until now excluded under the European Patent Convention, though, in practice, granted by both the European Patent Office and by some national patent offices. The main objective of this study is to set up an independent longitudinal survey to understand the effect of computer-implemented inventions on the software sector under a technical, economic and legal point of view."
 * Total quantity or scope: "The maximum budget for this study is 500000 EUR for a period of 36 months."
