----
The [http://swpat.ffii.org/ Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]
has been carrying a pan-European campaign agains patentability of software
in the European Union for some years now.
The opposition of free software communities to this
kind of patents, as found in the USA and other
countries, has often been asserted; it is due time

silly patents abound), while true, are not clear enough.
The author explains the motives of the pro-patent field in

which should stand out
as a reference for those uninitiated in the black arts
of free software.
