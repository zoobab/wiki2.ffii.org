''The US-based company Eplus owns (at least) three patents on basic electronic commerce processes.  Patents have been filed both in the US and Europe and have been validated by courts in the US.  Eplus claims to have received a payment of $37 million USD from one competitor (Ariba) and is now "vigorously asserting its property rights" against others, including SAP.  Both the US and the EP base patent took nearly 10 years to examine.  The European one is broader than its US cousin.  It seems to cover all efficient ways of purchasing an article from a catalog.''

According to an [[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/07/28/newscolumn9.html|interview]] that Ken Farber (president of ePlus software division) gave in 2003:  "We don't want to be applying for patents all the time, but if we have something worth protecting, we're going to protect it," Farber says.

After the patents were granted, ePlus was not quite sure if they should use them in lawsuits, at least that is what Ken Farber told [[http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=10818143|here]]:

  Although ePlus has yet to file a lawsuit alleging infringement
  of the patent, "we're keeping our eyes and ears open, and we'll
  make an appropriate decision to defend our rights," president
  Ken Farber says.

In May 2004, ePlus filed suit against [[http://www.ariba.com|Ariba]]. The law firm Hunton & Williams, (the company that also represented MercExchange against eBay for patent infringement), initially asked for $89 million USD in damages. The court awarded $37 million USD. With this verdict ePlus now bets its patents again by attacking SAP.

As we can see from court documents, SAP seems to be frightened that ePlus might use this case to lay its hands on SAP internal documents, strategies and pending patents:

  SAP states that counsel for ePlus will have
  access to very sensitive and confidential
  information such as strategies for intellectual
  property rights, ongoing patent applications,
  and plans for further products.

  [...]

  SAP asserts that its continued success is
  predicated on its competitively sensitive
  information, which it cannot risk falling
  into the hands of ePlus or its competitors. 

These questions also played a role in the ePlus vs Ariba case, where Ariba was frightened of the same. This gives the whole case an interesting twist. Does this case serve its goal of patent protection or does this case also serve as method of information collection about competitors? SAP seems to be afraid of the latter.

Jan Wildeboer, FFII member comments:

  This is yet another example of an overly broad patent
  that can be used to effectively monopolize a market.
  It took ePlus years to get these patents granted and
  it is unclear why it took so long. But now that they
  have won their first case it seem the complete market
  of purchasing goods is at risk.

  The european patent is even broader. Althought at this
  time SAP is only sued in USA for patent infringement,
  the risk of a european case is growing.

  Seeing the rise of catalog exchange systems like ebXML,
  cXML etc. it remains to be seen if all these open
  standards are now at risk. SAP thinks the patents are
  invalid. That position gets a 100% ACK from me. Let's
  hope the judge in this case knows what he is deciding.

  SAP AG confirmed it is being sued in a Richmond, Virginia
  court by US-based software maker ePlus, which claims the
  German company infringed upon three of its software patents.

  An SAP spokesman said the charges were filed in April.

  He said that SAP denies it infringed upon any of ePlus patents
  and that it has filed a countersuit against the US company.

  In addition, SAP said it does not believe ePlus's patents are valid.

  EPlus charges SAP with patent infringement
  Software startup alleges SAP infringed on three
  patents for e-commerce-related technologies

  [...]

  "We confirm the lawsuit but deny any patent infringement,"
  an SAP spokesman said Thursday.

  [...]

  On June 15, SAP, in Walldorf, Germany, filed an Answer and
  Counterclaims, arguing that it had not infringed on the ePlus
  patents and that the patents were invalid.

  The case is set for trial in March 2006.

  The patent suit is at least the second from ePlus this year.
  In February, the Herndon, Virginia, company collected $37 million
  in settlement money against e-commerce rival Ariba, after
  initially seeking damages of up to $98 million.


== History ==

In 2003 ePlus was proud to announce their third patent, according to their [[http://www.eplus.com/web/brochures/eplus_2003_Annual_Report.pdf|annual report]]:

  In January, we were awarded a third U.S. patent (No. 6,505,172),
  entitled Electronic Sourcing System. As the third patent in our
  repository of intellectual software property, it may provide
  protection against infringement of our software dating back to
  August 1994.

At that time ePlus was careful to raise expectations from patent litigation, as can be seen on page 18:

  We currently have four patents, three in the United States and
  one in nine countries in Europe, each regarding our electronic
  sourcing and catalog searching. We cannot provide any assurance
  that any patents, as issued, will prevent the development of
  competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully
  challenged by others or invalidated through administrative
  process or litigation.

This position has changed. They are now quite sure of their patents and they have also seen that "competitors" develop competing products. Common sense suggests that competitors do exactly that - compete in the market. But ePlus thinks that its patents may allow them to change that a bit.

In the [[http://www.eplus.com/web/Brochures/ePlus_2005_Annual_Report_FINAL.pdf|2005 annual report]] of ePlus we find:

  IN 2005 WE SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT
  against a formidable competitor. ePlus received a $37 million
  cash settlement after a favorable jury verdict finding that
  ePlus three patents were willfully infringed and not invalid.
  We continue to invest in our growing portfolio of intellectual
  property and related software and business process solutions 
  that incorporate our patents. Our software and intellectual
  property have applicability in all aspects of our business and
  give us a competitive edge in our IT sales, services, and leasing
  businesses. They are the result of many years of dedication,
  substantial investment, and early innovation to meet the needs
  of our customers in numerous markets, and we will defend them vigorously.

The "formidable competitor" was Ariba:
