''On several occasions, Commissioner'' !McCreevy ''has noted that he will not present a new version of the software patentability directive should the European Parliament reject it in its second reading. He presents it as "respecting their wishes", although it clearly runs counter to what the EP wants to achieve. At the same time, in the context of the services directive, the Commissioner noted that "we must guard against people who are lulled in defending the interests of the status quo".''

EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy [[http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/05/151&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|announced]] the following in the European Parliament Plenary in Strasbourg on 8 March 2005:

 "If the parliament decides to reject it, 
  then the Commission will respect your wishes. 
  I will not propose a new directive."
This announcement was later confirmed in [[http://swpat.ffii.org/log/05/mccreevy0311/mccreevy050311.pdf|a letter]] to the Chairman of the EP's Legal Affairs Committee. This statement seems to be an attempt to reduce the choices of the Parliament's in its second reading, to an extent that some may even call blackmail.

## recitals 10 and 21 are extremely bad (jmaebe)

The European Parliament has at no time ever stated that it does not want a clarifying directive on software patents. On the contrary, it expressed its opinion explicitly and very clear in the [[http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=CALDOC&FILE=20030924&LANGUE=EN&TPV=DEF&LASTCHAP=31&SDOCTA=2&TXTLST=2&Type_Doc=ANNEX&POS=1|amended directive proposal]] which it adopted in first reading, for example in recitals 5, 6, 8, 9 and 19. It demonstrated its full awareness of the urgency and required legal certainty, and until now never deviated from this opinion  in even the slightest way.

However, the Commissioner now gives the impression that the Parliament, by rejecting the current in text in second reading,  would indicate that it does not want any such law. As such, the Commissioner clearly wants to dissuade the EP from rejecting by misrepresenting their motive should they do so.

And eventually, for exactly the same reason the Commissioner's threat can hardly be true. There is no way the Commission could avoid looking for a way to get some harmonised rules introduced sooner or later. The Commission will have to cooperate and undertake the necessary steps to provide the appropriate legal means, most probably by proposing either another directive, or potentially by encouraging new negotiations at the level of the European Patent Convention.

It is particularly interesting to note what the Commissioner [[http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/05/148&format=HTML&aged=0=EN&guiLanguage=en|said later on]] about the services directive:
  
 "We must guard against people who are lulled into 
  defending the interests of the status quo. (...)
  I hope to be able to come up with the best solution 
  possible, based on the broadest consensus, because 
  that is what we and Europe need."
Why then would this not apply to the software patents directive? There is no broad consensus about the current version of the software patents directive. Its solutions are determined to be inadequate in [[EPDGEcoSci050216En| study]] after [[Rossi050310En| study]]. And as McCreevy's predecessor Bolkestein said about the status quo:

  The proposed directive does not aim to abolish this
  [EPO] practice nor to extend it. [..] The proposal
  [[of |the Commission]] seeks to harmonise and to clarify;
  but nothing will become patentable which is not already
  patentable now.
The EPO practice already allows [[http://webshop.ffii.org|software and business methods]].

The software sector deserves a proper directive just as much as the services sector.

==== AndrÃ© Rebentisch ====

It happened before. Frits Bolkestein defended his approach at the plenary before the vote (2003-09-23) 
 Anything which imposes unreasonable demands, given the limited resources at the Commission's 
 disposal, could not meet with our approval. The need to remain within the scope of the directive 
 should also be borne in mind. Some of the amendments proposed are too broad in their effects.

 Either we proceed using the Community method or we take a back seat 
 and watch while Member States proceed by means of an intergovernmental 
 treaty. It is clear that proceeding via this Parliament would give 
 European citizens a greater say in patent legislation, an area which 
 is so crucial to our economy.

Parliament decided in favour of a good directive that does protect innovations and innovators, a directive
that solves the problem. Frits Bolkestein also said:

 Amendment 18 - the addition of a new paragraph to Article 5, dealing 
 with computer program claims. That is something that the Commission did
 not put into its original proposal. This was not an oversight but 
 something that we considered long and hard. We were concerned that 
 allowing computer product claims was a step on a slippery slope to
  allowing computer programs on their own to be patentable, something 
 that is clearly contrary to the European Patent Convention and to the
 views of the vast majority of the Members who spoke this morning.

Amendment 18 was explicitly rejected by the European Parliament. However, in the Council versions that
Parliaments will face in the second reading program claims were introduced for the first time. And
they had to be - as Bolkestein indicated - worded in a cautious way (Article 5.2).

 A claim to a computer program ...
 shall not be allowed unless ...
 [[condition |that can always be fulfilled]]

The Parliament now has to amend an even worse version with program claims. Given the majority needed !McCreevy's remarks are quite cynical. His option kindly granted to the Parliament is to kill a directive proposal messed up by the Council.
