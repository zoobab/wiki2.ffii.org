''Strasburg, 8 March 2005'' -- The Commissioner for the Internal Market explained the procedure on the software patent directive to members of the European Parliament between 18.00 and 18.45 CET this evening. The issue was mixed up with great concern of !MEPs about the EU Services draft directive. Charlie !McCreevy was humiliated over the Council "adoption". !MEPs expressed great concern about the affront of the new Commissioner to Parliament. In EU Parliament the Council events of yesterday are seen as a severe power struggle rather than a normal issue of political disagreement with the Commission.

Charlie !McCreevy

 Jeannot Krecké, Chair of the Competitiveness Council, already explained to
 the Legal Affairs Committee, the reasons behind the Councils stance. It  
 confirmed its common position, primarily for institutional reasons. The 
 Council wanted to avoid a precedent whereby Member States would be seen to be 
 backing away from a deal they had signed up to in May 2004. The Council 
 confirmed its position to show that a deal is a deal and that it was not 
 creating  a log-jam on this dossier, in an area which is key for innovation.
 Jeannot Krecké noted yesterday, when the Council took its decision, that 
 some Member States had concerns on the substance of the text and that these 
 would be addressed in the second reading.

 The ball is now very clearly in the European Parliaments court. It's for you to decide 
 how you want to play it. I don't have to remind you of the Parliament's rights. We've 
 discussed this in the conference of Presidents. You can of course reject or substantially 
 amend the proposal. If the Parliament decides to reject it, then the commision will respect 
 your wishes. I will not propose a new directive.
 ...
 I know a new wind is blowing on this. This is reflective its position expressed in the 
 council and the parliament and the Commision will take a count of this and respect this.
 ...
 Well, ehh, to the wide ranging ehh a issues raised I could possibly not contribute to all 
 the points. But on the software patents - and I clearly indicate on the software patent -
 the ball is in the court of the European Parliament.
 If the parliament wishes to reject it then the Commission will respect that decision. 

Lichtenberger
 Der Text, der jetzt vom 18. Mai übrig ist hat keine Mehrheit in der derzeitigen Form. 
 Die Einwendungen der Staaten sind bis jetzt unberücksichtigt  geblieben. Ich will keinen
 Machtkampf zwischen Parlament, Rat und Kommission, sondern ich will eine sachliche 
 Behandlung der Einwendungen in dieser Richtlinie. Das erwart ich mir von Ihnen. 

Sophia in 't Veld:
 I have to say that I'm extraordinarily disturbed to learn that behind the back of 
 the European Parliament negotiations are going on with certain member states, or
 in the case of software the standpoint of the Parliament is simply ignored. 
 Secondly, about the content, there is much talk about the Lisbon strategy, the 
 necessity of innovation and stimulation of the European services market (....) 
 Concerning the software, the quality of the legislation must not be made subordinate
 to a power struggle between the institutions; we need innovation and that must not
 be choked by wrong legislation. In short, mister Creevy, one should do more than 
 just show lip service to the Lisbon strategy, and secondly, one should respect the 
 democratic process and the chosen representation of Europe. 

==== Remark: ====

While listening to the recordings, take care what directive project they are talking about: "Services in the internal market" or "swpat directive". 

==== Jan Wildeboer ====

 "Parlament, friss oder stirb", nur etwas freundlicher
 verpackt. Da McCreevy den Restart bereits abgelehnt hat hat er nun
 noch mal bekräftigt zu keiner Kooperation bereit zu sein. Sollte EP
 den jetzigen Stand ablehen gibt es keine neue Richtlinie. Basta.
 McCreevy verpackt sehr freundlich seine Position: Das Parlament kann nur
 rumreden, die Entscheidungen treffen eh wir in der Kommission. Die
 Realität gibt ihm ja leider recht ....
