We have weekly meetings on irc.freenode.net #bxl-ffii.  They are currently scheduled to run from 21:00 to 22:30.  They often run longer.  We believe
with more discipline we can keep things to approximately 1 hour.

The next meeting is  Thu Dec 15 at 21:00 CET

As part of our new discipline, we intend to refuse to discuss topics
not mentioned here. If you want to discuss it, learn to add it.

Please add anything you wish brought up at the meeting here.  Please do not
number your agenda items, as it makes it harder for people to reorder them later.
If you are starting a new agenda, the formatting is like this:

 * here is the first point in your agenda
   * here is a sub point
     * here is a sub sub point

 * and now we have the second point.

     * no: when appealed and I strongly believe someone will come and call for the court. In Germany it is free to call on the BVerfG when it is accepted, else you pay a say 3000 Eur penalty. I do not believe we have to be the ones who go to court.
