The Intellectual Property Committee (Gruppo Propriet√° Intellettuale) of 
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confindustria|Confindustria]], the confederation of Italian employer
associations, has sent a [[ConfindustriaText0411It| letter]] 
with an attached [[ConfindustriaPaper0411It| position statement]]
to the Italian members of the European Parliament.  

In this letter it stresses the importance of "intellectual property"
and says that "patent protection" must extend to software.  In
particular the statement says that [[EubsaProgEn| program claims]]
as reintroduced by Art 5(2) of the 
[[Cons040518En| Council Software Patent Agreement]] 
are vital and that the Parliament must approve this
Council agreement without any amendments.  As might be expected, the
paper supports its claims with the authority of "the industry" rather
than with reasoning.

This is not the first incident. On May 17 2004, Confindustria Lawyers already issued a
UNICE-style patent priest statement: Conf040417En
