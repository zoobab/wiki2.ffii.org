== The patentability of computer-applied inversions (sic) in the European Union ==

Computers have become a main tool for work and gaining access to communication and entertainment all over the world. From the generalized use of the Internet for communication, fun or information, to the tools required to start the engine of a car, use the washing machine, or analyze the results of a medical check, computers have become an essential element of our lives.

In the United Stated, computer patents have on the one hand allowed to innovation to thrive in this area and on the other hand make Bill Gates the richest man in the world. The law is little developed in Europe. There is a directive in force in the European Union that grants intelectual property rights over computer programs. The European Patent Office, located in Munich, has started granting computer patents with caution, without reaching the excessive situation of the United States, where it is even possible to patent a diary schedule or the systematization of a photoshoot.

The proposed European Commission directive on patents on computer-applied inversions that has already finished first reading in the Parliament, has raised unexpected passions for such a technical law. While software authors, of which there are few in Europe as opposed to the US, support the proposed directive, network users, who are many, opposed strongly the directive, fearing that they will be forced to pay for every means of access to the new communication media.

The European Parlament adopted a number of ammendments in first reading that the Council, basically, has not accepted. Definitive adoption will require approval from the Parliament in a second reading. The position doesn't seem very favourable among Members of Parliament to approve the common position in the form adopted by the Council; by the way, while the ![Spanish] PP government supported the original proposal of the Commission, the new socialist government has voted against it in the Council.

The second reading of the proposed directive in the European Parliament, that is now starting, is being polemic throughout the members of the Union. We Members of Parliament who belong to the legal committee, that has powers to deal with the matter, have been lobbied hard from both sides. The result is unknown and the final resolution will require hard work to resolve the differences between the three organizations of the Union: Parliament, Council and Committee.

                                                                        Manuel Medina Ortega, Diputado al Parlamento Europeo, PSOE.
                                                                        Manuel Medina Ortega, European Member of Parliament, PSOE.
