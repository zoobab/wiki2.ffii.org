WIPO has a special project of activities on "IPR and !SMEs" which is mainly concerned aboutpromoting the patent system among small and medium enterprises.  WIPO has published documents that promote software patents claiming that they help spur innovation and economic growth.  Upon demand for explanations, no supporting references to economic studies were given.  FFII is accredited as an observer at WIPO.
