A new interesting model is presented in the German scientific paper
"Wirtschaftsinformatik"

Beimborn, D., Hoppen, N.: A simulative Approach to Determing the
Economic Efficiency of software Patents, in: Wirtschaftsinformatik
46(2004), S. 50-60.

Both are researchers from Frankfurt, Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik. It is a non-partisan approach, which is quite uncommon in this field.

It is a report from ongoing research.

(Note: only few people have access to the paper, so we can just quote comments here)

[:AndreRebentischDe: André Rebentisch]: 

I am not convinced by their model, however it is worth a read. It
IS very difficult to determine the effects of patents on innovation and
model it.

[:ReinierBakelsEn: Reinier Bakels]:

This is the most complicated
economic modeling endeavour I have seen so far. I am sceptic
about such modeling because it starts with simplification and subsequently
'''very''' detailed conclusions are drawn.
