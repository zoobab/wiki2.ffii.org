= International Competition for the Digitalization of the intangible heritage =
Nabi Centre (Seoul) in cooperation with UNESCO and AVICOM:


"Nabi Digital Storytelling Competition of Intangible Heritage" 
Can digital technology enrich the presence of intangible heritage?
Furthermore can it foster true intercultural dialogue among people from different cultures?
How would the new generation react, interact, or even create new forms to express their intangible heritage?

These are the fundamental questions we are asking you to address through the "Nabi Digital Storytelling Competition of Intangible Heritage".

In line with the 21st General Assembly of ICOM (International Council of Museums) (2-8 October 2004, Seoul, Republic of Korea),
Art Centre Nabi is organizing this digital competition, aiming to promote creative interpretations of intangible heritage through the use
of interactive multimedia tools and digital storytelling technologies, with the support of AVICOM, the Korean National Commission for 
 UNESCO (KNCU), and the UNESCO DigiArts Project.

The competition especially seeks to encourage young practitioners in various fields of creativity to reflect on the theme of intangible
heritage and to send project proposals for multimedia productions. The participants are expected to not only discover innovative ways
of virtual artistic expressions but also bring about interactive platforms for a better mutual understanding to intangible heritage and to
living cultural communities.

 

The prize consists of three parts:
1st prize: USD 5000$
2nd prize: USD 3000$
3rd prize: USD 2000$
