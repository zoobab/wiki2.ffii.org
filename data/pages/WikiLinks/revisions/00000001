WikiLinks are formed by two or more words in ''camel-case.'' Camel-Case means nothing more than a word that is built up by an upper-case letter in first position, at least one second upper-case letter and least one lower-case letter. In this Wiki, an upper-case letter can mark the beginning of a WikiLink even when it is not the start of the word itselves.

It is possibly best readable for humans if you do semantically split a WikiLink word into two or more parts by setting the first letter of each part to upper case.
