== Article 1 ==

=== Scope ===

||  number  ||  submitter  ||  recommendation  ||  text  ||
||  ***  ||  Council  ||  -  ||  La presente Directiva establece normas para la patentabilidad de las invenciones implementadas en ordenador.  ||
||  40 = 72 = 93 = 114 = 135 = 158  ||  Rocard / Buzek 1  ||  ++  ||  La presente Directiva establece las normas relativas a la patentabilidad de las invenciones asistidas por ordenador.  ((Change computer-implemented to computer-aided throughout the text))  ||
||  14  ||  JURI 14  ||  +  ||  La presente Directiva establece normas para la patentabilidad de las invenciones asistidas por ordenador.  ||

The term "computer-implemented inventions" suggests that software on its own can be a patentable invention.  The compromise amendments fix this.

If Am 40 does not succeed, it is believed that all stray instances of "computer-aided invention" or "computer-controlled" invention will be "tidied away" when the text is consolidated after the vote -- but this is not confirmed.

== Article 2 (a) ==

=== Definition of CII/CAI ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Council | - | (a) "computer-implemented invention" means any invention the performance of which involves the use of a computer, computer network or other programmable apparatus, the invention having one or more features which are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer program or computer programs; |
| 41 = 73 = 94 = 115 = 136 = 159 | Rocard / Buzek 2 | ++ | "computer-aided invention" means an invention within the meaning of patent law the performance of which involves the use of programmable apparatus; |
| 15 | JURI 15 | + | "computer-aided invention" means an invention the performance of which involves the use of a computer, computer network or other programmable apparatus; |

JURI is already an improvement over the Council text, because it removes the suggestion that all features can be wholly implemented by a computer program (in which case the "invention" would be nothing but a computer program).

The compromise amendment improves this further by noting we are talking about inventions in the sense of patent law (such as the EPC, or national legislations). This is important because in some jurisdictions, the meaning of "invention" has been gradually slipping to mean "anything appearing in a patent claim".

== Article 2 (b) ==

=== Definition of Technical Contribution ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| *** | Council | - |  |
| 16 | JURI 16 | + | |
| 42 = 74 = 95 = 116 = 137 = 160 | Rocard / Buzek 3 | ++ | |

== Article 2 (b)a (new) ==

=== Definition of Field of Technology  ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 17 | JURI 17 | - | "field of technology" means an application domain requiring the use of controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results in the physical world; |
| 43 = 61 = 75 = 96 = 117 = 138 = 161 | Rocard / Buzek 4; EPP: Kauppi, Lehne  | + | (ba) a "field of technology" is a field of applied natural science; |

## The "application domain" of the JURI text is wrong, it's not the application that counts, but the field where knowledge is gained. Suggestion: split out "application"

## The compromise amendment is a high level general definition, which clearly notes that advances in exact sciences (such as mathematics) cannot be called "technological".

Am 43 has gained all-party support

== Article 2 (b)b (new) ==

=== Definition of Field of Technical ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 18 | JURI 18 | + | "technical" means "belonging to a field of technology"; |

uncontroversial

== Article 2 (b)b' (new) ==

=== Definitions of Computer, Data Processing, Computer Program ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 44 = 76 = 97 = 118 = 139 = 162 | Rocard / Buzek 5  | + | (bb) a "computer" is a realisation of an abstract machine, consisting of entities such as processing units, storage space and interfaces for information exchange with external systems and human users. "Data processing" is calculation with abstract component entities of computers. A "computer program" is a data-processing solution which, once it has been correctly described, can be executed by computer. |

Accordingly to this definition, a brake locking system or a computer tomography solution is not within the range of "data processing".  The main effect of the definitions is to limit the scope of what can be excluded from patentability by calling it "data processing".

== Article 2 (b)c (new) ==

=== Definition of Interoperability ===

| number | submitter | recommendation | text |
| 19 | JURI 19 | + | "Interoperability" means the ability of a computer program to communicate and exchange information with other computer programs and mutually to use the information which has been exchanged, including the ability to use, convert or exchange file formats, protocols, schemas, interface information or conventions, so as to permit such a computer program to work with other computer programs and with users in all the ways in which they are intended to interact. |
