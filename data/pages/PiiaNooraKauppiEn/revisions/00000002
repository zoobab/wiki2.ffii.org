''Piia-Noora Kauppi, finnish conservative MEP, is the shadow rapporteur of the European People's Party (EPP) for the 2nd reading of the software patent directive.  During the 1st reading of 2002-3, this post was held by Joachim Wuermeling from the Bavarian Christian Social Union.  While Wuermeling acted as a spearhead of the patent lobby, Kauppi led a group of dissidents within EPP who made the clear position of September 2003 possible.  As a shadow rapporteur, Kauppi is under great pressure to integrate the two groups within the party.  She has basically retabled her proposals of 2003, but with certain reductions and pollutions which may be needed to accomodate the Wuermeling wing.''
