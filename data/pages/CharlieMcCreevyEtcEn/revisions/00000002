== McCreevy willing to veto EU taxes, calls anti-EU referendum result a "healthy development"  ==

http://www.kc3.co.uk/~dt/Ireland.htm

  Here is a long article from the time of the Nice Treaty that
  indicates that McCreevy is willing to stand up when it comes
  to EU Constitution language for vetoing taxes, but there's all
  sorts of shady behavior alluded to here.  Only a brief mention
  of SW patents unrelated to McCreevy per se.  But here are a
  couple of discouraging paragraphs, given the present political
  juncture regarding the SW Patent Directive:

  The Nice treaty on EU enlargement held up by Irish opposition
  is a flawed plan on course for a second defeat by Irish voters,
  Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the head of a new Convention on the
  bloc's future, said on Thursday. Veteran former French
  President Giscard d'Estaing told France Inter radio the treaty
  aimed at widening the bloc to include 12 new members, most
  from eastern Europe, was a failure. "The Nice treaty satisfied
  no one, and what's more, at the time, it could not be ratified
  because one of the countries refused to ratify it - Ireland,"
  he said, referring to the referendum held in Ireland last
  June. "They will vote again but you know that current polls
  show another "no" and if they (the Irish) say no, there is no
  Nice treaty, as it must be ratified unanimously," he added.
  Ireland's veto of the treaty rocked the 15-nation bloc to the
  core and reminded its sometimes remote leaders that the public
  must be kept on board. Irish premier Bertie Ahern has said it
  is essential his people ratify the treaty and hopes to win a
  second referendum on Nice, despite the pessimistic signs, some
  time next year. (Reuters 21 Dec 2001)

  [...]

  EU foreign ministers issued a statement saying in effect that
  they would ignore the result of the Irish referendum. In a
  common communique they said, "While respecting the will of
  the Irish people, the foreign ministers expressed their
  regrets at the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Nice
  treaty. They rule out any re-opening of the text signed at
  Nice. The process of ratification will be continued on the
  basis of this text and in accordance with the planned
  timetable. The other fourteen states have said they are ready
  to help the Irish government in all possible ways to find a
  way out by taking into account the worries which the results
  of the referendum reflect, without re-opening the text of the
  Nice treaty." By this statement, European leaders formally
  gave notice that they have abolished democracy. It is a
  long-established fundamental principle of democracies that
  governments are responsible to the people who elected them
  and to their representatives. By stating that the
  ratification process is a rubber stamp which can be overruled
  at will, the governments of Europe have explicitly stated
  that they do not recognise the rights of their national
  legislatures (for instance to ratify treaties, or to change
  the constitutional structures which govern their countries)
  and that instead they, the governments, enjoy those rights
  instead. This is, quite literally, a coup d'etat. (European

  World News
  from The Progressive Review

  AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD, TELEGRAPH, LONDON: Ireland's
  Attorney General, Michael McDowell, has accused officials in
  Brussels of arrogantly trying to force Europe's diverse
  nations into a super-state no one wants. Mr McDowell told
  the Institute of European Affairs in Dublin that Irish voters
  rejected the European Union's Nice Treaty partly because of a
  "widespread perception that developments in Europe were
  taking a turn, or moving in a direction, that caused deep
  unease." He said "a narrow class of activist office-holders,
  elected and unelected," were charging ahead of public opinion
  ... His speech on Monday was a further warning to Brussels
  that it will not be easy to make the Irish change their minds
  in a second referendum. During the weekend's summit at
  Gothenburg, EU leaders refused to contemplate altering any
  text in the treaty, although it is technically null and void
  for all 15 states if any country refuses to ratify it. The
  Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, was told it was his
  responsibility to resolve the constitutional impasse, despite
  several leaders admitting privately that they would have had
  difficulties if the treaty had been put to a popular test in
  their own countries.  Mr McDowell is the fourth Irish cabinet
  member to break ranks. The finance minister, Charlie
  McCreevy, caused astonishment in Gothenburg by describing
  Ireland's rejection of the treaty as a "healthy development".

  BRIAN LAVERY, NY TIMES: In a serious political embarrassment
  for the Irish government, figures released today showed that
  voters had forcefully rejected a treaty that would expand
  membership of the European Union ... With the referendum,
  the Irish government hoped to be one of the first countries
  to ratify the so-called Treaty of Nice, which was negotiated
  over four days last December. Of the 15 European Union
  members, only Ireland requires a nationwide vote to approve
  such treaties. Under the treaty former Communist countries
  like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic would be
  admitted to the union. The group's structures would also be
  reformed in line with the expansion plans. Rejection of the
  treaty will not mean any immediate difficulties for the 12
  countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, who are currently
  applying for membership. Their applications are in the early
  stages and there is plenty of time to renegotiate the treaty
  before the final stage of the application process. MORE

  FOLLOW-UP TO THE LISBON EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND
  PREPARATION FOR THE NICE EUROPEAN COUNCIL

  COUNCIL CONCLUSIONS

  The importance of significantly improving the flow of
  funding for innovative enterprises and new entrepreneurs
  to foster employment was highlighted in the conclusions of
  the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000, which
  asked "the Council and the Commission to report by the end
  of 2000 on the ongoing review of EIB and EIF financial
  instruments in order to redirect funding towards support
  for business start-ups, high-tech firms and micro-
  enterprises, as well as other risk-capital initiatives
  proposed by the EIB".

  The Council welcomes the Commission's communication on
  review of Community financial instruments for enterprises,
  including the steps envisaged to improve coordination, and
  supports the need to adapt the Community financial
  instruments in line with the new knowledge based economy.

  The Council estimates that there is a need to stimulate
  the new knowledge based economy and the entrepreneurial
  spirit in the European Union by facilitating the creation
  of innovative companies and taking full advantage of R&D
  effort. In particular, the Council notes that there still
  remains a noticeable financing gap for very early stage
  technology-based companies. Therefore the Council considers
  that, within the present budgetary framework, Community
  instruments should be refocused on earlier phases in the
  innovation cycle, addressing identifiable market failures.

  STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: AN INSTRUMENT FOR
  STRUCTURAL REFORMS --- DRAFT COUNCIL REPORT TO THE NICE
  EUROPEAN COUNCIL

  The Council discussed a draft report prepared by the
  Economic Policy Committee on structural performance
  indicators. This report had been requested by the Lisbon
  European Council and it took account of a Commission
  communication on the same subject. The purpose of these
  indicators is to be able to assess progress made in
  economic and social reforms more objectively in the four
  priority areas developed in Lisbon, namely employment,
  innovation, economic reform and social cohesion. The
  report also contains general indicators on the economic
  context.

  As suggested by the Commission, the Council agreed on a
  global list of indicators which were common to the
  Council and the Commission. This list did not pre-empt
  the, no doubt shorter, list of indicators which would be
  taken to illustrate the Commission's synthesis report to
  the Stockholm European Council.

  At the close of the discussions the Council decided to
  submit the report to the Nice European Council together
  with a note from the Presidency summarising the comments
  made by the delegations on the number and the type of
  indicators.

  These structural indicators are listed in Annex.

  Charlie McCreevy's appointment is a move away from a
  Social Europe in the direction of a Supermarket Europe

  Speaking in the European Parliament today Proinsias De
  Rossa MEP condemned Charlie McCreevy's nomination as a
  European Commissioner, describing him as one of the most
  right wing Ministers for Finance in Europe. He reminded
  the Parliament that he was one of the Ministers for
  Finance who sought to remove the Parliament's democratic
  control over the Union's budget. 

  "In Ireland McCreevy has presided over the worst housing
  crisis, health crisis and growing inequality for a
  generation, at a time of massive wealth creation. He is a
  right winger who believes in incentives - tax breaks and
  hand outs for the wealthy and a kick in 'arse' for the
  poor. 

  Mr De Rossa, while listing some of the Irish Presidency's
  more glaring social policy failures, as well as those on
  Iraq and debt cancellation, praised the Taoiseach and his
  team in successfully concluding the historic negotiations
  on the European Constitution. 

  "Their success was in retaining the broad framework,
  values, objectives and citizens rights which the European
  Convention had drafted. By doing so I believe the
  legitimacy of the European integration process has been
  enhanced while the foundation for a more democratic and
  inclusive Europe has been laid.

== "Ireland is now a knowledge economy" ==

-> IeIda04En

(This is stuff from Sean Dorgan, who I think reports to McCreevy)

  Ireland is now a knowledge economy

  "Ireland can now convincingly claim to be a knowledge economy,"
  said Sean Dorgan, Chief Executive of IDA Ireland in the
  Agency's review of 2003. "Developments during 2003 in the
  inward investment arena reinforced the transformation which has
  been underway in key competitive features of the economy making
  it attractive for a new breed of high level projects based on
  knowledge and the way we use it." 

  "Such high level projects secured in 2003 were Google, Overture
  and eBay/PayPal --- each of which is establishing a key European
  Centre in Dublin; ABB's new global R&D and marketing Centre in
  Dundalk, and Ingersoll Rand's new global export sales and
  service operation in Co. Dublin. 

  Ireland's transformation to a 'knowledge economy' is currently
  being conveyed to the international marketplace by IDA through
  a new marketing message --- "Ireland, knowledge is in our
  nature""," said Mr. Dorgan 

  Mr. Dorgan continued "In Research and Development there were 39
  new investments, totalling over Sô¥ñ00 million, approved for IDA-
  supported companies. And a total of 64 inward investment
  projects (33 greenfield and 31 expansions) were supported
  during the year." 

  "These R&D investments included Olympus Diagnostica's addition
  of a fully integrated research and knowledge base in Co. Clare;
  Intel's new Innovation Centre for R&D in leading-edge IT
  technology in Co. Kildare; and three separate R&D investments,
  totalling Sô¥ó4 million, by GlaxoSmithKline in Cork," he added.

  "The manufacturing investments for which we are competing now
  require a high proportion of third level graduates (e.g. Abbott
  Laboratories' new Longford and Sligo operations will require
  80% of the 950 employees to have a third level qualification)
  and people with advanced skills (e.g. SAP's new global
  technical support centre in Galway and WyethMedica's recruit-
  ment of 800 people in Dublin for its high skilled
  biopharmaceutical facility, the largest in the world)," he
  said.

  The quality of the activities now being attracted to Ireland is
  also reflected by the fact that almost 40% of the new jobs in
  IDA-supported projects secured in 2003 will pay salaries in
  excess of Sô¥ó7,000. In addition, overseas companies in Ireland
  now spend Sô¥ñ4.7 billion in the Irish economy from their annual
  sales of Sô¥ö9.3 billion and exports of Sô¥ö5.2 billion. 

  "Looking to 2004, we believe that the coming year will be our
  best since 2000 in terms of new investments into Ireland and of
  growth in the value and scale of activities in overseas
  companies here. We are now competing for some very significant
  investments of high value and considerable skill content,"
  concluded Mr. Dorgan.

=== "Ireland, knowledge is in our nature" ===

  Ireland, knowledge is in our nature" - the new Ireland brand
  message highlighting Ireland's transformation to a 'knowledge
  economy' is currently being conveyed to the international
  marketplace by IDA. 

  Sean Dorgan, Chief Executive of IDA Ireland,says "It is
  designed to tell the story and highlight the characteristics
  that define Ireland and its people. The innate creative
  imagination of Irish people has long existed and has been an
  impetus for sparkling accomplishments in recent years. Ireland
  provides the right environment to bring knowledge-based
  businesses to peak performance. This has been proven time and
  again by leading global companies here. The ability to use
  knowledge quickly, flexibly and creatively is a
  distinguishing feature of Ireland for these companies."

  "Our success in coming years will be fundamentally dependent
  on our ability to achieve an environment where research and
  knowledge, high level skills and expertise, high quality
  infrastructure and business services, are combined in that
  flexible and creative way which is almost uniquely Irish. Our
  new marketing message will show to international investors
  that we already have many of these essential features."

  Thenew brand message has been endorsed by international
  business leaders such as Michael Dell of Dell, "At the heart
  of the Irish and Dell character are big dreams, a passion for
  building and re-building and the tenacity to adapt to
  challenging circumstances." And Jim O'Hara of Intel Ireland,
  "Our employees have consistently proven their ability to
  master the disciplines involved in the world's most advanced
  technologies." 

  "The visual interpretation of the theme combines the computer
  image of a human DNA sequence, DNA being what makes each of
  us unique just as the characteristics that define Ireland are
  also unique, with the human hand print, to emphasise the
  essential human aspects of knowledge  imagination,
  creativity, skills, ideas and culture. This visual balance
  between humanity and technology represents the essential
  harmony required to build a sustainable knowledge-based
  economy and society," said Mr. Dorgan.

== 1999: Climbing the Value Lader ==

-> IeTransform99En

http://www.worldeyereports.com/Reports/ireland/

  Climbing the value ladder
  Thursday, March 11, 1999

  Ireland has been transformed from a predominantly agrarian
  postcolonial society into a vibrant economic force that has
  consistently topped the OECD countries in terms of economic
  growth over each of the past five years. "In a decade, we
  have turned the economy around from bankruptcy to what is
  now called the Celtic Tiger," stated the minister for
  finance, Charlie, McCreevy, as he summarized the state of
  affairs. 

  Unlike most European countries, Ireland has no industrial
  revolution skeletons in its closet to weigh down the economy.
  The people left the potato fields andstepped directly into
  cutting-edge research centers and laboratories. This country
  of tradition is burgeoning with new influences generated by
  its inclusion into the European Union in 1973.

  "Joining the European Community was a very significant
  decision," explained Sean Dorgan, chief executive officer of
  the Industrial Development Agency (IDA). "Not only in terms
  of market accessibility or fiscal transfers but restating
  Ireland's position in the global community and within Europe
  in particular."

  Ireland's remarkable economic performance has been
  unprecedented since the foundation of the republic and has
  increased opportunities and options for everyone.
  Unemployment is at all-time low and employers actually feel
  it is a challenge to find sufficient employees. The living
  standard is rising, salaries are increasing and property
  prices are skyrocketing. With a youthful population in
  prosperity, the country is finding itself in an atmosphere
  of confidence and optimism.

  The country's recent success is a result of a number of
  factors. Being one of the most profitable destination in
  Europe for overseas companies to establish themselves,
  Ireland has thrived on direct foreign investment. It is
  attractive due to its competitive cost structure, low
  taxation, flexible and skilled labor force. The corporate
  tax rate of 12.5 percent, remains the lowest in Europe.
  Ireland also boasts an inflation rate of less than 3
  percent since 1992. 

  The government encourages entrepreneurial activity and aims
  to stimulate the economy further through their policy of
  privatization. The recent flotation of the state
  telecommunications company proved a well-managed boost to
  the economy. Several banks are being considered for sale and
  the government is discussing the privatization of state-
  owned airports, airlines and ports. Dublin's stock exchange
  has been one of the world's best performing markets over the
  past two years.

< SNIP >

  Initially, investment inflows were focused at the basic
  assembly level in the internationally buoyant sectors.
  Investment in the computer industry followed suit as
  multinational blue-chip enterprises established production
  and research facilities, eventually making Ireland the
  second-largest exporter of software in the world.
  Pharmaceutical and health-care companies also began to
  invest in Ireland.

  The field of financial services has also shown rapid growth
  in Ireland, especially since the establishment of the
  International Financial Services Center (IFSC). "Over time,
  the level of activity, the volume of activity and the
  quality of activity has continually increased. Now we are
  very significant players in European terms in foreign direct
  investment. We have significant market share in terms of
  manufacturing and financial services," explained Dorgan.

  Various indigenous companies are also on the rise as they
  ride the waves of demand in the successful economy. Some
  companies rise to be key players in their market, others
  profit from patents. 

  For many years, the key measure of IDA performance was the
  number of new jobs that they managed to generate from their
  investments. Now, instead of bringing in large companies to
  provide employment, the IDA must meet the challenges that
  accompany economic maturity and build on Ireland's
  achievements.

  With its economic framework in place, Ireland is ready to
  take the next step and work toward improving its resilience
  and adaptability to the ever-changing demands of the world
  market. Economic analysts believe that Ireland can sustain
  future prosperity as long as the foundations are firm
  enough to withstand the precarious course of fluctuating
  global economic conditions.  

  With regional development a priority, Ireland is focusing
  on bringing investment into areas other than Dublin and its
  surroundings to enable the entire country to benefit from
  the quickly rising economy. Attention is being placed on
  the cities Limerick, Cork and Galway, and there is a drive
  to spread prosperity to the segment of the population that
  is not directly benefiting from the economic boom.

  However, most agree that Ireland needs to address its
  deficit in infrastructure. An essential point of
  concentration for the future of Ireland lies in the
  development of a modern infrastructure in terms of quality
  roads, airports and ports. The plan proposed by the
  Department of Finance will involve spending 33.4 billion
  punts over the next seven years to develop the country's
  roads, railways, human resources, housing and sewer
  systems. This is an essential factor in the sustainability
  of Ireland's economic resurgence.

  "For years upon years, we were grappling with the problems
  of failure. Now, we have to deal with the problems of
  success," stated McCreevy as he summarized Ireland's
  condition. "We must focus on how we will go through our
  next phase of development."

  The Irish are aware that the Celtic Tiger image is a
  vulnerable one, and thus move very cautiously with careful
  planning. Investments are made for the long term. They
  remain supremely confident and given the economic
  forecasts, have every reason to be.

  McCreevy calm on Commission challenge
  January 14, 2004

  Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy has said the EU
  Commission's decision to mount a challenge to a decision
  taken by EU finance ministers in November may be a good
  thing.

  The Commission said yesterday it would challenge in the
  European Court of Justice the ministers' decision not to
  impose sanctions on France and Germany over their
  budgetary policy. 

  The sanctions procedures had been recommended by the
  European Commission but opposed by a majority of ministers
  including Charlie McCreevy.

  Mr McCreevy told RTE radio the challenge may provide legal
  certainty for the future, but he also warned that it could
  throw Commission powers in many other areas into doubt.

  He said the move may also make it easier to change the EU
  Stability & Growth Pact, which underpins the euro and sets
  strict rules for member states' budget deficits. The
  Minister would like to see the rules changed to take more
  account of issues such as the size of the country, levels
  of debt and the state of the public finances.
