''Berlin, 17 February 2005 -- The German Bundestag unanimously passed a motion which strongly attacks the Council version of the European software patents directive. As such, the German Bundestag joins growing the club of national Parliaments which have spoken out against software patents. These actions make the Council's attempts to continue trying to push it through look more desperate and unworldly by the day.''

The [[http:Cons040518En|Council of Ministers version]] was generally considered to be completely inappropriate:
"I think that here in the German Bundestag we were able to quickly reach an
agreement about the fact that the state of the discussion at the EU level leaves many
central questions open", stated MP Dirk Manzewski (SPD). MP Rainer Funke (FDP)
elaborated: "The necessary and meaningful unification of patenting practice
should not be allowed to lead to an extension of substantive patent law."

MP Dr. Günter Krings (CDU/CSU) emphasized that a directive "that is worth
its name", needs a concrete definition of technicality and must exclude
program claims. He was happy to be in time with the 
Bundestag resolution:

"When we dealt with this issue in the Bundestag 
about four months ago, probably nobody expected that the EU Council of 
Ministers would not yet have passed the Political Agreement negotiated
in May. It is rare for the passing of a resolution draft
to be postponed this often. The directive draft has become a buck that EU Council
presidencies pass to their successors. After the Dutch government found
that nut too hard to crack, it is now up to the Luxemburgers."

In addition to the Dutch Tweede Kamer, the Spanish Senado and
the Bundestag votes, he also praised the European Parliament:

"Our MEP colleagues have now also opted for a restart of the
legislative process in the European Parliament and to search for a
constructive solution. The German government should take this
motion at heart, as it is notably also supported by the representatives
of the EPP. Now it's time for the Minister of Justice base its negotiations
in Brussels on the interest of software developers and their employees.
We are waiting for deeds."

Manzewski ("if even I as SPD legal specialist  had to swallow when reading
some of the formulations ...") and Krings thanked the employees of all
groups for their help during the negotiation process, namely 
Mr Nermin Fazlic and Mrs Petra Marmann (SPD),
Mr Oliver Passek and Mrs Franziska Vilmar (Greens), Mr
Ole Jani (FDP) and Mr Jörn Henkel (CDU). It is thanks to their
cooperation, "that Germany speaks with one voice in Brussels"
(MP Jerzy Montag, Greens).

MP Jörg Tauss (SPD) said: "Incidentally, this refutes an old
prejudice that computer scientists generally are apolitical 
or technocratic. They are not at all 'specialists without
spirit' in the way Max Weber had predicted for the outcome 
of the societal rationalisation process. They are highly
qualified, discerning and committed often young persons standing 
up for their convictions and taking part in political processes."

"The present motion especially intends to partially correct a 
deficit of the Brussels conciliations. The central concern for me 
is the obstinate ignorance that Brussels has shown to 
the real European and German economical interests in the 
software field. It is the !SMEs that are the vectors of innovation
in Germany's and Europe's IT field", he added.

Holger Blasum (FFII) comments: "Past Tuesday, entrepreneurs
and software developers were looking for signals from the Ministry
of Justice when demonstrating at its Berlin Mohrenstraße site. The restart option
submitted by the Conference of Presidents yesterday opens new 
doors. All groups in the Bundestag deserve praise for their
clear position. In so far the government is concerned, I now follow 
Dr. Krings: 'We are waiting for deeds.' The possibilities
to act are plentiful now."
