''arebenti proposal: install Drupal as a low level supporter blogging infrastructure.''

 * http://www.drupal.org/
 * This was a pre-vote proposal to distract supporters noise from our mailing lists to a more open environment where they can talk and discuss about their personal lobbying experiences.  It is of lower priority now.
