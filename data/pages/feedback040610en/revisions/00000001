 $OPENING,

 The Elections to the European Parliament have begun.

 As you know, the European Parliament can save us from the software
 patent directive and other harmful legislation proposals.  You may
 want to take the information on

  	 http://kwiki.ffii.org/ElectAct0405En

 into account when voting.  The page lists some more things you can do,
 including participation in the

 	 European Parliament Election Web Demo
 	 http://kwiki.ffii.org/ElectWebdemo0406En

 There is also another 

 	 Urgent Appeal
 	 http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/

 to sign and distribute.  This appeal can help us to prevent the recent
 Council Decision from being enacted.

 To help us coordinate the actions, please '''reply''' to this mail
 (forwarding won't work) and fill in ('+' for 'yes', '-' for 'no' or
 text as requested):

  [] I am a supporter of the FFII and therefore
     welcome occasional mailings such as this one.
  [] I will participate in the Webdemo this weekend
     and temporarily cover my web page [http://__]
  [] I sign the Urgent Appeal.
  [] I agree to be listed publicly as a signatory.
 
 Thank you for your understanding and support.

 Yours Sincerely,

 the FFII Board
