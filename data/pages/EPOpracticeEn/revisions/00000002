 "Advice to the State Secretary of Economic Affairs on the stance to be 
 adopted by the Netherlands in the second reading on the Directive on 
 the Patentability of Computer-implemented Inventions. (...)

 It has become clear to the Advisory Committee during its consultations 
 that the major problems in current practice are:

 - The fact that too many patents are granted on software inventions that, 
 in the view of those in practice, make no or only a very limited contribution 
 to the state of the art. The fact that many patents granted are not actually 
 for new inventions, but that those assessing the patents lack sufficient 
 knowledge of the 'prior art' in order to determine this. 

 - The fact that patents on software and/or computer programmes do not properly 
 meet the requirement under patent law of the scope for further development of the
 disclosure, as a result of which the contribution to the state of the art remains 
 hidden, even to an expert, and compromises the principle of 'quid pro quo'
 that underlies patent law. 

 - The fact that patents are nevertheless granted on business methods."
