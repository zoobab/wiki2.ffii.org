 * Loss for Partito Radicale / Lista Bonino: Only 2 of 6 !MEPs from this very helpful group come back.  Would like to know whether Marco Cappato is among them.    
 * Alleanza Nazionale (UEN), which voted 100% with ffii recommendations and gave us active help especially through MEP Muscardini, seem to have won 1 more MEP.
 * Uniti nell'Ulivo, the first party, is a collection of different parties and it is very difficult to know who of the MEPs elected will be considered friend or foe.  We have to wait for the final names elected and compare that to the declarations of interest we received before the elections.
