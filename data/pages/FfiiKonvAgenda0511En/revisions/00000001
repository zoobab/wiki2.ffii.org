## Comment from bkaindl on 2005-11-23, 15:28 MET, DO NOT EDIT this comment!
## From http://lists.ffii.org/pipermail/board-minutes/2005-November/000001.html:
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The following 4 items were proposed to the board by Hartmut Pilch and approved
## with the votes of Jan Macek, Alex Macfie, Jonas Maebe, Hartmut Pilch and
## Gerald Sedrati-Dinet on 2005-11-29:
## ...
##  3. The board will finallise the agenda for the General Assembly by tuesday
##  November 22nd 15.00.  In particular questions open to voting, each with a 
##  finite set of selectable answers, must be fixed before this deadline.
## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## .
## This means that the agenda was fixed in particular to
## questions open to voting, by November 22nd 15:00
## .
## This means: No more edits to the agenda, in particular not to questions open to voting!
## .
## As a result, I reverted an anonymous change to this page, which happened at 2005-11-28,
## 18:00:35 GMT, after the deadline given the the board, which affected voting, and therefore
## had to be reverted to reflect this board decision. I also write-protected the page to
## prevent changes without login, to allow for easyer tracking of changes, especially as
## this is an important page containing the agenda of the general assembly.

## Comment by bkaindl on 2005-11-23 18:11 MET:
## Also restored the agenda points for the end of the meeting from version 1.27 which was
## the last one before the 15:00 deadline. Reason: one line which was agreed after long discussion in the monday IRC meeting was removed: 
## 0 Feedback from Members. Some discussion of FFIIs goals and scope.

## Comment by gibuskro on 2005-11-24 16:43 CET:
## items "GLU's amendment" and "Feedback from Members. Some discussion of FFII's goals and scope." are redondant
## Also the 'open treasurer' wording is redundant with separate election of treasurer
## (remark: if people do not vote Jochen in, we can deal with that at the assembly.If that happens, then i would say the 'vote the bums out' ticket has momentum, too.)
