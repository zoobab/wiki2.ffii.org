Describe the new page here.
The agenda for it does not mention IPR anywhere and its about "eInclusion", it seems to be not as industry-driven as other EU topics, since seems to be defined like this:
bkaindl eInclusion aims to prevent risks of 'digital exclusion', that is to ensure that disadvantaged people are not left behind and to avoid new forms of exclusion due to lack of digital literacy or of Internet access.
bkaindl At the same time eInclusion means also tapping new 'digital opportunities' for the inclusion of socially disadvantaged people and less-favoured areas.
bkaindl However maybe there is a hook with LinEx in Extremadura and the threats from patents to Linux
