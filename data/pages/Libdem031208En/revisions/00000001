At its recent conference, the youth wing of the UK Liberal Democrats
has passed a 
[http://www.hhlibdems.org.uk/ldys/policy/article/softwarepatents.php resolution]
which criticizes the Libdem members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
for voting in favour of software patents.  The UK Libdems in the
European Parliament, led by Diana Wallis and Andrew Duff, had voted
against the party's previous policy papers and against their own
public statements.  Instead they had followed the recommendations of
Arlene McCarthy (MEP, UK Labour) and the UK Patent Office.   The
Libdem Youth explains why it is important that this course be
corrected before the second reading in the European Parliament.  

FFII UK has a documentation about the
[http://www.ffii.org.uk/libdems.html Liberal Democrats] and about
the [http://www.ffii.org.uk/uk_meps.html UK !MEPs] in general.

The voting behaviour of the Libdem MEPs can also be studied in our
