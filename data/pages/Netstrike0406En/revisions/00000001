--> [:FfiiprojPriorEn: Priorities]
----

== What is this  ==

 * as announced in http://aktiv.ffii.org/?l=en&f=netstrike and elsewhere
 * packaging/naming somewhat different from previous "netstrikes", rely more on banners

== To do ==

 * find project leader
 * create short strike pages 
   * one appetite-whetting message
   * on importance of Europarl for EU democracy, rather than just on swpat
 * create election banners
   * possibly with logos of good parties
 * improve [:Elect0405En: election pages]
   * provide a usable instruction (e.g. "in case of doubt green") to the impatient
   * ask national helpdesks to create proper national pages
