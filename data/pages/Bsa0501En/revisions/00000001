In a new paper, the Business Software Alliance (BSA), a copyright enforcement initiative financed mainly by Microsoft, raises concerns about "spiraling litigation costs over patenting rights" which "threaten to stifle innovation".  BSA is particularly concerned about small patent licensing companies that specialise on attacking large companies.

 * BSA recommends only minor reforms of the US patent system.  In principle, BSA wants software to be patentable in the US, in Europe and everywhere.
 * The paper is part of a "CEO Initiative", with other documents to follow.

"The BSA also proposed changes to U.S. patent law. The technology
industry is facing spiraling litigation costs over patent rights,
which the BSA said threatens to stifle innovation.

One problem is that as patents have proliferated, a new kind of
business has emerged in which companies seek to enforce patents solely
to make money, not to use the technology. Even when the patents are
not likely to stand up in court, companies often settle with the
patent owners rather than go through costly legal battles."
