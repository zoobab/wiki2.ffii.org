Extracts from the Indian Patent Office's [[http://www.patentoffice.nic.in/ipr/patent/manual.htm|Manual of Patent Practice and Procedure]], July 2001.

Note: this text relates to the Indian Patents Act before the Patents (Amendment) Act of 2002, which 
created an explicit exclusion (Art 3(k)) that a "/computer program per se/" should not be
considered an invention. Under the new Patents (Amendment) Ordinance 2004, that clause 
would be modified to exclude only "/a computer program per se other than its technical application to industry or a combination with hardware/" would be excluded. The limits of what exactly would or would not be patentable under the new wording are not yet fully clear. ([[Nath0412En| wiki discussion]]).

1.3.8 Computer Programs

1. Computer program is not patentable invention as computer program is
a set of instructions for controlling a sequence of operations of a dataprocessing
system. It closely resembles a mathematical method. It
may be expressed in various forms eg. A series of verbal statements, a
flow chart, an algorithm, or other coded form and may be presented in
a format suitable for direct entry into a particular computer, or may
require transcription into a different format (or computer language). It
may merely be written on paper or recorded on some machine readable 
medium such as magnetic tape or disc or optically scanned
record, or it may be permanently recorded in a control store forming
part of a computer. Thus it is evident that a program may be presented
in terms of either software or firmware.

2. Since the claims may be couched in terms which tend to obscure the
fact that the invention relates to a computer program, it is always
essential to analyse them, in the light of what is described and of the
prior art, in order to identify the contribution to the art and hence
determine whether this advance resides in, or necessarily includes,
technological features, or is solely intellectual in its content. For
example, if the new feature comprises a set of instructions (program),
which may be formulated and presented in any one of a variety of
ways, designed to control a known computer to cause it to perform
desired operations, the computer being suitable for the purpose
without special adoption or modification of its hardware or organization
then, no matter whether claimed as a computer arranged to operate
etc or as a method of operating a computer etc .Such a subject
matter is not Patentable and hence excluded from patentability . The
invention here relates solely to the novel program. The claim might eg
stipulate that the instructions were encoded in a particular way on a
particular known medium but this would not affect the issue. If however
the format of the program, or the nature of the record medium (tape,
disc etc.) necessitated some non-standard adaptation to the computer
itself (this factor being integral to the invention and not an arbitrary
unrelated addition) then the exclusion would not apply. Likewise an
invention which related to a particular manner of organizing the overall
operation of the Central Processing Unit and the peripheral units,
regardless of whether the invention were implemented by means of a
program or special hardware facilities, would not be excluded.

3. If the implementation of a new program requires internal modification
to a computer of such a nature that it may reasonably be regarded as a
new computer then clearly a claim to this computer is not excluded,
even though at first sight the invention may seem to relate merely to a
program and the purpose of modifying the computer is subsidiary to
this. The modification must however be inventive itself; if a computer is
modified in a manner which is the obvious way of implementing the
program, then the inventive contribution will still reside solely in the
program itself.

4. As a general rule a novel solution to a problem relating to the internal
operations of a computer, although it may comprise a program or subroutine,
will also necessarily involve technological features of the
computer hardware or the manner in which it operates and thus, if
appropriately claimed, may be patentable.

5. A hardware implementation performing a novel function is excluded
only if that particular hardware system is known or is obvious
irrespective of the function performed.

6. An invention consists of hardware along with software or computer
program in order to perform the function of the hardware, such
invention may be considered Patentable.
