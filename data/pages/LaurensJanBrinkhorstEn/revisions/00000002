 * 2004-08-02 [[NlParl040802En| Brinkhorst reinterprets Parliament's vote, continues push for software patents]]

== Background ==

Mr. Brinkhorst is currently the dutch minister of Economic Affairs. He is affiliated with the party D'66 (Social Liberals). At the time of this writing (2004-5-14) the main attention needs to be focused on him, since he is the one who will be voting in the Council of Ministers on behalf of the Netherlands on 2004-5-17. 

In a letter he wrote to the dutch parliament on 2004-5-10, he declared that he would be voting '''in favor''' of software patents. This is not only a disappointment, but also somewhat of a surprise, because his party D'66 is generally '''opposed''' to software patents. The minister's decision is based on input from his advisors in the ministery. Hopefully, fellow party members will manage to persuade him to reconsider his decision before the final vote.
