''Monday, 7 March 2005 -- In a comment to the media, Ian Hudghton, MEP of the Scottish National Party (SNP) criticises the decision of the Council of Ministers to "adopt" a "common position" on software patents without a qualified majority.  Hudghton does not seem to be aware of the illegality of the adoption itself yet.''

EU MINISTERS' BLOW TO SMALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

SNP European Spokesman '''Ian Hudghton MEP''' has criticised European Economics Ministers who today backed controversial new rules on software patents that many fear could have a severely detrimental effect on independent software developers.

There are concern s that the new rules will favour large multinational companies such as Microsoft who have the financial means to exploit the new regime. At present, computer software is subject to copyright legislation in Europe but the new plans would make software patentable.

Speaking from Strasbourg, Ian Hudghton MEP said:

"I've been contacted by a number of constituents who are very concerned about these proposals. I share their concerns and we've been demanding changes to the new rules before they come into force. Today's decision by European ministers is disappointing but at least it means the plans will come back before the European Parliament where they'll face strong opposition.

It's appalling that Ministers chose to favour big multinational companies over small scale businesses who will find it even more difficult to compete if the market is skewed further in favour of the likes of Microsoft. We should be encouraging and supporting the development of high tech creative industries not working against them. These are ill thought out plans that need radical overhaul."
