== Synposis ==

Linspire Inc was formerly called Lindows.

However, under pressure of lawsuits and in return for a sum of 20 mn USD from Microsoft, they ceded the "Lindows" trademark and changed their name to "Linspire".

Linspire continues to be active at the forefront of competition with Microsoft's business: in the desktop computing market.  They therefore also expect to be at the forefront of further legal pressure from Microsoft, this time based mainly on patents.
