A Directiva de Patentes de Software foi removida da Agenda do Conselho da Agricultura. O Secretário de Estado polaco do Ministério da Tecnologia e Sociedade da Informação, Wlodzimierz Marcinski, solicitou firmemente a sua remoção no início da reunião. O Comissário da Agricultura expressou o seu pesar, mas o item-A foi apagado e não será adoptado este ano.

== O que se passou ==

A reunião foi presidida pelo ministro Holandês da aricultura, Cees Veerman. Poucos esperavam a presença do Secretário de Estado polaco do Ministério da Tecnologia e Sociedade da Informação, Wlodzimierz Marcinski. Veio pessoalmente a Bruxelas para apresentar o ponto de vista da Polónia, porque os diplomatas polacos na UE estavam sob grande pressão da presidência holandesa. Os representantes polacos negaram várias vezes nos últimos meses que a Polónia se opunha ao texto, apesar da oposição do ministério em Varsóvia.

== James Heald (FFII UK Press Release) ==

Tuesday 21 December -- FFII welcomes the courageous decision of Poland to remove the 
A-item adopting the Directive' COM 2002/0047 (COD) "On the Patentability of
Computer-Implemented Inventions" (Software Patent Directive) from the agenda of
todays meeting. 

The fact that the unilateral declarations of concerns by member states
contained more text than the actual directive itself, only accentuated the
proposed text's woeful lack of support and lack of democratic legitimacy.

National governments were mislead into believing they were getting a Directive
which allowed patents only for computer-controlled technical devices. Instead,
most patent professionals believe the proposed text would have forced Member
States to uphold the furthest reaches of current EPO practice -- so that, in
[http://elj.warwick.ac.uk/jilt/03-1/davies.htm the words of patent attorney Simon Davies], "all inventions that might
reasonably be considered as within the realm of computer science, for example
procedures at the operating system level to improve machine operation, or
generic algorithms, techniques and functionality at the application level"
would be patentable.

Even the UK Government, one of the strongest supporters of the proposed text,
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/14/patent_directive/ admitted that] "Clarity will only come from the first test case in a European
court.

FFII hopes that, inspired by today's developments, the Council of Ministers 
will now go back and thoroughly revise the text, to make it quite clear
what they do and what they do not want to see patented.  This should be
clearly written into the legislation, not left for the courts to decide.

=== Jonas Maebe ===

My prepared quote for this press release was:

  "The political semi-agreement from May evolved into a political obligation to approve a
  disagreement. Brinkhorst did everything he could to save face, only to end up in a situation
  where he is despised more than anyone else in this farce. In the future, maybe it's the US
  that should send observers to the meetings of the EU Council of Ministers, instead of the
  the other way round."

Fortunately, everyone forgot Poland. Today, Poland [http://k.lenz.name/LB/archives/000969.html saved European democracy] and did a tremendous service to the European IT-sector. Thanks to them, the will of the Dutch and German national parliaments can be respected in a future vote. The losers today are not the proponents of software patents. Today, everyone won, except for those who did everything in their power to push through this outdated agreement.

=== André Rebentisch ===

Very good news. It would mean that the Luxembourg presidency will take it over and the Parliaments will get more time.

As Hans Christian Andersen described:
 But among the crowds a little child suddenly gasped out, "But he hasn't got anything on." And the people began to 
 whisper to one another what the child had said. "He hasn't got anything on." "There's a little child saying he hasn't 
 got anything on." Till everyone was saying, "But he hasn't got anything on." The Emperor himself had the uncomfortable 
 feeling that what they were whispering was only too true. "But I will have to go through with the procession," he said 
 to himself.

 So he drew himself up and walked boldly on holding his head higher than before, and the courtiers held on to the train  
 that wasn't there at all.

This was the Council situation after 2004-05-18. They had '''to go through with the procession'''. But now it is time to [:ConsStep0406En: step out of the council deadlock].

== Thanks  ==

The FFII wishes to thank the Polish representatives to the meeting of
the Council for their request to remove the A-item adopting the
Directive' COM 2002/0047 (COD) "On the Patentability of
Computer-Implemented Inventions" (Software Patent Directive) from the
agenda of todays meeting.

By their action, Poland has strengthened the democracy of the European
Union. An attempt to muscle through a bad directive with very
questionable support has been thwarted. We now have a chance to build
a process which results in a directive on Software Patents that has
wide popular support and one which takes into consideration the views
and needs of the new members of the union, as well as the old ones.
