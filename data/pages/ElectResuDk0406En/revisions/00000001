== Seat Distribution ==

Denmark has 14 seats in the parliament. (previously 16)

In the last vote (september) the 5 liberal members voted pro-patent and the one conservative didn't vote (personal reasons).

 * The liberals (pro-softwarepatent) have lost 2 mandates. (from 5 to 3)
 * The "june movement" (against softwarepatents) have lost 2 mandates. (from 3 to 1)
 * The socialdemocrats (not clear - takes a wait-and-see attitude) has gained 2 mandates. (from 3 to 5)
 * Social-liberals keep one MEP. Their MEP voted against swpat in September but new MEP this time.

== Frahm and Hindrup Missing ==

We have lost the two most prominent anti-softwarepatent members ([:PernilleFrahmEn: Pernille Frahm] and [:BentHindrupAndersenEn: Bent Hindrup Andersen]). :(

Pernille Frahm has been replaced by Auken, who is also against softwarepatents, but we do not yet know her commitment to actively work for the case.

Bent Hindrup Andersen simply lost his mandate, which went to the socialdemocrats.

== September 2003 vs Today ==

The result seems to be:

=== 2003-09-24 ===

 * pro-patent: 6 (but one didn't vote)
 * against: 10 (but one didn't vote)

=== 2004-06-13 ===

 * pro-patent: 4 (3 liberals and 1 conservative)
 * don't know: 5  (4 social democrats and 1 socialliberal)
 * against: 5 (the rest)

It seem that much depends on if we're able to enlighten the "don't know" group.

One important result of the election campaign is that there were candidates with a clear anti-softwarepatent stand in all parties - also the pro-patent parties. Although among these, only the social democrat made it into the parliament, the enlightenment process may have helped elsewhere as well.
