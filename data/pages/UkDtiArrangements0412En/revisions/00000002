=== Urgent (7 Dec):  ===
Only a few rooms left for Monday night -- if you want accommodation, you must let us know '''now'''.

== Missing invitations ? ==

According to Lord Sainsbury's [[http://www.infoanarchy.org/wiki/index.php/DTIPatentMeeting|invitation]], "I have decided to invite all the correspondents and their MPs who have written to me".  However, current indications are that about one-third of people who have written to their !MPs did not receive an invitation.

We are urgently trying to find out just who has and who has not been invited.  So please, '''if you have ever contacted your MP''' at Westminster about software patents, '''please fill out and return the questionnaire at the end of this page,''' whether or not you have had a DTI invitation.


== FFII planned events: ==

=== Monday, 13 December ===

7pm - 9pm:   Briefing/workshop on software patents & the DTI meeting at University College, London.

We're in Lecture theatre 212 in the Engineering Building, which is just opposite Waterstone's on Torrington Place:

But if you do want a room, we must have an expression of interest on the questionnaire '''now''', as soon as possible.

== Finally ==

To discuss preparations for the meeting further, please join uk-parl(at)ffii.org by sending email to uk-parl-request(at)ffii.org with subject: Subscribe

There is also a scratch page for questions at [UkDtiQuestions0412En]

If you have not already done so, please send us a copy of any mail you have sent to your MP to us at  uk-parl-sent(at)ffii.org.uk

You might also like to adapt the contents as public testimony for [[http://www.protectinnovation.org/|www.protectinnovation.org]] These make even more impact if you can cite numbers of jobs or real turnover, at risk from software patents.

But please fill in the questionnaire, first thing of all!!


Thank you for your help,
