''July 1st, 2005 -- Today before the start of the summer break the german Bundestag has expectedly expressed mistrust to chancellor Schröder. At the same time the experts for the software patent directive from the german parliamentary groups, namely Rainer Funke (FDP), Dr. Günter Krings (CDU), Jerzy Montag (Grüne/B90), Jörg Tauss (SPD), are addressing their colleagues in the European Parliament with a joint letter in which they express their mistrust against the council version of the software patents directive. This is further understandable as an objection to the activities of the german minister of justice Mrs. Zypries who had written a letter to the european parlamentarians that was contrary the resolution of the Bundestag and contrary the normal procedures.''

== Summary ==

The !MEPs inform about the main idea behind the Bundestag resolution:
 * Protection of software through Copyright, not patent law
 * A sharply-excluding definition of "technical" based upon the established German federal court (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) rulings (i.e. with controllable forces of nature as part of the problem solution)
 * Exclusion of trivial patents
 * Exclusion of program claims (i.e. amendment of article 5.2)
 * Full interoperability privilege
 * Reliable legal protection of interests of small and medium sized enterprises
