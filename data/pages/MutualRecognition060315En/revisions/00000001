''Members of the European Parliament successfully opposed a move by German MEP Klaus Werner Lehne to jeopardise the annual Lisbon report. At a plenary vote'' !MEPs ''rejected proposals asking the Commission for mutual recognition of patent law, which would have resulted in a flood of patent suits all over Europe, lower quality standards, worsening the software patent problem.''

Strasbourg (March 15, 2006) -- The new round of the European debate on
patent policy has started with a first victory for anti-software
patent campaigners. A majority of the European Parliament today voted
against calling on the European Commission for a legislative proposal
to stipulate the mutual recognition of national patents by the 25
member states of the EU. Such mutual recognition would make the
patents that the national patent office of any EU country grants
enforceable against companies in all other member states.

The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) and
Florian Mueller, the founder of the NoSoftwarePatents.com campaign,
lobbied MEPs to vote against the related passage of a proposed
resolution, stressing that the mutual recognition of national patents
"would result in a flood of patent suits all over Europe, lower
quality standards, and ever more software patents", among other things
because patent applicants would "shop around" to find patent offices
that are most willing to grant patents which would then be valid in
the entire EU.

The call for mutual recognition of patents that had been sponsored by
Klaus Heiner Lehne MEP. Lehne, a German conservative, [:KlausHeinerLehneEn: job as a lobbyist with the law firm Taylor Wessing], which handles many cases of
patent litigation especially in his home town of Dusseldorf and
represents large corporations in many areas of commercial law.

Mueller called the outcome of today's vote in the European Parliament
"excellent news from Strasbourg". His [http://www.no-lobbyists-as-such.com/florian-mueller-blog recently started blog] also explains the
voting mechanism, a so-called split vote, that prevented the text from going
through as proposed by Lehne. Mueller published large parts of a memorandum
that Lehne had written to other EU politicians late last year and in which
the MEP claimed that the mutual recognition of national patents would make
Europe more competitive. By calling on the European Commission to make a
proposal for the mutual recognition of patents, the European Parliament
would not have taken a final legislative decision today, but such a call
"would have been a disappointing start for [anti-software patent
campaigners] with respect to the EU's new patent policy initiative, and it
would have had negative effects for the future", he added.

Benjamin Henrion of the FFII welcomes the European
Parliament's decision because this way the parliament "keeps all options
open for the future of the European patent system" in light of the European
Commission's [http://consultation.ffii.org/ ongoing consultation on patent policy], which is preparatory to
new legislative proposals that EU observers expect the Commission to put
forward after the summer. Henrion said it would have been "a pity if Lehne's
proposal had slipped through as one of 67 items of a resolution on the EU's
Lisbon Agenda for innovation and economic policy".

Rufus Pollock, director of FFII UK, calls on companies and individuals who
are concerned about software patents to participate in the EU's consultation
on patent policy: "Today was a great result for us, but there will be many
more and bigger challenges ahead as the Commission prepares new proposals
concerning patent policy. It's very important that many companies and
individuals write to the Commission before the deadline on March 31.
Answering the [http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/indprop/patent/consultation_en.htm Commission's questionnaire] 
is tricky, but the FFII has set up a [http://consultation.ffii.org Web site that provides further explanation],
or people can also use [http://www.no-lobbyists-as-such.com/florian-mueller-blog/position-paper/ Müller's position paper]
and submit it in their name."

Today's resolution of the European Parliament was based on motion
B6-0162/2006, which had been jointly introduced by the chairpersons of
the three largest groups in the parliament (EPP-ED, PES, ALDE).

At the request of EPP-ED and ALDE, paragraph 43 was subject to a split
vote. The proposed text without the words "small" and "mutual
recognition" was carried, while a majority voted against proposals to
insert those words.

Piia-Noora Kauppi MEP took the initiative in the EPP-ED group meeting
yesterday evening to have her group support the text which was
carried today.
