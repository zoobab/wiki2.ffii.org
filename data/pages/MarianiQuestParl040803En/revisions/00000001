In response to our Urgent Appeal, Thierry Marriani (UMP) (French MP, from same majority as President Chirac) has filed a written question to the French Minister of Economy:

 Mr. Thierry Mariani draws the attention of Mr. minister of State, Minister for the economy,
 finances and industry about the European draft Directive on software patents. Indeed, it
 seems that this directive was the subject of a political agreement on May 18, 2004,
 agreement having to be ratified at a forthcoming session of the Council "Competitiveness"
 in September 2004. However, according to some concerns, the Head of the French State would
 have declared into 2002 that "authorizing patents of software would put Europe under the
 heel of American companies". Consequently, He requests him to indicate to him the French
 position on this subject.
