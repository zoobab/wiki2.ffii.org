 Software patents
 GPLv2 had a tame patent clause. Today we're seeing 
 some new licenses with aggressive patent clauses, 
 but these may backfire in practice. For example, if
 a patent holder sues me, and my license penalises me
 if I initiate patent litigation, then I'm punished 
 if I counter-sue. In that situation, the free software
 developer would be restricted, and the proprietary 
 software developer would not be restricted. So GPLv3 
 has a strengthened patent clause, but it's still 
 conservative. If we learn that a more aggressive clause
 would be better, that can be changed in GPLv4, I suppose,
 but for now, we have to make sure we do no harm.
