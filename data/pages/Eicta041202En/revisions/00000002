== Overview ==

EICTA published an English translation of an article originally [[http://www.openmagazine.nl/node/view/124|published in Dutch]] by [[http://www.openmagazine.nl|OpenMagazine]].

The only trace left [[http://www.google.de/search?q=cache:NCGTn0HBn4EJ:www.patents4innovation.org/+brinkhorst+computer+programs+patentable+europe&hl=de&client=firefox-a|is a Google cache of a page with a (non-working) link]] to that page.

!OpenMagazine is published under [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/|this Creative Commons license]], which

 * requires attribution (none is given in the EICTA article)
 * forbids derivative works (a translation is a derivative work according to the license)
 * requires the license terms of the text to be made known to readers (this is not done on the EICTA site)
 * forbids commercial use (as patents4innovation is a corporate lobbying site, this part of the license could be infringed as well)

We have confirmed with an editor of !OpenMagazine that EICTA did not ask for permission to be relieved of any of these requirements. Additionally, the same issue of !OpenMagazine also published a [[http://www.openmagazine.nl/node/view/125|reaction]] (in Dutch) by [[ReinierBakelsEn| Reinier Bakels]], in which he, among others, corrected some factual errors in Brinkhorst's text. None of those corrections are mentioned or referred to by EICTA either.

It is strange that an organisation which claims to be very much in favour of strong intellectual property protection, acts entirely disrespectful as far as other people's intellectual achievements are concerned. Maybe the reason they lobby so heavily for software patents and claim that copyright cannot protect anything, stems from the fact that they simply do not understand that copyright covers much more than literal copies. This incident perfectly illustrates how "rewriting a copyrighted work into something different that still means the same" is still an act of copyright infringement.
