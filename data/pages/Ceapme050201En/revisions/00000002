                    Press Release 1st February 2005


        Restart the Process on the EU Software Patent Directive


 Brussels  "Restarting the process on the software patent directive
 would increase the chances for arriving at a balanced decision, and
 would be conducive to the reputation of EU democracy. Starting from the
 Commission's original proposal, this process has been suffering from a
 dogmatic approach to patent law and a set of priorities in which the
 demands of a few large players were put above any economic logic." 

 The foregoing was stated by Mario Ohoven, President of the Conféderation
 Européenne des Associations de Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (CEA-PME)
 ahead of a decision by the Legal Affairs Committee in the European
 Parliament on a possible restart of the process on the software patent
 directive.

 As president of CEA-PME, Mr. Ohoven represents more than 500,000 small
 and medium-sized enterprises in total. He pointed out that companies of
 all sizes would like to achieve a state of legal certainty at the
 earliest opportunity. However, the current proposal of the EU Council
 has been under heavy attack since May of last year, and it would be more
 likely to result in a failure of the process or an exacerbation of the
 very problem that it should solve. "In Brussels everyone knows that
 there is not a large number of countries that would still support last
 year's political agreement anymore in a free vote today", Mr. Ohoven
 said. He cited as an example the announcement by the German government
 that it would, in the future, introduce the constructive suggestions of
 the German parliament into the European debate. Those call for
 substantial changes to the Council's current proposal.
