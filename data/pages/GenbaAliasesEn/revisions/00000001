 * the various sources are put together into /var/www/adm/etc/aliases by cronjob /var/www/adm/bin/hourly.knecht.  Sources include
   * manually edited aliases /var/www/adm/etc/aliases.src
   * project mailing list aliases /var/www/ffii/assoc/home/projaliases.txt
   * ffii member aliases /var/www/ffii/assoc/home/nenri/verein/uidmail
 * /var/www/adm/etc/aliases is copied to /etc/aliases by hourly.root
   * editable source of hourly.root is in /var/www/adm/bin/hourly.root, but is not used
   * the used version is editable only by root and stored in /usr/local/sbin/hourly.root
 * hourly.knecht is started from knecht crontab /var/www/adm/cron/crontab.knecht
 * hourly.root is started from root crontab /var/www/adm/cron/crontab.root
   * crontab mustn't be loaded automatically from /var/www/adm/cron/* by any scripts.  If automatic loading is necessary, only a copy from a directory which can be written only by the concerned user is acceptable
