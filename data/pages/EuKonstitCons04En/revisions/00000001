== Consiliar/Soviet Union of European Republics ? ==

The proposed constitution perpetuates the current undemocratic system of the EU, wherein legislative power is wielded mainly by the Executive.  It cements the EU as a "Union of Councils", i.e. a consiliar (soviet) union, with Council/Commission acting as "politbureau" where much of the legislative process takes place in the dark without supervision by any parliament.
