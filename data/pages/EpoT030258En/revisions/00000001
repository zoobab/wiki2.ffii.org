[:HartmutPilchEn: Hartmut Pilch] comments:

Possibly the EPO is trying to prove that they are can go even beyond the [:EpoT950931En: Controlling Pension Benefits System decision of 2000] whose doctrine is the basis of the European Commission's and Council's directive proposal.

If the legislator had intended to make business methods patentable as soon as they are implemented by a computer or other "technical means", he would not have listed "methods for doing business" in the list of items which are not inventions in the sense of patent law.  The EPO is once again going straight against the written law, which it pretends to misunderstand.  It is thereby moving a few millimiters beyond the Pension Benefits doctrine of 2000, with help of whose warped logic the EPO was occasionally was able to reject a business method patent.  Thus the rate of business patent rejections by the EPO can be expected to sink from 1% to 0%.  See [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/tech/ Why Amazon One-Click Shopping is Patentable under the CEC/JURI/Council Directive Proposal]

This will then be used by [:SwpatharbourEn: Malcolm Harbour], [:SwpatjwuermelingEn: Joachim Wuermeling], [:SwpatamccarthyEn: Arlene McCarthy], [:SwpatmingoranceEn: Francisco Mingorance] and other protagonists of the patent movement for their current PR strategy, which is to pose as critics of the EPO who are interested in preventing a "further drift toward patentability of business methods" and for this purpose want to codify the "status quo" of Pension Benefits.
