  The patent situation well and truly sucks. 

  We were prepared to use a two-pass algorithm that gave
  equivalent results at a speed hit, but we negotiated the
  deal with Creative so that we were able to use the zfail
  method without having to actually pay any cash. It was
  tempting to take a stand and say that our products were
  never going to use any advanced Creative/3dlabs products
  because of their position on patenting gaming software
  algorithms, but that would only have hurt the users.

Creative Labs allows their partner id Software to continue using the technique on condition that they also develop drivers for patented audio extensions (which so far were not developped by the Doom team because they are specific to Creative Labs).

John Carmack, lead programmer of id Software, is a [http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=967 known opponent] of software patents.
