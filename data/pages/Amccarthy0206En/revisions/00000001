!McCarthy's entourage has claimed that this paper did not reflect !McCarth's own views but those of Willy Rothley.
This rumor was spread with the intention of giving !McCarthy some more room for distancing herself from the early pro-patent paper, but she later did not use this room nor is the rumor very credible, although it is probably true that Rothley worked on the dossier before !McCarthy was chosen to become the SPE's rapporteur on it.
