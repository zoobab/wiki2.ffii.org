  !20040705  Worsening software patent quality - no progress in 15 years

  ...

  At the request of a magazine, I updated my software patent statistics 
  for up until the end of December 2003.  Consistently for the last ten 
  years, software patent pendency and quality have gotten worse.  PTO 
  management is fundamentally incompetent to oversee software patent 
  prosecution. The consequences?  By the end of 2004, there should be over 
  200,000 software patents, at least 120,000 of which are invalid but 
  litigatable.  I am available to bust this crap :-)

It should be noted that the remaining 80,000 presumably valid patents are also
mostly trivial.  The criteria of the patent system, even when correctly applied, do not eliminate trivial
patents, especially not in the area of software.

The situation at the European Patent Office does not appear to be any better.
