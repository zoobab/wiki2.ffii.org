''Apparently a Microsoft frontend similar to CompTIA.  ACT activists from the USA regularly appear at meetings in Brussels to present themselves as CEO of some SME and ask for software patents or other policies which are in line with Microsoft's current campaigns and which are claimed to be conformant to competition principles such as "let the market choose the winners and losers".  As with CompTIA, the main thrust of ACT seems to be to use these principles as a basis to argue against state efforts to curb anti-competitive practises of Microsoft, who is among the members (we do not know how much of the fees they pay).''
