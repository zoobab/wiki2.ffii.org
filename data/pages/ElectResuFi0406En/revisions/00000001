 * Greens lost one of their two seats :-(
 * KD lost their only seat (but their representative in the old parliament had switched to Kokoomus PPE-DE so this could also be seen as a loss for Kokoomus [:which :is largely on our side unlike many other right-wing parties])
 * All others maintained the same number of seats they had in the old parliament.
 * [:PiiaNooraKauppiEn: Kauppi] is back with a lot more personal votes than last time :-)
 * Of the 14 elected MEPs 7 have publicly stated they are against swpats and/or voted accordingly in the old parliament. The opinions of 5 new ones are unknown and 2 voted for sw patents in September 2003.
