= Janelly Fourtou supports the Commission to reject the Eurolinux petition =

----

''At the reception of the Eurolinux petition in the petition comitee of the European Parliament on the 30th september 2003, Janelly Fourtou asked the president to reject the Eurolinux petition arguing that the Parliament has already voted on the matter. She was supporting the argumentation of Anthony Howard (CEC) who argued for rejecting the petition. Hopefully, the president of the petition comitee accepted the petition because the right of petition is a stronger right.''
