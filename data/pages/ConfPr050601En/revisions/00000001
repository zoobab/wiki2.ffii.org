''Brussels, 23 May 2005 - The FFII is proud to announce a new conference on patent policy making, co-sponsored by four prominent members of the European Parliament and by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA). On June 1st, politicians, law scholars and leading businessmen will give an overview of what they think about the proposed European software patents directive.''

On the heels of the EPO-FFII event on May 24th and following previous successful events such as the conferences in November and April 2004, the FFII is again co-organising a conference in Brussels on the topic of software patent policy in the EU. Partners supporting this event are the CCIA and EPP !MEPs Jerzy Buzek (former Prime Minister of Poland), Valdis Dombrovskis, Tunne Kelam and Zuzana Roithová, as well as numerous !SMEs.

Originally presented as a narrow harmonisation measure, the proposed software patents directive has spurred impassioned debate that reflects the enormous stakes for European software developers and users. By deciding what may or may not be patented, the directive will determine how information and knowledge processes are regulated and controlled.

The Council's version of the directive remains largely unchanged from what the Commission proposed over three years ago, despite the expanded debate. The Commission's refusal to review the directive puts the
burden on the new Parliament to tackle an extraordinarily controversial and complex issue with no additional guidance.

This conference will examine software patents and the proposed Directive from a range of perspectives:

 * the U.S. experience
 * European investments in knowledge creation and use
 * competition in software, Internet services, and electronic commerce
 * social and economic interests of new member countries
 * comparative advantage in the global economy
 * views of individual companies and the industry at large
 * legislative approaches

With participation of stakeholders from both sides of the debate and several experts on hand, this event promises to become another informative and interesting experience. We hope to meet you there!

Note that on 2nd June, the Greens/EFA group of the EP will organise a [http://www.greens-efa.org/en/agenda/detail.php?id=1726 related conference on the topic of Free Software and Software Patents].
