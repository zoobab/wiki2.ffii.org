  WRITTEN QUESTION E-3502/06
  by David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    EPLA
  
  The aim of the EPLA (European Patent Litigation Agreement) is to harmonise
  the diverging interpretation of the EPC in all states that would sign the
  agreement.
  
  This is essentially the same goal as the software patent directive which
  was rejected last year by the European Parliament with near unanimity.
  
  Does the European Commission agree with the above?

  E-3502/06EN
  Answer given by Mr McCreevy
  on behalf of the Commission
  (15.9.2006)
  
  
  The rejected proposal for a Directive on the patentability of computer-
  implemented inventions aimed at harmonising substantive patent law within
  the European Community for dealing with inventions which make use of
  software. It was a proposal for a legislative instrument meant to clarify
  and codify the legal situation in that particular field.
  
  The draft EPLA, on the other hand, is a draft agreement prepared within the
  European Patent Organisation on an integrated judicial system for the
  settlement of litigation concerning European patents. Such a system aims at
  a unified interpretation of substantive rules of existing patent law
  through a unitary jurisdiction, but does not change these rules.
  
  The Commission is therefore of the view that these two instruments are not
  comparable.
