"The question of patent law, also important for industry, particularly the
patentability of computer-implemented inventions, was raised by several
Members, including David HAMMERSTEIN MINTZ (Greens/EFA, ES) and Esko SEPPÄNNEN
(GUE/NGL, FI). The MEPs defended open source software as a way of offering
greater access to technology for everyone as it cost less. Furthermore it was
a way of encouraging young people to be innovative. Mrs Reding said she was
very aware of this problem, which brought copyright into conflict with freedom
of use. "Ultimately", she said, "it is a commercial problem and we have to
reconcile interests". She reminded Members that the directive on the subject
would return to Parliament for second reading after it had passed before the
Council of Ministers."

DG Infso having been very involved (and critical) in the elaboration of the
directive, and given rumours that the software patents directive would move to
her future DG, Mrs Reding was questionned on this by the Green David
Hammerstein (Spain) and by Vittorio Prodi (ALDE, Italy). She provided vague
answers and could not elaborate : 

"It is the same old fight between those who want to protect copyright and
those who want everything free ; I think the open source is good but we need
to pay the authors; in May the Council choose to take a step forward, (...)
McCreevy will be in charge, (...) the ball is not in the camp of the
Commission anymore."

=== Charly McCreevy (Internal Market) ===

The successor of Bolkestein will be the lead Commissionner for the software
patent directive; he was asked 2 questions, by Heide Rühle (Greens/EFA, DE)
Germany) on software patents and open source software SMEs, and by Maria
Berger (PSE, AT).  His response shows that he has bought into some of the common belief statements about the universally beneficial effects of whatever comes under the label "intellectual property", but may be more aware of the limits of his knowledge (and thus more open) than Reding.

McCreevy answers regarding patents in the Written Specific Questionnaire:

14. What is your attitude to intellectual property rights in general?
Would you envisage action to assist small firms financially and
otherwise to acquire, defend and exploit their ideas and inventions?
What is your attitude to criticisms of the patent system (e.g. from
the open-source community), and would you consider revisiting the
European Patent Convention in order to take them into account (say by
raising the hurdle for inventive step)?

Intellectual property rights are a very important means to stimulate
innovation and thereby enhance growth.Whether we talk about patents,
trademarks, or copyright, the economic dimension of the sectors and
industries benefiting from intellectual property protection in Europe
is very significant and has enormous potential.

Beyond the economic dimension, there is also of course the more
qualitative dimension of our creativity and cultural diversity. The
contribution of robust intellectual property protection to achieving
the Lisbon objective (which, let us not forget, is about becoming the
best knowledge-based economy in the world) is clear. It is also clear
that innovation and creativity are at risk to piracy and
counterfeiting.To best serve our economic objectives, intellectual
property protections need to be framed not only with rights- holders
in mind, but also consumers and competitors. They also need to be
enforceable and enforced. It is indeed important that SMEs are able to
benefit from such protections they are among our most inventive firms.
Our job is therefore to design protections which are accessible to
them. As far as I can judge at present, this should not require
SME-specific instruments.

For example, the adoption of the Community Patent would make EU-wide
patent protection significantly cheaper and simpler to obtain and
thereby help SMEs in particular to bring their innovations to market.
I can only regret that efforts to create the Community patent have not
been successful.This illustrates one of the weaknesses of the Lisbon
process - lack of delivery!I am of course aware of the various
criticisms which are made of the patent system. I pledge myself to
conducting my policy deliberations in an open and broad-based way and
to seeking balanced solutions. As for the European Patent Convention,
this is of course an international agreement which is independent of
the Community. As patent protection is of interest to companies of all
sizes, I do not see that reducing its scope is the obvious way to make
the patent system more accessible to SMEs.

===  Günter Verheugen  ===

Supports SME, ability to innovation and flexibility were regarded as key to success.

"Die Innovationsfähigkeit und die Flexibilität der KMU seien entscheidende Faktoren und die KMU, das Rückrat der europäischen Wirtschaft, müssten in die Lage versetzt werden, den neuen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden."

 * archive streams and audio etc.
 * extract swpat specific parts
 * Verify Reding report 
   * listen to [[http://80.200.251.166/public/epmp3/29-09%20Reding.mp3|mp3 file]], transscribe 
   * make phone calls to find out who wrote the report    
   * Did Viviane Reding really confuse copyright with patent law? Did the Greens really confuse the free vs proprietary question with the copyright vs patents question? Against which accusations did they have to "defend open source software"? 
   * "The question of patent law, also important for industry  particularly the patentability of computer-implemented inventions" --> Who says this?  To the naive reader, it means that the "software industry" needs patents.  What was said by Greens, what by Reding, what by journalists?  
   * Get the report rectified.  Complain?
