''German social democrat Erika Mann became known in 2000 as an activist against software patents and filed some forces of nature amendments in the Industry Committee in early 2003.  In April 2003 she suddenly switched sides and became a major activist of the pro-patent lobby, using her skills to promote their cause and spread doubt about "realism" of Rocard, while avoiding to argue about desirability of software patents.''
