Amsterdam, September 5 2004


Dear Mrs Dijksma,

We write to inform you of our concerns regarding the way the Dutch EU 
Presidency is conducting itself with respect to European procedures and the 
Protocol on the Role of National Parliaments in the European Union. The road 
taken by the Dutch government negates the Protocol on the Role of National 
Parliaments and weakens European democracy.

On May10th Minister Brinkhorst misinformed the Dutch Parliament about the 
Directive on Computer-Implemented Inventions, and voted for the Council's 
proposal on May 18th based on that misrepresentation. As a result, the Dutch 
Parliament has adopted a motion by MP Van Dam calling the government to 
withdraw its vote.

The Dutch Parliament required two sessions of the Committee on Economic 
Affairs to come to realize the issues with the Council's text, and how 
detrimental it would be for SMEs and innovation. The Directive's text is 
overcomplicated, with double negations, duplicitous qualifications 
("exceptions" that are always true) and undefined exclusions. The Parliament 
fears "excesses" with regards to the patentability of software. Empirical 
evidence shows patents on software impede innovation.

The Dutch Parliament concluded that since there was ongoing discussion of the 
Directive, the government should abstain from the Council's vote for 
political agreement.

Minister Brinkhorst stated in a debate on the matter that for constitutional 
reasons the Council's vote cannot be reversed. The State Secretary also 
misrepresented the facts in the debate on the Van Dam motion, by calling the 
political agreement a "common position," thereby presenting the non-binding 
agreement as a binding one. Furthermore, a Brussels Permanent Representative 
said the vote cannot be changed {1}. In these actions, the Dutch
government has spread critical incorrect information about European Union 
democratic procedures three times {2}.

The Protocol on the Role of National Parliaments in the European Union assures 
Parliaments early access to legislative proposals. The Parliaments of the 10 
new members of the Union have not had early access, since the translations of 
the EU Council's political agreement have only very recently become 
available. 

Since the translations became available during the Parliaments' recess 
periods, it would be appropriate to add a short extension to the six weeks 
period provided under the Protocol, within which national Parliaments may 
render their conclusions regarding the Council's political agreement. No 
shortening of the six weeks period can be allowed.

Without the six weeks review period, the Parliaments of the new members are 
denied the rights the Protocol provides for. There is no ground to deny the 
new members these rights, since, so far as we know, there is no jurisprudence 
on the Protocol, and no mention of this situation in the Treaty of Accession. 
The new members of the European Union must enjoy their full rights to address 
the Directive.

Eastern Europe would bear the hardest burden in the outcome of this decision. 
SMEs in Europe can little afford to compete in a context that would include 
the kinds of patents this Directive will validate. The new Eastern European 
members of the Union are hardly in a better position than the rest of Europe. 
Eastern Europe will never own its software industry under the Council's text.

Europe needs a sensible patent system. The Council's misleading text is no 
contribution to that. Critical amendments contributed by the European 
Parliament, including a key definition clarifying the term 'technical,' were 
discarded by the Council for the dissembling language that they favor {3}.

The Council worked entirely on the basis of text developed in the JURI 
committee {4}. They simply discarded clear language such as 'programs are not 
inventions' of the European Patent Convention and clarifications like 'data 
processing is not a field of technology' and 'publication and distribution of 
software is never a patent infringement' of the Parliament.

We believe the Directive must be discussed as a B-item in the Council, not 
allowed to pass as a mere formality under the A-item agenda points. The 
Netherlands has adopted a motion showing a lack of faith in the vote. There 
has been discussion all over Europe regarding the misleading nature of the 
Directive and the problematic conduct of the vote. A large group of Ministers 
joined in supporting Germany in including a critical text that was dropped at 
the very moment of the vote, putting those Ministers, including a substitute 
Danish Minister, in a difficult position. The Directive should not be handled 
by non-involved ministers {5}.

Every Parliament in the European Union has the right to debate the Directive 
on Computer-Implemented Inventions, and to render their opinions. Any Council 
member may unilaterally act to transfer an A-item decision indicating a mere 
formality to the list of B-item agenda points {5}. Every member of the 
Council has the right to change their present vote {2}. Any Council member 
may unilaterally block any proposed shortening of the six weeks review 
period. All of the national members of the European Union have the freedom 
and the right to engage in any decision that determines their future.

The proceedings surrounding the Directive on Computer-Implemented Inventions 
are a particularly transparent instance representing democratic deficits in 
the European Union. The misrepresentations of the procedure and of the status 
of the Council's political agreement, and the failure to apply the Protocol 
on the Role of National Parliaments to the new members of the Union in the 
deliberations, are not only signals of a failure to conduct the deliberations 
on the Directive in an open and accountable manner. They also represent a 
necessary and worthy occasion to set the right precedent for democratic 
process.

Please require the Council and the Dutch Presidency to make clear that 
democracy is here to stay in Europe. 

President of the permanent Parliamentary Commission on European Affairs, we hope you will forward this 
letter to the COSAC members as well.
