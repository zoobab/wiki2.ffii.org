== General notes from the seminar  ==
 * must "bring" economic value to the patent system (so it does not have now?)
 * granting is for economic value and for the interest of society
 * legal certainity depends on the quality
 * "rigid" examination by expert scientists, three examiners
 * most patents are reduced in scope before granting
 * "opposition procedure" guarantees quality
   * Note:doesn't M$ apply for two patents per day, who shall do the the "guard" for the EPO?

== Wolfgang Pilch  ==
 * is principal director of patent information
 * innovation is not over when product is developed, it is over when it is sold
 * Stressed that all documents are "available free of charge"
   * Note: searching however can have high cost and be a big problem...
 * Stressed that Universities seem to have the "Not invented here" problem while companies look if somebody has done the same before (look into the patents first)

== Stefan Steinbrenner  ==
EPO is under two contraints:
 * current law
 * what people are applying (what the customer wants)
   * Note: Shouldn't the EPO act like a public authority which simply implements the law and not like a private company which follows what it's customers (the applicants for patents) want, yet regretfully bound by law, seeing law as a "contraint"?

 * TBA had 20 cases in 5 years, before there were 20 cases in 20 years
 * Board 351 decides and other Boards decided to be in line with the decisions of Board 351, so "European case so appears to be harmonized"

Described the EPC/EPO relationship and it boiled down to:
 * EPC: "as such"
 * EPO: "not technical" (of course he didn't say it in this way)
   * Note: But technical is a principle of EPC, so if "as such" meant "technical" the word "technical" would have been used.
