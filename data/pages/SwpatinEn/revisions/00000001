''India's patent law states that computer programs per se are not inventions in the sense of the law.  Program claims are not allowed and the patent office's [:SwpatRulesInEn: examination guidelines] seem to take the software exclusion more seriously than in Europe.   Multinational corporations are currently hurrying to open R&D centers in India.''

== Synopsis ==

 * [http://wiki.ffii.org/Nath0412En Good analysis of the changed wording in the ordinance]
 * India's patent law states that computer programs are not invention in the sense of the law
 * Indian Patent law knows patentable inventions as opposed to non-patentable invention (<> non-inventions)
 * The patent office has been softening this, similar to the EPO, but there is more counter-pressure than elsewhere, partially due to the belief that patents are an arm of already-developed countries such as the US against developing countries such as India
 * Currently, [:EubsaProgEn: program claims] are not permitted in India, and the [:SwpatusEn: US] is exerting pressure to have them permitted.
   * The newspaper articles to not give exact indications as to how high this issue is on the US patent lobby's agenda, but it is there without doubt.  The purpose of the term "program product" is to trigger [:SwpattripsEn: TRIPs].
