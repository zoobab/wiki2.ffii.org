''The IPR Enforcement Directive part 1 was narrowly passed through the European Parliament in early 2004, without criminal sanctions.  Part 2 consists in these criminal sanctions and is being pushed by the Commission in Autumn 2005.  The idea of legislating across the board on everything called "intellectual property" has been strongly criticised, and there is a particular danger that abuses of such property rights will be aggravated.''
