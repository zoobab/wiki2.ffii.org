''21 October 2005 -- we need to prepare the accounting data and resulting reports about the current fiscal year of FFII as soon as possible.''

== Currently available data ==

 * [http://www.ffii.org/intern/financ/ raw data], apparently not there yet 
   * see also ffii db ledger
 * [http://www.ffii.org/money/log/2005/index.en.html last report]

== Things To Do ==

=== Contact accountant ===

 * work out categorisation together (but start with ours even before that)

=== Meeting 2005-10-21  ===

 * blasum, jahleff, phm @ ffii-muc-office 
 * starting 10-11



== Other Financial Affairs ==

 * need regular procedure for requesting funding and people to exercise it
   * proposal: a reasoned written request to konto@ffii.org with endorsement of a trusted activist, so as to unburden the treasurer
