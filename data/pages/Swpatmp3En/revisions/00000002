The patent on MP3 would be no problem at all (you could just use Ogg Vorbis) if it had not become a de-facto standard and part of some formal standards (MPEG-1).

"The patent on mp3" does not exist. There are several patents that cover the mp3 format, and they do not just cover mp3 compression, they cover a whole lot more. This is the first claim of the base patent on mp3 compression (EP287578):
=== Quote: Digital coding process for transmitting and/or storing acoustic signals, specifically music signals, comprising the following steps. ===
 * N samples of the acoustic signal are converted into M spectral coefficients;
 * said M spectral coefficients are subjected to quantisation at a first level;
 * after coding by means of an entropic encoder the number of bits required to represent all the quantized spectral  
 coefficients is checked;
 * when the required number of bits does not correspond to a specified number of bits quantization and coding are repeated  
 in subsequent steps, each at a modified quantization level, until the number of bits required for representation reaches 
 the specified number of bits, and
 * additionally to the data bits the required quantization level is transmitted and/or stored.

This covers any and all compression methods which first do a spectral analysis, and which then in a loop

 * quantize the sound data (i.e., represent the sound waves by discrete numbers)
 * "encode" the sound data (regardless of how this encoding is done)
 * use an entropic encoder (such as Huffman or arithmetic encoding)
 * check whether the resulting size is smaller than the target size and if not, execute the loop again.

Finally, to infringe on these claims, you must also store the quantization level (i.e., how many times you looped). I hope you can see is a lot broader than just mp3-compression. And in fact that's normal, since that's the way patents work: they're always as broad as possible.

One way to get around this patent, is to do the entropic encoding outside the loop, and estimate its effects inside the loop. The result will be that you will only be able to approximate the final bitrate of your stream, however. Given that oggenc in my experience always generates files with a higher bitrate than what you specify on the command line (if you specify a bitrate instead of a quality), it wouldn't surprise me if the ogg people in fact use this workaround.

Remember: you never ever patent something specific. You always patent what you claim is "an underlying invention". You never patent Linux, but you can patent some algorithm used in the virtual memory subsystem. You never patent Microsoft Word, but you can patent spell checking principle (claimed as "method" or "technique", of course). You never patent a music format, but you can patent an algorithm used while encoding music in a format.
