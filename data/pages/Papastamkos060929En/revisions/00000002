  WRITTEN QUESTION E-4042/06
  by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    European Patent Court
  
  In a recent speech, the Commissioner responsible for the internal market,
  Mr McCreevy, came out in favour of the proposed European Patent Litigation
  Agreement. Non-governmental organisations and other civil society
  stakeholders point out the risk that this agreement will circumvent last
  year's vote in the European Parliament which rejected the Commission's
  proposal for a directive on the protection of software patent rights. The
  agreement provides for the creation of a special European Patent Court
  which would adjudicate in disputes concerning patent rights which have been
  recognised by the European Patent Office.
  
  In the light of the above:
  
  1. Can the Commission confirm that it does not support any attempt to
  circumvent the European Parliament's decision concerning the directive on
  the protection of software patent rights?
  
  2. Does the Commission support the creation of a special patent court
  outside the institutional structures of the EU?
  
  3. In the Commission's view, are the conditions for the application of
  Article 300, paragraphs 1 and 6 of the EC Treaty met?
