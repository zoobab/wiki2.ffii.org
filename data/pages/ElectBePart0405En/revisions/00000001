The greens (http://www.ecolo.be) are opposed to the current proposal (the same could be said of all the Greens of Europe, I think).
PS is also clearly opposing software patents and has been active in opposing the McCarthy line within the European Socialist group (PSE).
[:OlgaZrihenEn: Olga Zrihen] has been particularly helpful.
Independent of the voting results, which may contain compromises with McCarthy, it can be said that PS has been the most helpful belgian force in the EP.
