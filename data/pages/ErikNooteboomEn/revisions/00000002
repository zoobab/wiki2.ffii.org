  Erik Nooteboom
  European Commission

  Erik Nooteboom is head of the industrial property unit in the
  European Commission's internal market directorate-general and is
  described by many as the key man for IP in Brussels. Indeed, 
  Nooteboom has held responsibility for the Community patent,
  the computer-implemented inventions directive, the Community
  trade mark and the Community design, and the enforcement directive.
  In addition he deals with any WIPO and WTO related matters and
  works in close cooperation with OHIM and the European Patent Office.

  Producing results is what matters for the Dutchman, who joined
  the Commission 1987 from a background as legal adviser. He has been
  in his current position since 1998. Without his hard work in the
  past year, it remains doubtful how smoothly the linkage between the
  EU's OHIM-administered Community trade mark system and the
  WIPO-administered international trade mark system, the Madrid Protocol,
  would have been put in place. The link was a historical step in the IP
  field, allowing trade mark owners around the world to extend their
  existing registration to all 25 EU countries and CTM holders to extend
  their registration to all Madrid member countries.

  Nooteboom is also behind the discussions to abolish national searches
  as well as proposals to reduce CTM registration and renewal fees. More
  recently he initiated a process aimed at fostering more cooperation
  between national trade mark offices and OHIM, a move pushed for by EU
  member states.

  In the coming year Nooteboom will play an important role in the
  Commission's plans to improve the EU patent system and restart the
  Community patent discussions, which stalled in May 2004 after member
  states failed to come to an agreement on the system's scope. Nooteboom
  has clearly expressed his frustration about this and as long as he is
  around, IP owners should not give up their hopes for an EU-wide patent
  system.

  '''The most controversial issue Nooteboom has been involved in during
  the past year is the so-called software patent directive'''. Debates
  seemed to have reached their climax at the end of last year when
  discussions between member states, the European Parliament and the
  Council of Ministers stalled and the Commission threatened to scrap
  the law entirely. But the Commission's continued discussions with all
  those involved eventually pushed the draft law further through the EU's
  law-making process, although it finally hit the buffers in the European
  Parliament in July this year. The Commission is also expected to push
  forward EU accession to the international design registration system,
  the Hague Agreement.

  Producing results is what matters for the Dutchman, who joined the
  Commission 1987 from a background as legal adviser. He has been in his
  current position since 1998.
