COSAC is a forum for involvement of national Parliaments in EU lawmaking.  It has its legal basis in an additional protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty.  National Parliaments have largely been marginalised by the process of EU legislation.  This becomes particularly clear when looking at how national parliaments were misinformed and ignored by the fusioned executive bodies in the EU Council during the Council's first reading of the software patent directive in 2004.
