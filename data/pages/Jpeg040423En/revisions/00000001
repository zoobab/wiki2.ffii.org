= 31 Companies sued for use of JPEG, shareware companies attacked =

Forgent Inc is suing 31 companies for use of the JPEG format and claims to have obtained license payments from numerous others.
The claims are based on a patent which has also been (illegally) granted by the European Patent Office and which would become enforcable if the EU Commission and Council Working Party have [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/ their way] (but not if the [http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/ Parliament's version of the directive] is accepted).

Forgent's law office Gilchrist & Jenkins has written to Europe Shareware asking them to buy a license.
