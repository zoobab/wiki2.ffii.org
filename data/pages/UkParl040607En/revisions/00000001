A long debate in the House of Commons on the Patents Bill (on facilitation of patent enforcement). 

It's clear that the [:PatentDefenceUnionEn: Patent Defence Union] seems to have got its message over quite successfully.   Many !MPs now favor legislation that would subsidise aggressive patent enforcement strategies such as those of PDU founder Mitchell of [:SwxaiAllvoiceEn: Allvoice].   Similar legislation was proposed by [:SwpatamccarthyEn: Arlene McCarthy] in summer of 2003 in an attempt to sway opposition by the !MEPs to her pro-patent course and appear more SME-friendly.

Even in the [http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2004-06-07.39.0 new improved presentation], it's a pretty lengthy read, for
not an awful lot of enlightenment, 
but quite revealing for some of the broader views taken by !MPs on
patents (or rather: by the handful of interested !MPs).

[:DavidTaylorEn: David Taylor] made quite an
[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-06-07.52.0 effective intervention against swpat] 
although the minister dismissed it with the [http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-06-07.69.1 usual patent propaganda text chunk] (claiming that software patents have been granted for many decades and the proposed EU directive [:Intro040608En: only harmonises the status quo]).

Taylor's move is characteristic of worries that a number of backbench !MPs have about the Government's wholesale backing for the Directive.
