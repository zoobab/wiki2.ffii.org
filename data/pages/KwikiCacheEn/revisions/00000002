''7th July 2004 by phm -- FFII needs a system for automatically caching the kwiki news items that go into the RSS stream and are likely to attract attention.''

We need a script that parses either the news page SwpatcninoEn SwpatcninoDe etc themselves or or the [[http://www.ffii.org/news/rss/SwpatcninoEn-ffii.rss|latest RSS wiki newsstreams generated therefrom]] and assures that the news pages therein are cached.

For that, it needs to write to the files /var/www/kwiki/pages.lst and /etc/apache-ssl/vhost.conf.

Search for "SwpatcninoEn" in the latter file and you'll see a rewrite rule for all the caching pages.  That rule should contain the 20 most recent news items, and pages.lst also should contain them.

This script can save our server a lot of load.
