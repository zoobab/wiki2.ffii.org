= Munich City Administration: Software Patents Threaten Linux Migration =

The decision of the city of Munich to have all of the IT infrastructure of its administration migrate to Linux received media attention around the globe.

On Friday, July 23rd, the CIO of the Munich city administration, Wilhelm Hoegner, declared at a public event in front of about 70 participants that he sees the possible ratification of software patents by the EU as a major threat to the Linux migration project of the city of Munich, and to the free source development model in general. He responded to a related question from the audience, and did not deny that the decision by the city of Munich to migrate to Linux could evolve into a mistake due to software patents.

The official title of Wilhelm Hoegner is not CIO.  In German, his title is "Amtsleiter, Amt f√ºr Informations- und Datenverarbeitung", which could be translated as "head of the information and data processing department".
