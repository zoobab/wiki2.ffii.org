== Summary ==

Agencies of the United Nations are traditionally strongholds of the patent
lobby, especially in WIPO.  Treaties signed between governmental patent
movement activists at the UN level are used to preempt legislative discussions
at the national (more democratic) levels.

This may be slowly changing due to a growing presence of the "civil society"
(non-governmental organisations) at the sessions of the UN organisations
(mostly in Geneva) and due to the activities of some developing countries who have
been resisting the patent movement's agenda.
