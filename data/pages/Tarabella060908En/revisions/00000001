''The Commission cannot comment on whether or not the EU has to accede to the European Patent Convention in case it decides to join the European Patent Litigation Agreement. As in all its other answers on the topic of the EPLA, it refers to its consultation in a boilerplate, but does not provide any substantial information except that it's ignorant about the question's topic.''

  WRITTEN QUESTION by Marc Tarabella (PSE) to the Commission

  According to the questionnaire of the consultation on the future patent
  policy in Europe, the Community could become party the European Patent
  Litigation Agreement (EPLA). If the Community wants to become party to
  the EPLA, would this require the Community to first become party to the
  European Patent Convention (EPC)?

  brevet en Europe, la Communauté pourrait signer un accord sur le règlement des
  litiges en matière de brevet européen (EPLA). Si la Communauté veut signer
  l'EPLA, cela requiert-il qu'elle signe d'abord la convention sur le brevet
  européen (CBE)?

  Answer given by Mr. McCreevy
  in the name of the Commission
  (8.9.2006)

  With its question the honorable member wants to be certain about whether
  the European Community, if it wishes to sign the European Patent
  Litigation Agreement, also has to become party to the European Patent
  Convention (EPC).

  The Commission is currently in the process of examining the issue of the
  draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) and the possibility of
  moving the project forward in the context of its consultation on the
  future patent policy in Europe. The consultation was launched on 16
  January 2006 and proved to be a huge success, generating over 2 500
  answers from interested circles. A public hearing took place on 12 July
  2006. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the responses and
  drawing its conclusions. Naturally, the Parliament will be informed about
  the Commission's findings and recommendations as soon as they have been
  finalized.
  
  The question of whether the Community would first have to become party to
  the EPC, in case it wishes to sign the EPLA, is a complex question. In
  this hypothetical situation, the Commission would have to analyse the
  question in detail; currently it is unable to comment on this point.
