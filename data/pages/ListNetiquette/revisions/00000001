= Netiquette guidelines for FFII lists =

Except for the usual rules (no HTML posts, no attachments), please observe the
following for FFII's lists:

== 1. Consider using the wiki instead ==

If you want to ask a question, go ahead and ask the list. But if you want to
contribute any kind of information which may be useful later, consider using
the wiki instead. People are very busy, and it is likely that your contribution
will be forgotten if you just post it on the list. Moreover, the lists are for
notifications, questions, and discussions, and contributions are generally out
of place; they constitute noise on the lists, whereas they constitute valuable
material on the wiki.

== 2. Don't make large quotations ==

When replying to a message, please trim the quotation to the necessary two or three lines; make sure
there is only one blank line before and after the quotation; and if you want to
answer many points of the original post, consider not quoting at all and
rephrasing, as in "Considering Microsoft's new patent, I doubt that, as you
say, such-and-such, because so-and-so. But I agree with you on ..."

== 3. Take care of subject lines ==

Make your subject line be a good summary of your post. If you reply to a
message and the subject has practically changed in the course of the
discussion, change the subject line.

Please note: this is not about being pedantic - it's about people who read 100
or more emails a day, have very limited time, and will ignore messages unless
it is clear from the subject line that they are of interest to them. We want
the information you give or the question you make to reach the right people,
this is all.

== 4. Don't give information that might be useful to the bad guys ==

This applies to the wiki as well as to the public mailing lists: spies are
likely to be watching them. Our work is
mostly open, but there are exceptions - so think before you post.
