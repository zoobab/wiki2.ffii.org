An info table on software patents has been set up in Athens, 
see [[http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/st04photos/|pictures]]. 

The banner reads "Software Patents = Idea Monopolies". 100 people were there, we gave out around 3000 leaflets, including discussion with youth organisation of PASOK (panhellenic socialist movement, one of 2 large greek parties).
