Ampex was very successful as a producer of large analog tape devices in the 70-80s but nowadays no longer has successful products on they market and, like some other companies in that situation, turned to its portfolio of thousands of patents in the audio data processing area.  In doing so, Ampex was highly successful, similar to Kodak.  Ampex seems to have become a patent venture like Acacia.  A small team of patent portfolio managers and lawyers is raking in the money for the creditors and thousands of former employees.
