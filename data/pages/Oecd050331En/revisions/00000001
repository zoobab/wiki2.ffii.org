''31 March 2005 -- In an interview in the Dutch newspaper Trouw, the Head of the OECD's Information Economy Unit states that software patents would choke innovation.''

Graham Vickery, responsible for ICT research at the OECD, spoke at the presentation of an OECD report in The Hague on the use of ICT in Dutch enterprises. The report notes that the Netherlands is lagging as far as ICT innovation and productivity are concerned. The main causes are too little students in the beta sciences and research and development which "falls short according to all thinkable criteria".

Asked by [http://www.trouw.nl/ Trouw] about what he thinks about the software patents directive, Mr. Vickery replies that he thinks it would "choke innovation" and adds:

 'I share the concerns of the small European software companies about the
  law. If it comes through, it will enable endless court cases by large,
  rich companies against smaller ones. The problem with software patents
  is that software often cannot be described accurately enough. This
  easily leads to different interpretations and court cases.

  If the European Union makes software patentable, that would boil down
  to transferring money to lawyers.'
