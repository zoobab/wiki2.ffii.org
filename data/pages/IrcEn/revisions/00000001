''FFII activists are regularly meeting for internet relay chat (IRC) sessions.''

== Schedule ==

Most active in evening hours, after 20.00, but sometimes earlier too.
Especially on [:FfiiprojPriorEn: monday evening].

== Joining the chat ==

If you don't know much about IRC: just point your web browser to [http://chat.vrijschrift.org/ this web page], change the "nickname" to something friendlier than CGI123, leave the other fields as is and press the "login" button. 

If you know something about IRC: Or join the channel #bxl-ffii on irc.freenode.net. 
URL: irc://freenode/bxl-ffii (Useful if you have your IRC Client integrated with your browser, e.g. if you are using mozilla or firefox and have the
[https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&os=Windows&id=16 Chatzilla extension] installed which can be installed with a few clicks.
== Mozilla add-ons ==

Off-topic, but related: If you are using Mozilla or Firefox, there are some other very worthwile extensions:
 * "Session Saver" - saves your current Mozilla Windows/Tabs and restores your last set of tabs when you start mozilla, this even works after broswer and hard system crashes.
 * More infos: [http:RecommendedMozillaExtensionsEn Recommended Mozilla extenstions]

== Chat-tools ==

 * [https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&os=Windows&id=16 Chatzilla], an extension for [http://www.mozilla.org Mozilla] Webbrowsers (install is just point and click)
 * Cross-Platform
   * [http://irssi.org/ irssi] -- Perl-based, very extensible
   * [http://gaim.sf.net Gaim]
 * [http://www.mirc.com/ mIRC] - Shareware for MS Windows
 * !MacIntosh clients
   * [http://www.ircle.com/ IRCle] 
   * [http://colloquy.info/ Colloquy] simple, nice and free client for Mac OS X

== Staying tuned forever ==

One elegant way of chatting is to log in using the 'screen' utility of a Unix system
and, when you shut down the machine, detaching.  This lets you come back to the
same session later, as if you had been there all the time.
