The Council of the EU has found a new formula for distribution of power between the member state governments in the Council and thereby removed one of the last obstacles to the adoption of the EU Constitution.

The last obstacle could be plebiscites in some countries such as UK and Denmark.

In discussions within FFII about the constitution, the following points of criticism have been raised:

 1. The constitution perpetuates the current undemocratic system of the EU, wherein legislative power is wielded mainly by the Executive.  It cements the EU as a "Union of Councils", i.e. a consiliar (soviet) union, where much of the legislative process takes place in the dark without supervision by any parliament (--> [[EuKonstitCons04Fr| further analysis]]).
 1. The constitutions says "Intellectual property shall be protected".  This is bad legislation, because the concept of "intellectual property" is unclear and wide open to abusive definitions.  It is primarily the interests, especially freedom interests, of citizens that deserve "protection", inter alia against abusive "intellectual property" claims (--> [[EuKonstitProp04Fr| further analysis]]). 
 1. Some parts of the constitution seem to lock Europe even further into worldwide "IP" treaties and unelected organisms which add extreme interpretations to these treaties (--> [[EuKonstitMond04Fr| further analysis]]).

Further analysis is under preparation.
