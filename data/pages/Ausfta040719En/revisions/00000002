Peter Urban, Australia's consul-general to the US from 1989 to 1994
and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's chief economist in
1995 and 1996, writes that the USA do not want a true Free Trade
Agreement with Australia, because "a free trade agreement with
Australia is not in their national interest".  One way in which the US
has sought to turn the currently negotiated "AUSFTA" (australia us
free trade agreement) to the advantage of the USA has been to
incorporate demands that Australia must allow extensive patenting and
patent enforcement in the software field.  Urban warns:

  The US has been pursuing its IP trade agenda quite single-mindedly for
  more than the last decade. In the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations,
  for example, the US threatened to block final agreement unless all
  parties agreed to an extension to the life of patent protection.

  ...

  Reinforcing this is the fact that the US has a culture of aggressive
  use of patents (and patent enforcement) and the US patent office is
  granting very broad patents (for example, on double clicking) for IT.

  The result - the US government and US industry are looking to trying
  to use IP protection as a major element in their strategy to protect
  the position of the United States as a major economic power.
