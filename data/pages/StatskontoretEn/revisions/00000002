Fulfillment of the conditions in PatL §1.

The invention as stated in the patent is only describing a flow of
information between different cooperating entities. Each partaking
unit is well known. The claim is that the described flow of
information is somehow a solution to one or more technical
problems. The solution provided gives no new technical solutions with
regard to how a database works, how to create a form, how to connect
units with each other, in which way computer files can encompass
different formats or what these formats would mean, how a file
includes indentification of a reciever, how means for transaction and
reception work, or how encryption and signing work. It's only
indicated that these features exist but none of them advance the
technical state of the art. The description refers only to known
conventional means and methods to accomplish the invention. The
combination in itself does not lift the invention to any technical
level. The inventions thus subsists solely of an administrative method
to submit a form. No technical features whatsoever are
presented in the patent according to the granted claims, which is why
the patent is not considered an invention within the patentable realm
defined in PatL §1.

Demand

As there is no invention in the patentable realm according to PatL paragraph 1, and as there is no novelty, or at least no inventive height, according to PatL paragraph 2 we demand that the patent office revoke the granted patent in its entirety.

In case the patent office can not decide to revoke the granted patent only based on written communication we demand a personal conference with the member who is dealing with the matter in order to thereby orally further explain our position on the matter.

Proof of publication of referenced publications can be sent if required.

We will also discuss (expand on) the (more general) relevancy
of these distinguishing caracteristics.

Patent claim 1 is about (has as subject):
1a: A system for accessing, modifying and transferring computer (data) files
including:
1b: a universal, widely spread network,
1c: a database system,
1d: at least (minimally) a (one) local data processing system (computer),
1e: a notary server (a server providing notary services),
1f: and at least (minimally) a (one) reciever (recieving) system,
1g: which comprise independent systems attached to the network,
1h: where the database system comprises (makes, is a means for)
storing a number(set) of data files,
1i: which each one includes a form,
1j: where each form is in a mainly arbitrary but predetermined format
which can differ from the format of other forms in the database system,
1k: whereby each file includes identification which associates it with
a given reciever(receiving) system,
1l: and the database system becomes the means to transfer data files by
the network to the local data processing system,
1m: whereby each local data processing system becomes the means for using
the database system, for downloading through the network of at least
one user selected data file stored in the database system,
1n: for (the purpose of) registering changes introduced by the user
in the downloaded data file,
1o: and for transfer of the modified data file as a transferred data file
to the notary server by way of the network,
1p: and whereby the notary server comprises a means to receive every
transfered data file by way of the network,
1q: and to transfer every transferred data file to the receiver system by
which the transferred data file is associated.

Patent claim 6 is about (has as subject), besides what is meant in patent
claim 1:
6a: a portable memory device which stores personal encryption parameters
for the user, and
6b: a reader that is attached to the local data processing system to
(for the purpose of) reading the users encryption parameters from
the portable memory device,
6c: where every local data processing system also comprises the means
for encryption of transferred data files with use of public(common)
encryption codes, and
6d: to attach to every transfered form a with public code encrypted
digital code which uniquely identifies the user of the receiver system,
with which the transferred form is associated.
