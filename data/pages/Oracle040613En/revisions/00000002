When this patent was filed in March 31, 2000 there where already free PHP/MySQL scripts providing the described functionality. Today there must be thousands of websites using similar systems. 

=== Abstract ===
A web site creation and maintenance system permits distributed control and centralized management of a web site. The physical implementation of the web site resides on a database maintained by a database administrator. The web site system permits a site administrator to construct the overall structure, design and style of the web site. This allows for a comprehensive design as well as a common look and feel for the web site. The web site system permits content for the web site to originate from multiple content contributors. The publication of content is controlled by content owners. This permits assignment of content control to those persons familiar with the content. The web site system is also a self service web site system for content contributors, content owners, and site administrators. The self service system displays to users one or more panels that contain input fields to permit the users to submit content and web site components for publication on the web site. The user, through use of only a web browser running on the user computer, transmits the parameter to the web site database. In response, the web site is updated at the database in accordance with the parameter.

=== Claim 1 ===
A method for displaying content, comprising: 

 * receiving input that defines a set of perspectives, wherein each perspective in the set of perspectives is a cross category grouping of one or more content items, and wherein said one or more content items is in a plurality of content items; 
 * storing, in a database, the plurality of content items, wherein each of the plurality of content items belongs to one or more categories; 
 * receiving user input that associates subsets of said set of perspectives with each of said plurality of content items; and 
 * in response to a request to display a web page that contains one of said plurality of content items, displaying on said web page a selectable control for each perspective in the subset of said set of perspectives that is associated with said one of said plurality of content items.
