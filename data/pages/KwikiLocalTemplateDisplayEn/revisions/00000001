The kwiki local template file display.html determines the structure of a kwiki page.

== News & Chronology ==

 * 2004-10-31 phm simplifies the header, makes sure people can easily log in and find info on acquiring an editor status

== Purpose of the change of 2004-10-31 ==

 * take account of the fact that most kwiki pages are now write-protected
 * take account of the fact that kwiki is no longer mainly and addenda system
 * let new users immediately find out how they can get write access
 * let editors switch to editing mode by 2 or less clicks in the upper left corner 
 * remove addenda-related explanation text: this is still found at the bottom and it the it is now implicit in the title of the addenda pages, which links back to the associated static page.
   * phm previously already shortened this text
   * our system should be minimalistic, as little repetitive text and as large an editing space on the screen as possible 
 * remove possibility of deleting an entire page in the [:KwikiLocalTemplateEditEn: edit template]: this is too easy to do by accident and too easy to abuse.  We normally need to maintain a record of changes of a kwiki file.

== Details about the File Structure ==

The files discussed here are found on [:GenbaEn: genba] in ''var/www/cgi-bin/kwikimj04/local/template''.

== To Do ==

 * incorporate [:DokDateEn: document metadata] in _header.html
