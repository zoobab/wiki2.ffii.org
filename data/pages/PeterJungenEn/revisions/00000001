''Peter Jungen heads the European Enterprise Institute, a think tank in Brussels which, after Jungen had shown a critical attitude toward patent lobby propaganda, suddenly became a PR frontend for the patent lobby in June 2005, shortly before the Parliament's decision on the software patent directive.  Jungen is currently campaigning to become the next president of the SME Union.  Previously Jungen held leading posts in Business Angels Network Deutschland (BAND) and the German Employers' Confederation BDI.''
