116 is better than the Council version, but is overly complex (the inclusion of sensors, circuit breakers etc is no necessary).

117 is a reprise from first reading. 118 is a little better since it says "computer-assisted" instead of "computer-implemented". 33 is quite similar, though a bit more convoluted since it takes on board a lot of Council wordings.

119 = 120 = 121 simplifies the first reading definition by removing the "technical production" wording (this article is only about the form of the claims, not about patentability criteria).
