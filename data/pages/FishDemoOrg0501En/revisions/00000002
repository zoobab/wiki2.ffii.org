 I don't want to discuss whether another banner campaign or web demo is
 good or bad.  Fact is: We don't have much time and we should better get
 started sooner than later.  Here's how to proceed:
 
 1. Contact at least one project.  For example send a mail to the mailing
    list of a project that you have some relation to (e.g. a LINUX tool
    that you use frequently).  Inform the project leaders about the
    events related to the upcoming fisheries council, and try to convince
    these organizations/individuals to
 
    - put a banner on their web site (propose one of the existing banners
      for now [1] - it's uncertain that new banners will be created in
      time), or to
 
    - substitute their home page with a protest page.  An example is the
      FFII home page [2].
 
 2. In e-mails to webcampaign0501<AT>ffii.org, report
 
    - which organizations/individuals you contacted thus far, even if the
      contact hasn't been successful yet.
 
    - which organizations will participate.  In this case also provide
      contact information (e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) of
      webmasters/etc. of the corresponding organizations/individuals if
      possible.  This information will be very valuable for organizing
      future web campaigns.
 
    - your contact information and your FFII UID [3], if you have one at
      hand.
 
    Note that we will replace the email list with a web interface as soon
    as possible, perhaps this night.

 It's important to start contacting organizations immediately, even
 though new banners aren't ready yet!  Once we have contacts we can
 inform them to replace banners.

 By tradition, I'll start with contacting the web master of the FVWM
 project ...

 PS: Please help me translate these instructions into as many languages
 as possible.  I'll do the translation into German.
