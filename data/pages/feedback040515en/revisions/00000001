 we need your help for continued campaigning up to the European Parliament's
 elections of June 10-13 and beyond.

  [ ] Please leave me alone, I don't want to support FFII anymore.
  [ ] I will participate in the urgent fax/mail campaign[4]
  [ ] I want to be in Brussels[6] on monday/tuesday and may need a bed/room. 
  [ ] I am familiar with the "How to Help"[2] and "FFII Projects"[3] pages.
  I am willing to spend [__] hours per week during the EP election campaign
  I am located in country [$LAND] (ISO 3166 code).

== Anonymous critique of proposal 1 ==

 * the most important part (calling the governments) is has been removed by sombody not interested in the council - BAD.
 * it's too big now (too many questions and too little information what to do) - it overwhelms people.
 * it mixes two things into one mail:
   * 1st, the urgent part(council)
   * 2nd the long term part


== Critique (J. Heald, 3.30pm CET) ==

1. If a link is vitally important, include it in-line.  Otherwise summarise it or cut it.  I don't believe anybody reads footnotes in emails.

2. The important thing is to be telling supporters EXACTLY, step-by-step, point-by-point what you want them to do, and what you want them to say, and very clear.   

3. Do '''NOT''' make the email look like a junk-mail market research questionnaire.  What people (may) want to receive is a situation report; and clear instructions. 

But making the email look like a junk-mail questionnaire positively pisses people off.  That's why the return rates have been derisory.

Tell people what they can do as if you were speaking to them.  The main body of the email should stand by itself, and properly explain all the options.  Include a tear-off feedback box if you wish, but only '''after''' and '''separate to''' the main body of the email.

4.  Move "please leave me alone" to the last item in the feedback box, not the first.

5.  The letters you're offering for people to send need quite a lot of work.  It's important the letters should be all different - '''not''' a form letter - and rooted in people's own personal situation, and concerns.

 


== Proposal 2 (idea of bk, but being constantly changed...) ==

Proposal:

 * Split it into two short, focused mails
   * one for the council - call the covernments
   * one for the election, with the results(we should give them anyway) - on tues/wednesday, when the aktiv form is finished
