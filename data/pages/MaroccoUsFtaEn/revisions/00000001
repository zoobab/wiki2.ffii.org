From: http://www.buyusa.gov/morocco/en/33.html :

"The FTA also requires Morocco to provide a high level of IPR protection, consistent with U.S. law, including state-of-the-art protections for trademarks and digital copyrights, as well as expanded protection for patents and product approval information."
