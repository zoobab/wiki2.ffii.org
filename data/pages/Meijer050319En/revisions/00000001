''19 March 2005 -- Erik Meijer MEP (GUE/NGL) has asked the Council for thorough clarifications regarding the way it reached its "Common Position" on the software patents directive on 7 March 2005. His questions are based on the list sent earlier to the Council's legal services by the FFII. This action underwrites the importance for a quick and serious answer by the Council to these concerns.''

The FFII welcomes this initiative and hopes more parliamentarians, also from national parliaments, will stress the need for clear and unambiguous answers to these [:LtrFfiiCons050308En: important questions]. Europe needs a Council of Ministers which can be held accountable for the decisions it takes, and the single most important means to guarantee this is transparency of procedures and sessions.

=== Jonas Maebe ===

According to rule 3.8 of the [:ConsRegl0412En: Council's Rules of Procedure], an A item (a formal point) must be removed from the agenda if it ''might'' lead to further discussions. With 3 governments, 4 national Parliaments and the European Parliament explicitly asking for renewed discussions, as well as unilateral statements of concerns from 9 different member states, we think that this condition was fulfilled.

There is one caveat however: the A item must be removed (and can be reinstated as a "B item" or discussion point), ''"unless the Council decides otherwise"''. One of the questions referred to above asks how the Council decided otherwise, since no such decision was apparent during the public deliberations. It is now up to the Council to rectify the situation. Or, to sum it up:

'''This is not a Banana Union,''' */unless the Council decides otherwise./*
