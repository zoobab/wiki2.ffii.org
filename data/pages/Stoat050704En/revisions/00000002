''The London-based patent attorney Nigel Stoate, partner from the law firm Taylor-Wessing has clarfied what the software-patent directive is about. Taylor-Wessing is the law firm that also has'' [[http:KlausHeinerLehneEn|Klaus-Heiner Lehne MEP]] ''listed as one of their partners. Lehne is called head of "Regulatory Affairs" and was hired together with his parliamentary assistant Haak in September 2003 for lobbying consulting for clients of Taylor Wessing, a multi-national law firm specialising on patent litigation for IP-rich corporations.''

In the [[http://www.smh.com.au/news/next/patently-absurd/2005/07/04/1120329359129.html?oneclick=true|Sydney Morning Herald]] Nigel Stoate is quoted saying:

  Nigel Stoate, a patent attorney with London firm Taylor Wessing,
  says the directive leaves the status quo mostly unchanged. About
  30,000 software patents are granted by the European Patent
  Office and the scope of patentability will not be significantly
  widened. Mr Stoate says the directive removes inconsistencies
  in granting software patents across the EU's jurisdictions.

  "Europe recognises that patenting software is important to keep
   up with the US, and the new directive achieves this," Mr Stoate
   says. "The new directive is intended to harmonise the position
   across all the member states."

[[http://www.taylorwessing.com/about_us/nigel_stoate.html|Nigel Stoate]] is a Taylor-Wessing partner for "Intellectual Property", so he knows what he is talking about. One can only wonder why Mr. Lehne keeps on pushing the fairy tale that the directive is '''not''' about patenting software "as such". It seems that at least one partner from his law-firm has understood what the directive is about.

Stoate is also [[http://www.bi.les-europe.org/news/78.htm#7a|member of LES]] which lobbied for "The Patentability of Software-related Business Methods" in Ireland.
