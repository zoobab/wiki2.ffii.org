Ulrich Kaiser and Thomas Rønde, two Danish economists, explain the
situation in Europe and Denmark concerning software patents after the
decision of the European Parliament of September 2003 and review some
of the economic literature on patents.  The study was funded by the
Danish Ministry of Economy.  There is no date on the paper, but we
guess that it was published in 2004.

[[AndreRebentischDe| Andre]] commented on a mailing list:

The reasoning is a little bit weak from methodological point of view
but it is worth a read. A scientific literature based approach and
clueless authors with some innovative ideas.

Some contributions of the authors are very silly, e.g. page 15
"Division of labour between copyright and patents where only the very
novel inventions are protected by patent laws and all other inventions
are protected by copyrights.

However they try to discuss the issue unbiased and provide the usual
result.  - patents less likely beneficial for dk than the US But the
argument is here a "free ride": "since Denmark lacks a significant
software industry"

They quote many players including Lutterbeck, Horns and Smets-solanes.

=== Hartmut Pilch ===

The paper tells the story of the patent directive and outlines much of
the theoretical economic thinking on patents but, like many
economists' papers, takes the governmental (patent office) rationale
about the proposed patenting rules (e.g. "US patents software as such,
we patent only inventions with a technical contribution") at face
value and fails to look at the relation between such rules and the
resulting patents.  It only examines the relation between patents (as
abstract entities in a fairly crude model) and economic output.  Here
it applies the usual critical wisdom of economists about the upsides
and downsides of monopoly rights as instruments for securing return on
innovation investments.

With a central link in the causal chain between legislation and
economic effects missing, the study is unable to deliver on its
promise of investigating the economic effects of legislatve proposals.

Hopefully it is considered as an economic study. I would entitled it as a litterature review. Where are the modelling equations?
