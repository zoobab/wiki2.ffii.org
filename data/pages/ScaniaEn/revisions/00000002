''The Swedish truck company Scania does not own many patents, especially not in the software field.  However, in view of the growing importance of the patent system and the monopolisation possibilities which it offers to Scania and its competitors, Scania hired a patent lawyer Fredrik Egrelius with the task of promoting software patenting within the company.  Egrelius subsequently became a lobbyist who promoted software patentability in Stockholm and Brussels in the name of Scania and the (Swedish) automobile industry.''
