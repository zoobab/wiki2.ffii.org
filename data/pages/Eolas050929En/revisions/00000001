''Microsoft lost in its fight against the "technology company" Eolas. Thats what online media and Eolas Technologies Inc. do report. The validity of the disputed "plugin patent" US 5,838,906 sustains. Due to patent infrignment Microsoft already got judged to pay more than 500 Mio. US$ to the favour of EOLAS, but as it first seemed was able to take successful steps on an unconventional law process. Already after the first EOLAS finding several standardisation panels (e.g. the W3C) held crisis sessions. Changes in Microsoft products as the IE are potentailly to expect. The "plugin patent" from Eolas is considered to ber very wide and does expand upon key functionalitys of WWW browsers.''

Already on Wednesday the decision has been caried out that Patent [http://164.195.100.11/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1='5838906'.WKU.&OS=PN/5838906&RS=PN/5838906 US 5,838,906: Distributed hypermedia method for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document]
will be held up. By now it is unclear if the case is finally closed with that. The presentation of the University of California (which is the parent company of Eolas) does suggest this:

 The University of California's patent for Web-browser 
 technology essential to the Internet was reaffirmed 
 this week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 
 when it published its notice that the office has 
 completed its re-examination process and will issue a
 re-examination certificate of the patent first 
 challenged by Microsoft Corp. two years ago.

 Bad news for the internet.
 Microsoft failed to prevent the worst case scenario. 
 The USPTO lost its face.
 
 I would like to remind you of EVP representative J. Würmeling. 
 He hinted in his standard reply towards worried European
 citizens for EOLAS and did glorify that company as a
 successful small business that succeeds with software
 patents against the company Microsoft which is often
 blamed as "industry beast". Such sort of sympathy 
 is alien to the experts. There is big worry.

 Several notorious optimists did project in a first
 reaction in our IRC channel a collapse of the
 much discussed US practice for software patents:

 "well, now I can go to sleep and have nice dreams 
 after this good news :) hope the sw patent system 
 will collapse"

 A bad awakening cannot be excluded.
