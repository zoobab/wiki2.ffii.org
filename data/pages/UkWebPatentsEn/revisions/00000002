Some results of a search for web and browser related patents granted by the UK patent office. Note that where patents are marked (A) only original patent applications ("A" documents) are available online. In those cases, the claims of the final "B" versions may be narrower than the ones we have summarised below. As of 2005-01-12 the status of all patents is "PATENT IN FORCE".
