''5 April 2005 -- The UK Patent Office is organising workshops to have people evaluate various definitions for the term "technical contribution". Below, you can find a report from someone attending the workshop in Glasgow.''

== Report ==

by Geraint Bevan.

=== Introduction ===

The meeting was chaired by Roger Walker, a chemist/bio-technologist of
the Patent Office. Peter Hayward of the Patent Office was also present
along with a couple of assistants. Attendance was poor -- 16 people,
which appeared to be just over half of those expected.

As with previous workshops, there was roughly a 50:50 split between
pro and anti software patent people. 550 people in total have
expressed an interest in attending the workshops around the UK -- all
were invited. We were assured that there were no secret patent office
staff among the attendees!

Roger Walker introduced the workshop, saying that the government's
aims were to maintain the current balance: pure software is not
patentable; computer-implemented inventions are. The government is
keen to encourage European high-tech industry -- Nokia was mentioned
as an example.

We were told that there is currently no definition of "technical
contribution", it has arisen as a result of jurisprudence.

As with previous workshops, we were given 4 definitions of "technical
contribution", against which we were to assess 5 case studies,
hypothetical inventions which we were to assume were novel and
non-obvious.  We were divided into 4 tables for this exercise and
invited to decide whether or not the cases were patentable under each
definition. We were urged to try to reach a consensus, but it was not
essential.


=== Cases ===

The hypothetical inventions were:

 * Case 1: Control of traffic lights to optimise traffic flow.
 * Case 8: Centralised printing services (including billing) for a hotel
 * Case 12: A method for predicting moves in an online game
 * Case 13: A method of allocating cell-phone bandwidth according to demand
 * Case 18: Data structure to improve the efficiency of spreadsheet recalculation

The definitions were the current council text, the FFII text and two
definitions drawn from a pool of twenty selected from over 200
suggestions.


=== Definitions ===

==== Definition A (council text) ====

 "Technical Contribution" means a contribution to the state of the art
  in a field of technology which is new and not obvious to a person
  skilled in the art. The technical contribution shall be assessed by
  consideration of the state of the art and the scope of the patent
  claim considered as a whole, which must comprise technical features,
  irrespective of whether or not these are accompanied by non-technical
  features.
==== Definition B (FFII text) ====

 "Technical Contribution" means a contribution made by a claimed
  invention, considered as a whole, to the state of the art in a field
  of technology. "Technical" means belonging to a field of technology.

  New teaching about the use of controllable forces of nature under the
  control of a computer program, beyond the implementation of the data
  processing itself, is technical. The processing, handling,
  representation and presentation of information by a computer program
  is not technical, even where technical devices are employed for such
  purposes.
==== Definition F ====

 "A technical contribution should make a substantial, non-obvious
  advance to the state of the art of knowledge in a technical field, and
  should not be representable as pure logic."
==== Definition H ====

 "A technical contribution is an addition to the general understanding
  of, or art of, the technological control of physical processes. A
  technical contribution may be expressed in computer software of other
  kind of algorithm, but it is not 'technical' simply by virtue of being
  thus expressed."
=== General results ===

For many combinations of case and definition, a consensus was not
reached by each table. After an hour, votes for the patentability or
non-patentability of each permutation were recorded. The overall
summary of the results was that:

 * Definition A led to many question marks, i.e. a decision about the patentability or otherwise of a case could not be made;
 * definition B gave fairly consistent results across the groups;
 * definition F was fairly inconsistent;
 * definition H was fairly consistent except for case 8.

The general trends were that definition A tended to make everything
patentable; B tended to make everything non-patentable; F and H were
mixed but with a tendency towards non-patentability.

=== Results at my table (4) ===

||  Case || A || B || F || H || Subject ||
|| #1 || NNN? || NNNN || YYYN || YYYY || Traffic light control ||
|| #8 || YNN? || NNNN || YYNN || NNNN || Hotel print service ||
|| #12 || YNN? || YNNN || NNNN || YNNN || Online game prediction ||
|| #13 || YYN? || YNNN || NNNN || YNNN || Cell bandwidth allocation ||
|| #18 || NNN? || NNNN || NNNN || NNNN || Spreadsheet data structure ||

 * Y: Case is patentable using the definition
 * N: Case is not patentable using the definition
 * ?: The definition cannot decide the patentability of the case


=== Comments (by table) ===

Each table then gave comments about how easy they found the
definitions to apply and which they preferred.

Table 1 was split with some preferring definition A and some
preferring B. Those who liked A welcomed the fact that it allowed
pretty much anything to be patented. As one patent lawyer said, he
liked it because it lets stuff through the technical barrier leaving
assessment to the novel and non-obviousness tests. Those who preferred
B liked the fact that it did not make everything patentable. This
table commented that they didn't like the phrase "pure logic" in
definition F.

Table 2 had a couple of people who preferred definition A. They didn't
like the other definitions because they led to arguments over
interpretation.

Table 4 (mine) were unhappy with all of the definitions. We found A to
be a circular definition which was not capable of defining anything
unless the phrases "technical features" and "field of technology" were
also defined. We were unanimous in reluctantly preferring B as the
best of a bad bunch.

Table 5 also found A to be circular, noting that it restricted nothing
and was the closest to the European position. For definition B, they
questioned whether "a field of technology" restricted inventions to a
single field or allowed inventions to cross several fields. Peter
Hayward assured them that from a legal perspective, "a field" would
allow inventions to cross several fields.

They also questioned
precisely what intermediate steps would be permitted in the control of
forces of nature. The phrase "forces of nature" was generally liked
and understood to relate to physical things. There was some
unhappiness with definition F because it would go beyond the scope of
the directive and also exclude pure mathematics (!!! there were patent
lawyers there !!!). They thought that H gave the widest possible
definition.


=== Voting ===

We were then asked whether or not we thought that each of the cases
should be patentable, regardless of definition.

 * Case  1: 11 patentable,  5 non-patentable
 * Case  8:  3 patentable, 13 non-patentable
 * Case 12:  5 patentable, 11 non-patentable
 * Case 13: 15 patentable,  1 non-patentable
 * Case 18:  6 patentable, 10 non-patentable

We were also asked whether or not we thought pure software should be
patentable

 * Pure software: 7 patentable, 6 non-patentable

A straw poll, after some people had left, was also held to ascertain
whether we believed that the current directive achieves the
government's stated aims:
 * 7 no, it doesn't; 0 yes, it does; 2 abstentions


=== What next? ===

The outcomes of each workshop will be collated and presented to Lord
Sainsbury along with the Patent Office's recommendations after the
final sessions on Friday. All of the definitions and case studies will
then be published on a web site. The outcome of the sessions will also
be made available, but not until the minister has had a chance to see
them. It was noted that the general election may prevent disclosure
for a while.

The raw data from which the collated results are obtained will
probably not be published on a web site because they would not make
much sense to people who did not attend the workshops, but we were
assured that they would be available to those who desired to see them
to check that the reported outcomes are justified by the data.


=== Further comments ===

After further discussions with the Patent Office staff, there were two
comments that are worthy of particular note. Firstly, the UK
government delegates decisions on UK patent policy to the patent
office, i.e. it is not the case that the patent office merely
implements the government's wishes; it also decides what those wishes
are.

''Editor's note:'' Peter Hayward from the UKPO, who is UKPO staff member referred to above, provided the following clarification regarding what he said:

 "What I explained at Glasgow was that in some European countries policy
  on intellectual property is handled by officials in Justice Departments
  and in others (including the UK) it is handled by officials in Patent
  Offices.  That does not mean that Patent Office officials like myself
  decide policy, any more than officials in Justice Departments decide
  policy.  Policy is decided by Ministers, as Steve Probert has already
  rightly stressed.

  Just to be complete, I suppose I should have mentioned that in yet
  other countries the policy is handled by officials in general Trade
  Departments.  There are pros and cons of all the options."

Secondly, when discussing the impact of software patents on
open-source software, we were told that many leading open-source
developers did not think that there would be any adverse impact,
including people from FFII. Unfortunately, Peter Hayward would not
tell us which leading open source developer in FFII made such
comments. This matter should certainly be pursued as it is quite
likely that comments taken out of context are being used to
misrepresent FFII opinion (perhaps unintentionally).
