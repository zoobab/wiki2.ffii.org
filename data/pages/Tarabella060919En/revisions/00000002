=== Answer ===

  E-3525/06EN
  Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission
  (19.9.2006)

  The Commission is currently in the process of examining the issue of the
  draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) and the possibility of
  moving the project forward in the context of its consultation on the
  future patent policy in Europe. The consultation was launched on 16
  January 2006 and proved to be a huge success, generating over 2Â 500
  answers from interested circles. A public hearing took place on 12 July
  2006. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the responses and
  drawing its conclusions. Naturally, the Parliament will be informed about
  the Commission's findings and recommendations as soon as they have been
  finalized.

  The question as to whether, under the draft EPLA, judges from the
  Technical Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office could be
  candidates for the European Patent Judiciary is a question that would
  form part of the EPLA negotiations. The Community is not a party to the
  negotiations and can therefore not comment on this issue.
