''Some companies are facing litigation from the MPEG patent cartel MPEG-LA.  There will most likely be opportunities for intervention in invalidation procedings in national courts or in competition procedings before the European Commission.  At the same time, various FOSS multimedia players are currently hindered from circulation by patent thickets.  We need to bring the interested experts together and prepare material that can be used for amicus curiae letters.''
