The patent office administrators (such as UKPO) assembled in the
Council Working Party appear to be winning a Pyrrhic victory. They are
greatly helping to mobilise and broaden the resistance against their
own institutions. More and more people are becoming aware that a
regime like copyright, with a narrow exclusion scope and no written
claims, is better adapted not only to software but also to other
fields of present-day innovation.  Between the computerised logics and the laws of nature, the
space for meaningful patenting seems to be becoming thinner.  There
seems to be a sense of crisis in the leading circles of the patent
system, to which they are reacting by single-minded expansionism and
reckless political manoevres, shrouded in a transparent veil of Orwellian Patent Newspeak.  The European Parliament presented them
a great chance to stabilise their system, and they are not only losing
this chance but also putting themselves into an untenable position.  The process of deepening dysfunctionality and eventual collapse which we saw in the soviet empire 20 years ago can be observed in the patent system today.  Btw, "Soviet" is the Russian word for "Council".
