Only software solutions (programs for computers) are computer-implemented.
Programs for computers are however not inventions in the sense of Art 52 of the European Patent Convention.

The much-cited "anti-blocking system" or "computer-controlled washing machine" solutions are not "computer-implemented" but rather "brake-implemented" or "mechanics-and-detergent-implemented".  They can however be "computer-aided".

The EPO and Commission chose the word "computer-implemented" on purpose, with a clear definition.  Do not be confused!  The objective of their directive project is not to affirm the patentability of "computer-aided inventions" but to make "computer-implemented" solutions patentable.
