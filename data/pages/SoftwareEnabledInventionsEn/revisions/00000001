== Quotes  ==

 In our digital era, computer-implemented, or software-enabled,
 inventions are at the heart of all digital technology and are a very
 significant force behind innovation in Europe in so many industry
 sectors, covering healthcare, telecommunications, mobile phones, cars,
 aviation and consumer electronics.

---> SEI as another word for CII, as another word for Swpat?

 Elimination of the patentability of software-enabled inventions in Europe
 would severely damage European industry, because these inventions cover 
 more than 2/3 of the existing patent portfolio.
