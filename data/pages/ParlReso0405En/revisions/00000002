=== Demand ===

We request the Government to support the position of the European Parliament, expressed in its vote of 24 September 2003, on the limits of patentability with respect to software and business methods in connection with the proposed directive COM 2002/0047 (COD), and to reject the counter-proposals which have been worked out by a group of national patent administrators ("Working Party on Intellectual Property (Patents)") in the Council of Ministers of the EU since then.  We moreover urge our government to actively promote this position in the EU.

=== Reasoning  ===

The proposal of the European Commission from February 2002 showed serious deficiencies.  Essentially, it was designed to legitimate a controversial practice of the European Patent Office (EPO), on whose base in the last years more than 30000 broad and trivial patents on algorithms and business methods have been granted against the letter and spirit of the written law, mostly to non-European companies, with practically no applicants from the Czech Republic.

According to TRIPs Article 10 and European Patent Convention Art 52, software is to be protected by the rules of copyright.  This means that not general ideas but individual implementations can become an individual's "intellectual property."  This model of property in software has served the industry well and there is no economic study that indicates that property of ideas (algorithms), as are typically the object of patents in this field, is anything but disruptive to the national economy. 

The measures taken by the European Parliament in its plenary vote of September 2003 and upon recommendation of the Culture and Industry committees are essentially the very steps necessary to correct the mistaken trend in the patent practice with regard to software and business methods: 

 1. Definition of the key terms "technology" and "industry", mentioned in TRIPs Article 27, by references to matter and forces of nature.
 1. Clarification that data processing is not a "field of technology" in the sense of TRIPs Article 27.
 1. Clarification that the engineering achievement which the patent rewards (and not just a virtual construction owed to clever claim drafting by a patent attorney) has to be of technical nature.
 1. Redefinition of the misleading term "computer-implemented inventions" so that it refers to inventions in the sense of patent law (contributions to the progress of applied natural science) and not to "computer-implemented" algorithms and business methods.
 1. Safeguard of the right of interoperation (Article 6a).
 1. Affirmation of the freedom of publication (Article 5A), a human right according to Article 10 of ECHR, that may be limited by copyright but not by patent law. 

While the European Parliament essentially achieved the stated goals of the directive, the executive bodies have failed to do their homework.

The Council's Patent Working Group does not offer any serious analysis of economic goals that are supposed to be pursued and why these goals are better reached with the "compromise document" than with the Parliament's draft.  

We hold it an inadmissible assault on democracy to dismiss the work of the elected legislators in this way.
