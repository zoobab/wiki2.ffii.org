===== Brief Summary  =====

Sivasankar started  the discussion  with the difficulties  involved in
testing "program equivalence", giving two short programs, based on the
Goldbach conjecture, calling  one as the goldbach (about  7 lines) and
the  other the ghost_of_goldbach  (about 3  lines that  always returns
true). Testing  program equivalence is  at the heart of  any "software
patent" infringement suit, and Shiv  proved that it is well impossible
to scientifically  research and conclude  that two given  programs are
equivalent.  There are not  even any standard rules for scientifically
testing and concluding "program equivalence".

Sivasankar holds  a B.Tech. from  the Indian Institute  of Technology,
Madras, and has  done M.E.  in Computer Science,  at !IISc., Bangalore.
He  has worked  for IBM,  USA., and  has presented  several  papers on
computer  science, and software  development.  Well,  he is  a typical
expert  who  may   be  called  to  testify  in   a  "software  patent"
infringement suit, to "prove"  that a given computer program infringes
upon a  given "software  patent".  It is  apparent that no  expert can
assert on  oath that two  programs are "equivalent"  or that one  is a
copy of the other, except when the two are exact copies.

Murali discussed the various business models used by software entities to do business.

Ramanraj basically summarised the recent events that has mostly been discussed at in-parl mailing list; and to enliven the proceedings; took the audience through the recent decision pronounced in Eolas v. Microsoft, to explain how the system works in the US, and asked those present to explore and research the steps that could be taken against the illegitimate practice of "software patents" which are a barrier against free trade.

==== About the Workshop: ====

The Department of Legal Studies, University of Madras, is organising a
workshop on "TRIPS Treaty  and Computer Programs", that is tentatively
scheduled  for 8th  April, 2005  (Friday).   The one  day workshop  is
intended as  an "out-reach  programme" for software  professionals and
students specialising in international law.

The  legal aspects  of Computer  Programs  are governed  by the  TRIPS
Treaty.   Globalisation, governance, and  almost every  human activity
hinges upon Computer Programs and its legal setting. The workshop will
discuss the  true nature  of computer programs,  and the  character of
rights surrounding them.  The harm caused by mis-application of patent
law  to cover computer  programs in  some member  states of  the TRIPS
Treaty, notably US  and Japan, and the possible  remedies against such
practices, will also be analysed threadbare.
