The horizontal lines in this page are made with 4 or more dashes:

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

  '''_Combination of bold and underscore_'''
''*_Combination of bold, italics, and underscore_*''
  ''*_Combination of bold, italics, and underscore_*''

These "bold, italics and underscore" text attributes are rendered invalid by 
separating them through line breaks, i.e. insertion of CR (carriage return); 
in other words, they are valid only within a single line.

Inline code like [=/etc/passwd] or [=CGI::Kwiki]

Any text that does not begin in the first column is rendered as preformatted 
(or plain i.e. NOT using format rules) text.

Please make sure that you do use enough line breaks, else you will get a really long line that might lead to inlined horizontal scrollbars.

You can comment out wiki-text with '#' at the beginning of a line. This will make the text an html comment:
## These lines have been 
## commented out
  # These lines have been
  # commented out
## -*- This line is a comment!  -*-
  # -*- This line is a comment!  -*-
----
WikiLinks are formed by two or more words in ''camel-case'', whereby
''camel case'' designates words created by smashing together capitalized words:
!PeopleConsiderThisAnExample.

If sometimes camel-case words !ShouldNotMakeAWikiLink then put '!' before it (see above!).

Forced wiki [links] are an alphanumeric string surrounded by square brackets.
  Forced wiki [links] are an alphanumeric string surrounded by square brackets.
Remark: "pink" color and question mark appear because of the NON-existence (i.e. having NO content) of the linked page!
----
Internal named WikiLinks are enclosed in square brackets, beginning with or surrounded by linkname, followed by !http:? and its !WikiLink name, such as [[ThisIsAnInternalLink Link| Named Internal]]. BTW http:? is always referring to the root directory of the Wiki site. Try a click!

External unnamed (http) links begin with http://, like http://www.freepan.org.

  External named (http) links have text enclosed in square brackets with an http:// link inside,
  like [[http://www.freepan.org|Site FreePAN]].
----
External nested links with multiple internal http:// references inside their URL shall NOT use ASCII-characters but ASCII-codes instead for all but the first "://" expression, i.e !URLs like [[http://www.example.info/.../gf_call.jsp?SiteID=1&url=http://mail.example.info|EXAMPLE]], here incorrectly written as 
  [[http://www.example.info/.../gf_call.jsp?SiteID=1&url=http://mail.example.info|EXAMPLE]]
(the last part of said URL => "http://mail.example.info" is missing here, i.e. is NOT shown! - BUT, to make it clear: besides the word EXAMPLE the whole URL-stuff shouldn't show up, it is only viewable as an arte fact because of a misinterpretation of the formatting rules for multiple "http://" terms) - therefore these "://" expressions have thus to be written as "%3A%2F%2F" within all following (but the first, which is needed) http:// designations - e.g. (a correctly formed example link only, which is NOT functional however!)
  [[http://www.example.info/.../gf_call.jsp?SiteID=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.example.info|EXAMPLE]].
resulting in this correctly formatted "named http link": [[http://www.example.info/.../gf_call.jsp?SiteID=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.example.info|EXAMPLE]].

If sometimes internal or external links should not link, like !http:?!FooBarCom or !http://foobar.com, then put '!' before it.

Links to images display the image:

{{http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif}}
  {{http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif}}

User question: ''Can I put a link behind the image (make the image a link)? phpwiki can do this easily.''
''I have tried a few combinations (named links, HTML) and failed to get the desired result.''

Answer:
HTML cannot work because < and > are internally converted to "& lt ;" and "& gt ;" metas.

Mailto links are just email addresses like foo@bar.com. The mailto: is automagically added.

Dotted lists (also named Unordered lists) begin with '*' (asterisk):
 
 * foo
 * bar
   * boom
   * bam
 * baz

The number of asterisks determines the level!
  * foo
  * bar
  ** boom
  ** bam
  * baz
----
Numbered lists (also named Ordered lists) begin with '0' (zero):

 1. foo
 1. bar
00 boom
00 bam
 1. baz
  0 foo
  0 bar
  00 boom
  00 bam
  0 baz
----
Dotted and Numbered lists can also be mixed:
 * Today:
00 Eat ice cream
00 Buy a pony
 * Tomorrow:
00 Eat more ice cream
00 Buy another pony
  * Today:
  00 Eat ice cream
  00 Buy a pony
  * Tomorrow:
  00 Eat more ice cream
  00 Buy another pony
Sample with mixing reverted:
 1. Today:
   * Eat ice cream
   * Buy a pony
 1. Tomorrow:
   * Eat more ice cream
   * Buy another pony
  0 Today:
  ** Eat ice cream
  ** Buy a pony
  0 Tomorrow:
  ** Eat more ice cream
  ** Buy another pony

Simple Tables:

using condensed writing:
||  || Dick || Jane ||
|| height || 72" || 65" ||
|| weight || 130lbs || 150lbs ||
  ||Dick|Jane|
  |height|72"|65"|
  |weight|130lbs|150lbs|

using wide writing:
|        | Dick   | Jane |
| height | 72"    | 65"  |
| weight | 130lbs | 150lbs |
  |        | Dick   | Jane |
  | height | 72"    | 65"  |
  | weight | 130lbs | 150lbs |
As you can see, there is no difference in result so it is up to you how the source gets designed. The wiki always uses a font with a fixed character width for the text in the table.
----
Tables with multiline or complex data:
| <<END | <<END |
This data has vertical | bars |
END
## This is some Perl code:
sub foo {
    print "I want a kwiki!\n"
}
END
| foo | <<MSG |
As you can see we use
the Perl heredoc syntax.
MSG
  | <<END | <<END |
  This data has vertical | bars |
  END
  # This is some Perl code:
  sub foo {
      print "I want a kwiki!\n"
  }
  END
  | foo | <<MSG |
  As you can see we use
  the Perl heredoc syntax.
  MSG
As you can see the multiline members will get emphasized as if they were encoded with the Preformatted Text method (see above!). 

For people that arent that familiar with Perl or similar, here is a more detailed explanation.
The basic table structure is this:
  | <<END | <<END |
  | foo | <<MSG |
It is a 2x2 matrix with the word "foo" in the lower left part.

In the other parts you will find three free form keywords that do start with the characters "<<". In order of appearence on the line there has to be the body text for this field of the table. The end of each body text is marked with the formerly used keyword on the beginning of a single line.

The content for the upper left field is therefore specified by:
  This data has vertical | bars |
  END
The content for the upper right field is therefore specified by:
  # This is some Perl code:
  sub foo {
      print "I want a kwiki!\n"
  }
The content for the lower right field is therefore specified by:
  As you can see we use
  the Perl heredoc syntax.
  MSG
