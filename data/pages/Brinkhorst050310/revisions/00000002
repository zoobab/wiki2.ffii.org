[[http://www.webwereld.nl/|WebWereld]] reports that the decision about softwarepatents has possibly been made beforehand.

 
The [[http://www.webwereld.nl/nieuws/20998.phtml|article]] quotes Brinkhorst:

''"I can only guess about the motives Denmark had to make it clear, before the [[start |of the]] Council already, that it would not insist on a B-item"''

Which seems to originate from the [[http://www.tweedekamer.nl/images/stenogram3_tcm22-44906.doc|stenographic report]] on the site of the Dutch Parliament about Tuesdays debate.

The interesting part however, is that it also mentions that the Ministry of Economic affairs confirmed there has been a dinner:

''The Ministry of Economic affairs would not consider it strange if there had been discussion beforehand. "It is quite possible that in the context of the dinner there has been a discussion, but I do not know" says spokesperson Paula de Jonge. She cannot say if Minister Brinkhorst has taken part in it and does not want to check it. The spokesperson of the Luxembourg Council President did not react to repeated request for comments.''
