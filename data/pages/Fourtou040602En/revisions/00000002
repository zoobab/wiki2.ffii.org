The rapporteur of the EU Directive on the Enforcement of Intellectual
Property Rights, Janelly Fourtou (UDF, Conservative, France), has earned
millions from business related to Intellectual Property Rights, even while
she was shepherding the report through the European Parliament. As several
newspapers have investigated, Mrs. Fourtou runs a private fund together
with her husband, Jean-Ren√© Fourtou, who is the CEO of Vivendi Universal,
the media giant that is worldwide the biggest holder of intellectual
property rights. In November 2002, this fund acquired transferable bonds
worth 14,5 million Euro, which shall be transferred into Vivendi Universal
shares at preference conditions in 2005. The Fourtou children have,
according to the Financial Times, acquired bonds for an additional 5
million Euro. The Fourtou couple has until now made a computational
surplus of 10 million Euro; their children 3,4 million Euro.

Mr. and Mrs. Fourtou are under investigation in France because there are
allegations that the deal was made in contravention of rules against
insider trading and share price manipulation.

When she filled out the "Declaration of financial interests" every MEP has
to give, Mrs. Fourtou claimed she had 'nothing to declare'. Now the Green
MEP Heide Ruehle complained with the President of the European Parliament,
Pat Cox, saying "Mrs Fourtou should never have been appointed rapporteur".
Any gains from their private fund, the Fourtous say, shall be used for an
artist exchange programme between France and Morocco, where the couple has
a house.

There is an EU corruption investigation Unit [[http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/olaf/|O.L.A.F]] which can investigate such conflicts of interest.

== FFII Comment ==

The IPR Enforcement directive - intended to combat organized crime - was passed on a rush to the EU Parliament this year. It could be very dangerous when applied to our legal system. Its language infringes on certain legal standards. 
The directive covers measures such as '''Anton Piller orders''' (secret court authorisations of raids for evidence by the plaintiff's agents -- Article 8); '''Mareva injunctions''' (freezing of assets, even before a case has been discussed in Court -- Article 10.1); new powers to '''demand the disclosure of very extensive commercial and personal information''' (Article 9);  and the admissibility of '''denounciations by anonymous witnesses as court evidence''' (Article 8.5). 
and Digital Rights Mangement.
