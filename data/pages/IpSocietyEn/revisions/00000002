Dear Intellectual Property Professional:


The Intellectual Property Society ("IP Society") produces events and forums that address the interests and concerns of investors, entrepreneurs, technologists, artists, writers, and other professional and creative workers. Our special mission is to provide an outreach from the intellectual property professions to business, technology and creative communities, as well as the general public.  We aim to enrich the public dialog concerning the role of intellectual property and the common welfare.
