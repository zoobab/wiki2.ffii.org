''3rd March 2005 -- At today's meeting of the Conference of Presidents, the Commissioner for the Internal Market came in place of Commission president Barroso and once again tried without much success to convince the members of the Parliament's groups of the Commission's viewpoint on the software patents directive.''

An insider reported to FFII:

  McCreevy was a unconvincing as in the legal affairs committee on
  02/02.  He was unable to clarify the position of the Commission be it
  on the software patent question itself or why the Council should adopt
  an agreement that ignores the views of both the European Parliament
  and the member states.   

The JURI committee will decide on Monday evening what to do with the
refusal of the European Commission to respond positively to the
restart request of the European Parliament.

McCreevy once again declared that the software patents will be adopted
without vote (as a A-item) on Monday in the competitiveness meeting.
There have meanwhile been conflicting reports about this from the
Council itself.
