According to

the European Patent Office (EPO) is organising a Regional Conference in
Cairo, Egypt, on 7-9 June 2004, with participation mainly from patent office staff
of Arab countries. Most of the panels are about how patent offices should
further cooperate and extend their activities (which by definition serve to "promote
innovation").

The US colleagues of the EPO have also not been inactive in the region:

The EPO has conducted a conference in South Africa in 2003 under
the title "The role of the Industrial Property system in strengthening
the ties between Europe and the region and the economies of developing
countries".

The EPO is also managing a large amount of money from the European Commission designed to "promote innovation" in China.

Perhaps such conferences could also be used for strengthening ties
between the victims of the patent movement in all these countries,
even if these do not have the ressources gained from monopoly fees and taxes.
