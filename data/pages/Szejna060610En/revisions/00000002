  WRITTEN QUESTION P-2615/06
  by Andrzej Szejna (PSE)
  to the Commission
  
  Subject:    Community patent
  
  Taking into consideration the importance of a well-established and
  properly
  functioning patent system for competitiveness, innovation, growth and
  employment in the knowledge-based economy, the problem of the Community
  patent system should be addressed.
  
  After the failure to reach an agreement on the regulation on the
  Community
  patent, the Commission launched a debate dealing with aspects of the
  Community patent system. The consultations were closed on 12 April 2006.
  However, some objections have been raised with regard to the
  availability
  of the form for answers, additionally claiming consultations made in
  such a
  way may be considered invalid.
  
  Is the outcome of the consultation in accordance with the Commission's
  expectations, and does the Commission consider the feedback from the
  stakeholder reliable enough to regard the consultations as binding?
