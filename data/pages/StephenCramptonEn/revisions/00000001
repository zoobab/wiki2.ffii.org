Stephen Crampton has one granted patent and one patent application in gauss:
 * EP[http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1160539 1160 539] "Scanning apparatus and method" claims the principle method of scanning of every laser+camera scanner, granted, opposition window closed
 * EP[http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1194899 1194 899] "Method and apparatus for the generation of computer graphic representations of individuals" is a completely ridiculus patent application which could be better published in a satiric magazine for many reasons. It does not describe a new invention but tries to monopolize all ways of generating 3d models for games using 3d captured position data. The application features 159 claims, of which the last one a good example for all others:

 159. A method of generating data for representing an individual in a computer game
 comprising the steps of:
 generating a computer model of an individual in accordance with any of claims 39-62;
 generating image data of said individual in a plurality of predefined poses,
  wherein said poses comprise poses utilised within a computer game; and
 generating data for representing said individual in said computer game
 utilising said generated image data.

This monopolizes the basic idea of using 3d scanning to generate data for games. This patent application is a whishlist for patent litigaten, it does not represent an invention.
