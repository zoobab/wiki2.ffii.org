''9 March 2005 - Hans-Peter Martin, an independent Austrian MEP, has asked the Council several written questions about the transparency of the Council process. The first time they avoid his question, but after persisting he receives the answer that no sanctions will be taken against people who leak information from confidential Council meetings.''

The President. Question Nr. 12 from '''Hans-Peter Martin''' (H-0143/05)

'''Subject''': Session conducting practice

Almost all Council sessions where decisions are take are closed. Nonetheless, over and over again, Council members publicly communicate details from those sessions in Public.

What sanctions do Council members face for such actions?

What actions does the Council take to obtain maximal transparency, and why aren't many more sessions made public, at least if they concern legislation decisions?

What does the Council answer to the allegations that many of its activities take place using undemocratic processes, decided behind closed doors?

'''Schmit, exercising President of the Council'''. The Council reminds the Honourable Parliamentarian the that every Council member is free to present its position at the press conferences following the Council sessions and to explain elements of the debate which it thinks it should make public to situate the context of its position. The Council is generally does not comment on the public declarations by its members.

Regarding the transparency of the operation of the Council, the Council underlines that, conforming to article 11, paragraph 6, of Annex II of its Rules, the general secretariat of the Council makes public, after the adoption of its decision by te Council in the course of a procedure under Article 251 of the Treaty, or after the definitive adoption of the act concerned, all legislative documents relating to said act, i.e. those which were created before the one of those decisions and which are not covered by any of the exceptions mentioned by Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2 and paragraph 3, second subparagraph, of the Rules 1049/2001.

At the request of the Member State concerned, the documents which are covered by that which preceded the decision, and which reflected the position of the delegation of that Member State, are not made publicly accessible. On the other hand, as long as the negotiations on a draft text go on, the Council reserves the right not to divulge the identity of the delegations when the conditions of Article 4, paragraph 3, of its Rules are met.

Thus, the Council conforms to the letter and the spirit of those official texts, while ensuring a maximum level of transparency.

I hope my presentation was also sufficiently transparent.

Regarding the publication of the votes themselves, the Council reminds the Honourable Parliamentarian that, in the legislative field, those are automatically made public and invites him in that regard to refer to the answers given to a series of written questions in 2003 and 2004 on the same topic.

'''Martin, Hans-Peter (NI)'''. Mr President! Mr. President of the Council, this is very frustrating. You have not answered any of my questions in any way whatsoever. I am not asking you for documents, but am asking you concretely: when you hold a Council meeting, and afterwards someone states "this and that was said". What sanctions do Council members risk in this case? How is dealt with such people?

The two other questions do not relate to the legal situation, of which I am very much aware, but to what you think to actually undertake to counter these reproaches that you are some kind of secrecy organisation. It is also not about what is the legal situation, but about the question: what is concretely intended? I ask you once more, in the interest of general transparency, to actually answer this question: what happens with a minister or a Council member, which says: "this and that has been said in a confidential discussion in a closed session"?

'''Schmit, exercising President of the Council'''. Juridically, there are no sanctions. That is very clear. And we do not intend to introduce any. One cannot at the same time ask for more transparency and to sanction, in fact, the freedom of speech of Council members, even though they, sometimes, misuse this liberty to speak. I cannot see how one could introduction sanctions in this respect.
