After the rejection of CIID, an initiative to legalize a spanish FFII in a discussion at the [http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/es-parl spanish language mailing list].
----

== Monitoring ==

 * 2006-10-7 The board has a meeting in Madrid and decided behind closed doors to boost a Spanish chapter. Recorded in its minutes:

    Authorize a workgroup with mission to represent and organise the
    FFII in Spain. The workgroup will be composed of Alberto, Ivan and
    Pablo.

 * 2006-03-24 For different reasons neither some of the Spanish activists nor the board accept.

 * 2006-03-24 Román Muñoz acepts the proposal of FFII Galiza to coordinate the foundation of FFII at Spain with the majority of the galician group. Suso comunicates it to the eboard.

 * 2006-03-08 After a Joaquim Carvalho mail in es-help asking for the Lisbon meeting with an Alberto reply, Suso informs about the Lisbon meeting in the portuguese list, as President of [http://mesagalega.ffii.org/ FFII Galiza]. Joaquim asked for to create an FFII in Iberia integrating the FFII people from Portugal and from Spain. Alberto backed that idea that matches with its previous proposals of not to impose frontiers: FFII in Spanish, FFII Iberian, FFII Iberoamerican, etc.

 * 2006-02-26 (es-help/ eboard) Hartmut shows in es-help the suport of the board to Alberto, and Suso shows in eboard that neither the constitutional proposal nor Alberto himself had not the support of the spanish people (Alberto: which "Spanish people"? Suso: All in the only one existing group of the FFII in Spain, and the consensual silence in es-help. Alberto: yes, actually, last times in es-help only Suso and Roman speak...). The flame goes to eboard list, and to stop it Pieter Hintjens, President of FFII makes a call to conciliation call proposing a meeting in Lisbon wich will be probably held between April 22th and 23th and to which he will assist together with the other active members of FFII in Spain. '''Both Suso and Alberto accept the meeting proposal in Lisbon'''.

 * 2006-02-21 Suso sends a [http://wiki.ffii.org/FfiiEsConcordiaEs conciliation proposal] from the [http://mesagalega.ffii.org/ galician group] as the result of the meeting at the [http://www.opensourceworldconference.com/malaga06/es/modules/wiwimod/ IIOSWC] between its members and Alberto. Alberto manifest that such a proposal called "of conciliation" doesn't move a milimeter from the original initial position of the Mesa Galega expressed by Suso, and, kindly ask to the Mesa to give an opinion about his proposal of Malaga point by point in a way to know in which ones there is agreement. The galician group of the FFII considers that has no sense to formulate opinions about a proposal tha was repeatedly rejected in es-help and es-parl, specially when it was proposed by '''somebody unauthorized to act as spanish public voice''', when '''it has not reached consensus in the last seven months''', and accepts to involve themselves directly in es-help without the intermediation of Suso. Alberto remembers that such a proposal has been backed by main active members of FFII in Spain in both lists and that '''the strategy of Suso consist in to "kill the messenger instead of the message" and to delay as much as possible the constitution''' of the FFII entity in Spain.

 * 2006-02-17 The meeting between Alberto and members of the galician group happens in the  [http://www.opensourceworldconference.com/malaga06/es/modules/wiwimod/ IIOSWC]: Roberto Brenlla (political partyes coordinator and  Presidente of [http://www.agnix.org/ AGNIX] ), Xabier Seixo (sindical and social movement coordinator and [http://www.glug.es/ Galician Linux Users Groups] member and Carlos Rodríguez (member of [http://www.galpon.org/ GALPON] Grupo de Amigos de Linux de Pontevedra). Alberto proposes the following legal structure: 1) "FFII in Spanish" as an example of name; 2) legal association; 3) no frontiers; 4) democratic: 1 physical member = 1 vote; 5) build by physical entities (persons) and juridic entities (associations and companies); 6) legalized under the existing Spanish law; 7) hosted in any city under such law; 8) with elected representants classified by regional and matter issues. I.e.: Representant/s for Valencia city, representant/s for Valencia province, representant/s for Valencia region, representant/s for Spain, representant/s for Spanish spoken members (all the association), representant/s for companies, representant/s for public administration, etc.; 9) with internal and autonomous working groups if they want to be created.

 * 2006-02-16 Iván Villanueva finds that ''given some disagreements it is possible that the legal formation of FFII in Spain will not be possible during next weeks''. Suso will update the wiki, and will communicate in the global lists the existance of this disagreement wich makes impossible the fundation of the FFII in Spain by the moment.

 * 2006-01-30 a 2006-02-10: intense commonwork where conflicts arose, the creation of a local chapter (perhaps FFII Madrid) is proposed (by Suso only) as a middle term solution, and the sketch of a federal organization with indiviual membership is started.

 * 2006-02-09 a 2006-02-13 (es-help) La puesta en común de es-parl pasa a es-help, surgiendo discrepancias de todo tipo, se propone la creación de un capítulo local (FFII Madrid o similar) y se inicia conjuntamente el esbozo de una organización federal con membresía individual. Suso y Alberto promueven una reunión en el marco de la http://www.opensourceworldconference.com/malaga06/es/modules/wiwimod/ II Conferencia Internacional de Software Libre] entre Alberto y algún miembro del grupo gallego. 

 * 2006-02-08 (es-parl) Jordi Ferrando asks how to /organize ourselves as a legal organization at Spain, even with fees to profesionalize our antiswpts 'lobby'. The proposal is welcommed until the posibility of excluding galician and catalans is proposed. Then Suso says it is posible to any group who wants to federate the spanish FFII, but not valid to the spanish FFII itself, as a ierarchical draft far away the federative consensus. The discusion goes to es-help.

 * 2006-01-30 (es-help) Suso sends the galician valoration about the Alberto proposal. Alberto's proposal caused a great bad feeling at the galician group, since it puts the discusion about organic nature ante the beginning point, before the federative consensus.

 * 2006-01-20 Suso says that both things (to be statal and to be federal) is compatible, and to recicle the working about statutes, he proposes to create a local asociation wich will integrate the Federation later along with the galician chapter. Alberto proposes, to avoid nationalist problems, to constitute an asociation not limited by frontiers representing its members with electronic poll, where they come. He proposes that legal asociation, constituted where we want, is refered (not limited) to the hispano-speaker neigbourhood, iberic, iberoamerican, hispanoamerican, etc. Alberto says that there has no sense federalism limited to the spanish state borders, because then there will be regions/autonomies without representation by its few population.

 * 2006-01-19 Pablo sends a statuts models of the kind of an asociation. Suso notes that this kind of statutes excludes the galician chapter of a spanish chapter, and to avoid that is necessary a federal estructure. Pablo says that ''the most logic is that if we make the asociation, it might be a statal one''. Meanwhile Gibus says that FFII is just created in France and joins the [http://brevets-logiciels.info/wiki/wakka.php?wiki=StatutS french statutes]. 

 * 2005-10-11 Antonio Zugaldía says that ''we might not talk about fundators until we have statutes, so we can know exactly what FFII is, and then if we can get compromise or not.'' Alberto proposes to make the spanish statuts from the german ones and makes a new volunteer founders calling, who ''will be the people that later will constitute the asociation and form the first temporal board until the new elections'' all that from es-help list ''public to FFII international board and private to FFII active members in Spain''.

 * 2005-10-10 Alberto informs about its activities. In PS says that ''the finantials of FFII in Spain is under zero''. Ernesto asks how to promote the asociation. Alberto asks for volunteers to form a Directive Board. Pablo joins the iniciative.

 * 2005-07-29 Iván consideers interesting to know how much people, time and resources we have. Alberto answers calling a meeting that same day in Madrid.

 * 2005-07-28 Suso comes with the galician FFII chapter proposal: to create a foundation, or if not enough patrimonial resources, then create a federation, legalizing the galician group and creating new groups.

 * Benjamin Henrion (ffii.org) says in a mail that the legal representation in Spain of FFII as a part of a free software organization is not aceptable. FFII does not represent free software, as the pro-patent lobby spread.

 * 2005-07-22 [http://libre.org/ FCL] makes this proposal:
   * ''The cheapest option (and the mos autonomous one also) will be to constitute a nacional asociation joined to the FCL. Then it will be a working group of the FCL with its own juridical personality 100%. FFII-es (or the choosed name) could present itself autonomously (beeing an asociation) or under the umbrella of the FCL as needed.''
 * 2005-07-21 alberto proposes to begin the constitution jog next week. suso will send to the list the opinion of the galician group.
 * 2005-07-20 domain names are proposed (ffii-es.org, ffii.org.es and es.ffii.org) and wiki/ CMS technologies also.
 * 2005-07-19 alberto has no confirmation of the intentions of Proinnova to legalize itself and focuses on financial and political-legal representation capabilities of a legalized FFII in the state. xavi defines [http://caliu.info/ Caliu] as a group of catalonian language users without a territorial identification; he does not see necessary to join Caliu in FFII but he can ask their users. Suso will ask the galician group.
 * 2005-07-18 suso recalls the descentralized structure of FFII, the existance of a [http://mesagalega.ffii.org/ galician group] and the needing of new groups to begin statal coordination. alberto prefers a centralized structure with the state competences. a group of FFII at Madrid is proposed.
 * 2005-07-17 jesús proposes coordination with [http://proinnova.hispalinux.es/ Proinnova]. iván focuses on the posibility of financing the group through enterprises donations.
 * 2005-07-16 alberto offers itself to legaly constitute a FFII group in Spain and redirecting ffii-es.org to the convenient web.
 * 2005-07-08 javier proposes to create a FFII group in Spain translating the original documents of other legalized FFII groups.
 * 2005-07-07 javier states the absence of a legalized FFII group in Spain.


== Tasks ==

suso will manage: 

 * the monitoring of the process
 * to obtain the opinion of the [http://mesagalega.ffii.org/ galician group] de la FFII 
 * to obtain FFII members point of view
 * to obtain information about similar experiences of clonning FFII in other states.

alberto offers himself as voluntary to:

 * Constitute an association legaly in Spain restricted to the whole Spanish territory. (Correction of Alberto: I haven't any interest in to restringe to anything, in fact, I propose taht any person that feels identified with the environment to which the FFII association will be constituted, s/he will be able to associate holding all voting rights. The idea is something like to make legal es-parl and convert it in an association of perons independly of his geographic origen. In summary, something similar to what Caliu represents in free software for Catalonian speaking persons.)
