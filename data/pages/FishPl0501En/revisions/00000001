 concerning the Directive on the Patentability Computer-Implemented
 Inventions in the agenda of the meeting of the Council of Agriculture
 and Fisheries on the 24th of January, 2005, the European Committee of
 the Council of Ministers noted on the meeting on the 21st of January

 been completed. On account of that, the European Committee has decided
 that the Permanent Representation of the Republic of Poland to the
 European Union will make a request to the Presidency not to include that
 item in the Agenda of the EU Council Meeting. If the Luxembourg
 Presidency includes the draft of the aforementioned directive in the
 agenda, Poland will request its withdrawal and postponement until the
 end of the necessary analyses being conducted by Poland.
