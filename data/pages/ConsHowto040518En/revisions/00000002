One of the biggest obstacles is that most officials, especially those from the new member states, wrongly believe that there is a strong consensus behind the council proposal.  In fact there is widespread resistance, but isolation of the resistants must be overcome.

== Call on Players ==

The Council presidency has prepared a "compromise document" for
unlimited patentability which is extreme in every way, especially in
the way in which it tries to conceal its real contents, see

Some of the responsible politicians have meanwhile become aware of this.

This gives us an opportunity to get the proposal postponed on May
18th.  All that is needed seems to be that one of the ministers
should, when asked by the Irish presidency, say that "yes, this
proposal needs discussion" and then poke some fun at the rhetorics
used in it (e.g. in Art 4A and 5(2)). 

With some effort it should be possible for 1 informed minister to make
the whole cardhouse fall apart.

There is even a good chance for such a minister to appear
"constructive" at the meeting.  E.g. by removing Art 5(2) and adopting
the german proposal for Art 2b, it might be possible to create a basis
for a further reading by the parliament -- not a good directive, but
at least something that does not ruin the directive project
altoghether.  And even something that the Irish Presidency can achieve in its term, if that is so important.

We are am now trying to put together a kind of memorandum for officials who
would like to take this path, and I am putting interested officials or
activists from various national ministeries into BCC or into a mail
alias cons040518.  Please tell cons040518 at ffii org of any email addresses we can put
there.

If it helps you can ask for submitting national signatories of petition.eurolinux.org
to national minsters (done so far in es,pt,nl,be,se), mail blasum(att)ffii.org or 
call/sms him at +49-174-7313590 (response time as fast as possible).
