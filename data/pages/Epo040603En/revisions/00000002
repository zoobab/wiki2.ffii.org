The [[http://www.suepo.org/|union of patent examiners of the European Patent Office]] is reported to have
conducted a survey which
confirms earlier reports on the FFII's [[http://swpat.ffii.org/players/epo/|EPO dossier page]] according to which
the patent examination system at the EPO has become a joke during recent years.

 * Alison Abbott, Munich Examiners at the European Patent Office (EPO) are losing confidence in patent quality, Nature Vol 429, p 493 (03 Jun 2004): "In a survey of some 1,300 patent examiners, conducted by the staff union in April, more than three-quarters agreed with the statement that productivity demands from the EPO s managers did not allow them  to enforce the quality standards set by the European Patent Convention .And 90% said that they did not have time to keep up to date with advances in their scientific fields. In a second survey of 730 examiners, done by the EPO itself, only 9% said they believed that the management was  actively involved in improving quality." ... average time 
spent on application 23.8 h in 2001 and 11.8 h in 1992 ... (nobelist
Sulston) "The bar for inventive step has been kept too low in genetic            
patenting, co-authored a report published by Royal Society in April 2003, which raised concerns about patent quality" ... "Critics point out that the EPO gains fee income from each patent it grants."...

In an answer to critical members of the European Parliament in January 2004 the president of the EPO,
Dr. Ingo Kober, [[Kober040114En| stated]] that examination quality at the EPO was under control and no special measures by the European Commission in this field were needed.  The EPO is under pressure from governmental supporters of software patents to "improve patent quality" in the software field so as to relieve these governmental patent officials of some of the public pressure which they are experiencing.
