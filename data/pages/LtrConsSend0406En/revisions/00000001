= Ask your Government to Withdraw Support for the EU Council's Software Patents Directive! =

 * ''Stop Software Patents in Europe''
 * ''Software is Not Like That''
 * ''Power to the Parliament!''

Please join us in mobilizing to send the [http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/LtrConsMinim0406.en.pdf Urgent Call document] ([http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/LtrConsMinim0406.de.pdf german]) which asks to reopen the discussion about the directive and incorporate the clarifying amendments of the European Parliament.

== What's Happening: ==

[http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/LtrConsMinim0406.en.pdf Click here for the Urgent Call document]

Look at your country's delivery page on LtrConsRecv0406En for addresses and specific instructions.

Write a quick cover letter. Don't use fax or mail, they won't get much as much attention as a written letter. Don't send a braindump to your MP, just send the Urgent Call with a short personal cover letter. If unsure how to write, contact consilium-help at ffii org for advice.

Several people can send a letter to their MP with a copy of the letter enclosed for the MP to forward to some person in charge of the issue (for example the responsible minister, an influential committee ...), to ensure this issue will not be ignored (and there's safety in numbers!).

When sending to a MP, a reference to the Protocol for national participation in EU governance referred to in Parlprot0408En is probably a good idea.

There are also a few FFII webpages which contain information on how to write a letter:
 * SwpatxatraDe (contains most introductory material), SwpatxatraEn, SwpatxatraEs, SwpatxatraFr
 * German: LtrMdb0405HowtoDe
 * http://swpat.ffii.org/group/todo/

''*When you send the letter, make note of it on your country's letters-sent page, below.*''

Wait a few days and then phone the recipient, to make sure that he pays attention to it. See [:TelHowtoEn: here] for advice.

When you receive an answer, 
 * Put it on a wiki page named Recipient + Year [+Month[+Day]] + Language Code (Just type http://kwiki.ffii.org/pagename in your browser, and it will create a new page). Use a full date in your page name
 * Link to it from your country's "letters sent" page (below)
 * Link to it from LtrCons0406En
 * Send an email announcing it to [http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/consilium-parl consilium-parl] and your [http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/ country's -parl list] for discussion. Maybe provide a translation/summary.
