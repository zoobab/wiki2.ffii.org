"Campaign for Creativity" states on their website:

 At a recent meeting with a leading member of the Socialist MEPs to
 discuss intellectual property and the campaigns being waged in
 Brussels against it, the MEP (who asked us not to publicise this name
 for fear of attack by the anti-IP lobbies) pointed out that he often
 hears from those who oppose IP rights, but never hears from those who
 support them (except us, of course!).

 He went on to point out that the trade associations often claim that
 millions of jobs depend on IP, but he wonders why he never hears from
 the actual employees themselves.

 Our point that people sometimes feel constrained by the fact that they
 work in an IP-dependent industry and therefore don't feel
 'independent', cut little ice. "If people feel that their jobs depend
 on IP then they should tell us that they support it and that their
 jobs depend on it", he said.

 He went on to say "Just because you work for a company doesn't mean
 that you are not a citizen with a legitimate right to participate in
 the democratic process."

== Comment ==

There are a lot of IT lobbying groups in favour of IP rights.
FFII itself supports copyright and defends the interests of
copyright holder against encroachment by patents. People who reject IP in
general are a minority position. Even leftwing anti-globalisation
groups such as Attac are not against those rights although there is
some anti-sentiment. So relax, there is no Anti-IP movement. [:CampaignForCreativityEn: Campaign
for Creativity], a hired Gun,
oversimplifies the discussion.

In fact many citizens are concerned about the current EU legislation
plans for patent protection of Software that will undermine their
copyright. The scope of Patent law is widened to a original field of
copyright legislation (see also [[IndpropEn| Industrial Copyright]]
debate). Many employees took action against their company's patent
attorney.

The article of C4C is not credible. An anonymous Socialist MEP at a
non-specified "recent meeting" who does not want to be cited in fear
of lobby groups (wrong job?). This sounds like a dirty lobbying fairy
tale. Even more Campaign For Creativity undermines the reputation of
[[MEP| our MEPs]]. Find out [[http://eu.ffii.org/sections/eu_democracy_day|why MEPs are no wimps]].
