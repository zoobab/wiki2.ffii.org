''Brussels, 18 May 2006 -- The Commission has answered Professor Adam Gierek MEP's question about whether it still thinks that the case law of the European Patent Office (EPO) should be apply to the Community Patent. The Commission confirmed that the EPO's case law in fact is not gospel, and that the ECJ could overturn it. They also stated in their answer that computer programs are not patentable subject matter. Unfortunately, they still fully rely on courts to make the appropriate decisions.''

== The Commission's answer ==

  P-1625/06EN Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission
  (18.5.2006)
  
  
  The explanatory memorandum of the Commission's proposal for the
  Community patent Regulation states that the European Patent "Office
  will apply to the Community patent the case law which it has developed
  for the European patent, to the extent that the rules in the
  Regulation and the Convention are identical".
  
  The Commission's proposal on the Community patent is not intended to
  amend the structure of the European patent system. Rather, it provides
  a link between the Community and the European Patent Office (EPO),
  which is not a Community body. While the pre-grant phase of the
  Community patent (including the procedural and substantive issues)
  could in principle be governed by the European Patent Convention
  (EPC), the post-grant aspects of a Community patent (including
  questions of validity, infringement, assignment and statutory or
  compulsory licensing) would be governed by the Community patent
  regulation. The EPO Patent Office would thus actually apply and be
  bound by a new unitary Community law with respect to Community
  patents. Indeed, an important feature of the proposed Community patent
  system is the accession of the Community to the EPC. By this, the
  convention becomes part of the Community acquis and subject to
  interpretation by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The ECJ is not
  bound by the case law developed by the EPO and is free in its
  interpretation of the provisions of the EPC, once it becomes part of
  the Community acquis.
  
  Moreover, with respect to the particular cases mentioned by the
  Honourable Member, the draft Community patent Regulation confirms in
  its Article 28.1(a) that patents granted for a subject matter (such as
  computer programs), which is excluded from patentability pursuant to
  Article 52 EPC, may be invalidated in a relevant court proceeding.
  
  This being said, the Directorate-General for the Internal Market and
  Services has launched a broad consultation of all interested parties
  on the future patent policy in Europe, with a particular focus on the
  structure of the European patent system. The Community patent,
  including the common political approach which was reached by the
  Council on 3 March 2003, forms part of the questions addressed to all
  stakeholders. The deadline for the consultation was 12 April 2006 and
  preliminary findings will be discussed with stakeholders at a hearing
  in Brussels that will most probably take place in June 2006. The
  Parliament will of course be duly informed of the results of this
  consultation.
