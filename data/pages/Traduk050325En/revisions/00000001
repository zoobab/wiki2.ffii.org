Currently we have 114 subscribers to the traduk-parl list, many of whom hopefully are ready to help a bit with translating.

The translation managment system is ready.  It has been debugged and
improved during recent months.  You will notice it when you send an
editable source file such as

 * http://swpat.ffii.org/swpat.en.txl
 * http://www.ffii.org/ffii.en.txl

to mlhtimport@ffii.org and read the feedback mails.

The front pages of

 * http://swpat.ffii.org/index.en.html
 * http://www.ffii.org/index.en.html

need to be localised in all languages of EU and beyond.  There can
then also be links to localised versions of the news in the right-hand
column, news tickers like

        http://wiki.ffii.org/SwpatcninoEn
        http://wiki.ffii.org/SwpatcninoFr

with RSS streams and even press release mailing lists like
fr-news at ffii org etc.

You can ask our

        Translation Helpdesk 
	traduk-help at ffii org

to be registered as responsible for a translation.  That means that
other people can then not overwrite your translation but instead are
asked to submit their texts to you.  The Helpdesk can of course also
transfer responsibility for translations to a successor.  And it
should also be able to install a fully localised front page.
