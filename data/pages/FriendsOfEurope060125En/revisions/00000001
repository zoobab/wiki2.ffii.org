= Friend's of Europe Lunch Debate on "Technology, Globalization, and Inclusion. Is innovation a development tool? " =
----

== Theme ==

  Nobody doubts that in todays Electronic Age technology is driving
  the rapid pace of change around the world. The Asian tigers and the
  dramatic economic rise of China and India owe much of their development
  to the global revolution in data processing and communications.
  But critics point to the digital divide and the widening North-South gap
  and question whether industrial innovation has been a development tool.
  Even within Europe, have the benefits of new technologies favoured some
  regions more than others? What policy measures could the EU and others
  use, to encourage the more even and widespread take-up of new technologies
  to reconcile competitiveness and inclusion?
