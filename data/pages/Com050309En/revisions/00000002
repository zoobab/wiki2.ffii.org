''In a document from the Commission directed to Mr Javier Solana and the Council delegations, the Commission denies the problems associated with Article 5 of the draft directive. The Commission however admits the text "may need further clarification". The document dated 05-03-09 was made available to the public on 05-03-14.''

== Analysis ==

=== New Objective ===

 The proposal ... aims at harmonising the provisions of national patent law dealing with inventions which rely on
 computers for their performance. The Directive will bring under the supervision of the European Court of Justice 
 the rules applicable by national courts and patent offices charged with assessing the validity of patents 
 and applications in this field. Given that many patents in
 this field are granted by the European Patent Office, the Administrative Council of the
 European Patent Organisation could be invited to consider adapting the Implementing
 Regulations of the European Patent Convention.

The Commission here 

a) confirms that the proposal is about software patents: "inventions(?) which rely on computers for their performance." Note: According to EPC 52 Program for computers are no inventions.

b) admits that the underlying agenda is to get more control over the EPO (no EU institution) and the European Patent Convention
which does not admit patenting of software. Therefore the "harmonisation"-only allegation is untrue. Furthermore only member states of the EPC, not the 
EPO can change the European Patent Convention. The current EPO guidelines are infringing on the EPC regulations according to legal scholars such as Lenz and Commissioner Bolkestein (2003-09-23 Without a directive "the European Patent Office ... would be free to continue their current practice, their current practise of issuing patents for software-implemented inventions which may blur or even cross the line in undermining the exclusion from patentability of software").

 A failure to adopt a directive would prevent Community institutions from exercising control
 in this strategic area of the European economy, which would thus remain within the remit
 only of national patent offices and courts and the European Patent Office in Munich.

FFII shares the objective of a good European directive and therefore does not understand why the Commission rejected the offer from the European Parliament to redraft the directive and limits the options of the European Parliament to kill the Council proposal or to insert its own amendments again with a giant majority needed in the second reading.

=== Computer Program claims ===

 Although the Commissions proposal did not explicitly permit claims on computer programs 
 on their own or on carriers,

True. 

 the Commission has accepted Article 5(2) of the common 
 position as this has to be understood as relating to the enforceability of (existing) 
 patent rights and not to extending the scope of patentability. 

A misleading remark. The whole directive only addresses enforcability of patents. This is the only way to stop the EPO legal drift in granting pratice. With the Council directive in place the EPO would continue to grant patents with computer program claims that will further be enforcable. There is not provision that Article 5 or parts of it only extent to the doubtful patents already granted by the EPO. And granting the enforcability of those existing patent rights will widen the scope. In short: The EU can only decide about the scope of enforcable patents. The EPO does what it wants according to its guidelines, regardless its own treaty, the EPC, regardless whatever the EU will decide. But patent rights granted by the institutions in violation of law can be challenged in court. Providing legal certainty to them means codifying legal escape.

 This is reinforced by the
 explicit link with Article 5 (1) as mentioned below. To the extent that the relationship 
 between Article 5(2)  and the exclusion of computer programs as such (as is explicitly 
 laid out in Article 4(1)) is open to differing interpretations, the text may need 
 further clarification.

 Acts relating to computer programs on their own or on carriers could be subject to 
 proceedings for contributory infringement even without provisions equivalent to 
 Article 5(2). The effect of Article 5(2) is thus to facilitate enforcement of legitimate 
 rights by ensuring that such acts may constitute direct, rather than just contributory, 
 infringements. This is particularly important in cases of infringements across national 
 boundaries as Member States courts do not have jurisdiction over contributory infringements 
 occurring outside their national territory. I n any case, the final part of Article 5(2) 
 makes clear that the claim on the computer program on its own or on a carrier has to put 
 in force a patentable product or process claimed in the same patent application (and 
 falling within the scope of Article 5(1)). This ensures that Article 5(2) cannot constitute 
 protection equivalent to the patentability of computer programs as such, a reading which 
 is furthermore confirmed by the more explicit language of the common position, in particular
 of Article 4 paragraphs 1 and 2.


This interpretation is one small step closer to the truth. Program claims in Article 5.2. were worded deceptive, with a double negation. The Commission here further reveals that [[ProgramClaimsEn| program claims]] are dangerous for the freedom of publication. Still experts do not understand the meaning of the Bolkestein insertions in article 4. The commission could further clarify their understanding and drop the [[AssuchEn| "as such"]] wording.

The new two step interpretation of the Commission that Article 5 will only extent to existing patents, and similar patents would become unpatentable because of the article 4.1 test has no credibility. It only reveals the difficulties of the Commission with the Commissions's compromise proposals tabled by Bolkestein. We proposed very early steps out of council deadlock ConsStep0406En and addressed the issue, quote:

 1. delete "magical" wordings "either as source code or object code" that were inserted by Bolkestein into Art 4A in the last minute.  Reason: Nobody wants patents on individual expressions or singular instances of programs.  These insertions serve no regulatory purpose but rather impose an interpretation on Art 52 EPC which makes the law meaningless and, probably for that reason, is rejected by the German Federal Court and even by the EPO.  Delete such wordings also from recitals where they occur.  The directive should not reinterpret the EPC in a way that does not conform to the [[http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/epc52/exeg/|normal rules of interpretation of law]].
 1. delete [[ProgramClaimsEn| Article 5(2)]].   Reason: The double negations are deceptive.  This article makes software on its own patentable.  What is claimed must be what is invented.  If a [[ProgramClaimsEn| "program, characterised by ..." is claimed]], then nothing more than a program (as such) was invented.  If an information structure can be a patentable invention, then there is no point in talking any more about definitions of "technical".  The European Commission refused program claims in its proposal of 2002 for good reasons.  Allowing them closes the door to all discussions and would therefore mean that the Council intends to kill the directive project.
