''Brussels, 13 April 2006 -- Professor Adam Gierek MEP has asked the Commission whether it still thinks that the case law of the European Patent Office (EPO) should be apply to the Community Patent. He refers to the fact that the European Parliament rejected the EPO's case law regarding software patents, a discrepancy between EPO and national patent office practice, and also to several recent court decisions in the UK. He is worried that the EPO's practice is discrediting the patent system as a whole. Professor Gierek is an inventor himself, with many patents on his name.''

== The Question ==

 A patent system can play a fundamental role in establishing an
 appropriate legal status for innovations and ensuring that their
 originators are properly rewarded. I am concerned about European
 Patent Office (EPO) practices which are undermining the social
 acceptability of the patent system, with patents being granted for
 solutions that are not patentable under the current law.

 Fortunately, the courts in the Member States are making use of their
 right to rescind patents granted by the EPO for software and
 business methods. The difference in approach between the EPO and,
 for example, the Polish patent office is illustrated by the fact
 that the latter has for months been refusing to grant two patents to
 applicants granted patents by the EPO. To date, the Polish courts
 have upheld these decisions.

 Recently, the High Court of England and Wales ruled that two patents
 granted by the EPO were invalid on UK territory and emphasised the
 need for computer programs to be excluded from the scope of patent
 law even in cases where the use of a program produces a physical effect.

 Before the vote held in the European Parliament on 6 July 2005, the
 rapporteur, Michel Rocard, said that 'rejection [:of :the directive]
 is a message directed at the European Patent Office. The European
 Parliament has refused to ratify the recent judicial errors by
 extending the scope of patentability to certain software programs'.
 However, the EPO has not heeded that message and has not changed its
 practices.

 Given the above, does the Commission still stand by the position set
 out in point 2.3.2 of the proposal for a Council Regulation on the
 Community patent (COM(2000) 412 final - 2000/0177(CNS) ), namely
 that the case law which the EPO developed for the European patent
 will apply to the Community patent?
