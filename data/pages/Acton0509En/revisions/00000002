''The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, an American think tank with affinity to the Catholic Church, is deeply disturbed by the defeat of the software patent directive in Europe.  In a lead article which quotes words of the late pope John Paul II, it claims that private ownership of ideas is a needed moral right and that any denial of such ownership claims, as seen in the refusal to accept software patents, represents a victory of "pirates" who "sow the seeds of destruction".  The Institute commends the European Commission for its latest legislative moves, which show that it is unimpressed by the pirates and steadfastly promoting the cause of "intellectual property".''

   Hopeful signs are emerging for the future of economic prosperity in
   Europe despite some serious opposition. The European Parliament
   [122]recently moved to scrap the ratification of an informal agreement
   reached last year by EU member states and supported by the European
   Commission, that would have made important strides forward in the
   legal recognition of intellectual property rights.
   The Computer Implemented Inventions Directive (CIID), which would
   protect intellectual property and standardize EU software patent law,
   now appears dead. This leaves in place a patchwork of national patent
   laws that effectively stifles a common set of laws and regulations in
   Europe.

   These sorts of delays and backsliding by the Parliament represent
   serious threats to European economies and could add to a dangerous
   precedent in light of the EUs ruling against software company
   Microsoft.

   The ownership of property is not merely a right to property, but is
   better conceived a fundamental human right, and is affirmed as such by
   the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Everyone has the right to
   own property alone as well as in association with others (Article 17).
   It is simply myopic to view property as merely physical objects,
   rather than that effort, talent, time and risk (i.e., lives) that go
   into producing legitimate property.

   This is affirmed throughout the social teaching of the Catholic Church
   especially in the encyclical Centesimus Annus by Pope John Paul II
   where he writes, In our time, in particular, there exists another form
   of ownership which is becoming no less important than land: the
   possession of know-how, technology and skill. The wealth of the
   industrialized nations is based much more on this kind of ownership
   than on natural resources.

   One of the key roles of government is the ardent defense of an
   exclusive right to market ones ideas in the form of intellectual
   property. Even the European Constitution, which itself has met serious
   opposition, states, Intellectual property shall be protected (Article
   II-77.2).

   [...]
	
   And the lack of such protections is having real economic
   consequences for Europe. A 2001 study by the World Customs
   Organization concluded that about one third of software across Western
   Europe is pirated and that counterfeit music CDs have become more
   valuable, by weight, than cannabis - a kilo of cannabis will fetch EUR
   2,000, while a kilo of counterfeit CDs is worth EUR 3,000.

   The popularity of digital media and broadband distribution has only
   exacerbated the availability of pirated materials. Music, movies, and
   software are readily available for download via global file-sharing
   software. Without the legal protection from such electronic theft, the
   proliferation of such piracy can only increase.

   And this is precisely why the European Parliaments move to forestall
   the implementation of substantive and necessary protections of
   property rights is so troublesome. As the CIID appears dead, we can
   only hope that future policies protecting intellectual property, like
   the Commission's proposals for music copyright standardization, will
   not be defeated. Further delays would only serve to embolden the
   purveyors of software and music piracy, giving them more time and
   opportunity to sow the seeds of economic destruction.
