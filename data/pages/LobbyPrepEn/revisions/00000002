Outline of a guide to be written.

This page is, currently, just an idea, and the structure proposed below is quick-and-dirty from someone with minimal lobbying experience. Feel free to delete it in its entirety and rewrite it from scratch.

=== How to dress ===

Your cloth must be something you feel confortable with as you wear it for the day, maybe under stress.
Also the way you dress might be different depending on wich MEP you want to meet.

=== What to have with you ===

 * Printed version of the most important documents that you are ready to give away (giving an URL will not work).
 * Your ID card (see next point)
 * Paper and Pen (to take fresh notes after your meeting and report)

=== How to enter the Parliament ===

 * You must have an ID to enter the Parliament.
 * Only someone with a "blue badge" (Civil Servant, Political Staff, Assistant or MEP can let you in)
 * You will get a white "visitor" badge valid for the day, however you are suppose to stick with the assistant that let you in. Security guard are arround and check badge that should be wear visibly. It is best avoid the Bridge between PHS and ASP (stick with ASP building where the MEP and the food is) if you are not escorted.

=== How to select MEPs and choose the order of your visits ===
