The Social Democrat Party is Denmark's main centre-left party,  belonging to the PES group in the European Parliament. Unlike its sister parties in other Scandinavian countries, it is not gung-ho in favour of software patents. Both its MEPs present for the vote voted against swpat in September 2003. However, the party tends to take a 'wait and see' attitude. It helped oblige minister Bendt Bendsen to make a stand against the A item in the council meeting on 7 March, but [[http://wiki.ffii.org/Kofod050310En|did not vote to no-confidence him]] when he did not actually do so.
