''24 February 2005 -- Today, the European Parliament unanimously supported a plenary motion, in which it "invites the Commission to review its proposal for the software patents directive in accordance with the decisions in Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on 2 February 2005 and the Conference of Presidents 17 February 2005".''

The text on the software patent directive was proposed by Polish MEP [[JerzyBuzekEn| Jerzy Buzek]] (prime minister of Poland 1997-2001).  Buzek spoke shortly to explain it.  It was supported by all party groups and carried without objection (i.e. by acclamation, without a roll call).

The text passage for which the !MEPs expressed support reads:

  "Invites the Commission to review its proposal for the software
  patents directive in accordance with the decisions in Legal Affairs
  Committee of the European Parliament on 2 February 2005 and the
  Conference of Presidents 17 February 2005".

It forms part of a [[http://tinyurl.com/4whzs|Joint Motion]] on the Commission's
Legislative and Work Programme for 2005.

Erik Josefsson, FFII Brussels representative comments:

   "It is now clear that the EP as a whole stands behind the software patent
   restart process that was initiated by Mr Buzek and Mr Gierek in December,
   verified by the Polish minister of informatisation at the Fisheries Council
   before Christmas, confirmed by the Legal Affairs Committee in January,
   executed by the CoP in February and finally wholly supported by the EP today.
   I would like to say: "Can you hear us now, Mr. McCreevy?"

Various groups in the Parliament had proposed similar motions
independently:

[[http://tinyurl.com/5sal3|PSE (socialists)]]:

  13. Calls on the Commission to consult Parliament again on the
  proposal for a directive on the patenting of computer-implemented
  inventions so that European legislation can strike a better balance
  between all the interests involved;

## [http://tinyurl.com/3lceh ALDE (liberals)]:
##  3. Invites the Commission to review its proposal for the software
##  patents directive and to bring forward its legislative proposals for
##  an integrated system of general patents;

[[http://tinyurl.com/5om97|Greens:]]

  27. Requests the Commission to re-draft the directive on the
  patentability of so-called 'computer implemented inventions' in order
  to establish a clear legal distinction between what is technical and
  can be patented and what is not; recommends that the Commission give
  more support to the development of free and open source software
  within the strategy for the European Information Society up to 2010;

[[http://tinyurl.com/58787|GUE/NGL (Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left)]]:

  4.  Calls on the Commission and the Council to withdraw the directive
  on software patents, and calls on the Commission to give priority to
  the development of free and open-source software and to eliminating
  the 'digital divide' within the strategy on the Information Society up
  to 2010;

## There's nothing about patents in the motions of [http://tinyurl.com/6h6qc UEN (conservatives)] and [http://tinyurl.com/6vq7t PPE (Christian-Democrats)], but both groups agreed to the item as proposed by Buzek in the plenary.

## The UEN and PPE motions were joint with the ALDE motion 
##   JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION [...]
##   replacing the motions by the following groups:
##   UEN (B6&#8209;0106/2005)
##   ALDE (B6&#8209;0115/2005)
##   PPE-DE (B6&#8209;0120/2005)
##   on the CommissionÂ’s legislative and work programme for 2005
