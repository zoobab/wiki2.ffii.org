# Identifying wrong and side arguments in the current software patent debate {#identifying_wrong_and_side_arguments_in_the_current_software_patent_debate}

This page will pick arguments in the software patent debate and shortly
discuss them, target is to speed up the debate by eliminating all side
arguments so the debate can focus on the crucial points. New arguments
are on top.

Actually it is just for putting order into my own grasp of the
discussion.

## [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") do NOT need patents {#smes_do_not_need_patents}

**\"Patents are cheap and easy inquestable\"**, Mr. Betten, CDU Hearing,
 12/05 in Stuttgart

Just have a look at the figures:

1.  patent inquest: 500  and more
2.  patent application: 50.000 
3.  patent process: 1.000.000  and more

Each day aprox. 5 new software patents are added. Of couse the statement
of Dr. Betten ist subjective, but it is my personal opinion that his
statement is WRONG.

**\"Patents are in the hand of** [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")\*\", \"There is
a chance that\* [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") **compete against international
enterprises\"**, Mr. Mingorance, SME Intergroup Meeting, 11/05 in
Strasbourg

Having a quick look at the [top 100
applicants](http://gauss.ffii.org/Statistics/Granted/Applicant "wikilink")
of all granted software patents in the [software patent
database](http://gauss.ffii.org "wikilink"), you will come to the
following summary:

1.  50% of all granted software patents are in the hand of 42 companies
2.  The top 100 software patent applicants own together 63% of all
    software patents

After comparing the applicants with the [EICTA
memberlist](http://www.eicta.org/Content/Default.asp?PageID=166 "wikilink")
there is another aspect which should be mentioned:

-   37% of all granted software patents belong to EICTA members

Conclusion: The statements of Mr. Mingorance are misleading, because it
implicates that more than 50% of all patents are in the hand of !SMEs.
If this is what Mr. Mingorance wanted to say the statements are simply
WRONG.

**\"Patents enhance access and are necessary to build business around**
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")\", Mr. Mingorance, SME Intergroup Meeting, 11/05
in Strasbourg

This argument has a logical error. If you have 1,2 or 10 patents how can
you create a working solution without infringing hundereds of other
patents? Even if you are using the patent system like it should be used
and you will share the knowledge with others you have to pay for example
for every patent you infringe 1% of your turnover then you have nothing
left at the end. There are some possibilities to solve this problem:

1.  Cross licensing, this can only be done if you have a lot of
    patents - means you are an enterprise company
2.  Selling the patent to a patent troll who sues other companies and
    gives 20% back to the patent owner
3.  Blocking the patent and putting all hope to be bought by a big
    company

Conclusion: This statement may be true for the rest of the patentable
inventions, but it is not practical in the field of software
development, so it is simply WRONG.

## Copyright IS sufficient to protect innovation {#copyright_is_sufficient_to_protect_innovation}

**\"The Copyright is too weak for SME and universities\"**, Mr. Betten,
CDU Hearing,  12/05 in Stuttgart

This statement is wrong, because of the following reasons:

1.  Copyright is self evident, you can go with the result of your work
    to court to compare it
2.  Copyright is applying just in time, without delay by the patent
    office and without additional cost
3.  Copyright protects structures as well, a copy from one programming
    language to another is a copyright infringement
4.  Copyright protects layout as well, if you copy a user interface it
    is a copyright infringement

Conclusion: Copyright is the only practicable way of protecting
intellectual properties and innovation. The statement of Mr. Betten is
WRONG.
