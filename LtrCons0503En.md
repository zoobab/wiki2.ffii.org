*6 March 2005 \-- FFII is starting a campaign of support for Denmark\'s
initiative to reopen negotiations on software patents in the EU Council.
The campaign site thankdenmark.info which was just launched, starts by
praising Denmark\'s move as a historic step toward parliamentary
democracy in the EU and asking supporters to write letters to various
politicians. Letter templates are collected on a related site.*

Stream from the Council (if you hear nothing, then it has not yet
started or the interesting part is over):

## Needed Messages {#needed_messages}

-   Reversing the Swpat Agreement does not mean Reversing every
    Agreement. EU is not a banana republic. Late B-Items are only a weak
    safety valve. Ministers only need to consult with their national
    parliaments to assure that agreements are reasonably stable.
-   Commission must not be allowed to withdraw the directive. The
    problems created by the EPO call for a Europe-wide solution, and the
    EP has worked constructively on this solution. The Commission\'s
    attitude of either imposing EPO practice or doing nothing is
    inacceptable. (NL patent lobby (government, VVD, Philips) as well as
    Lehne, patent bullies and a few others are currently mobilising for
    withdrawal of the directive and will use this to pressure Denmark
    and Poland)
-   Outrage at Commission\'s handling of directive, call for transfer of
    responsibility away from DG MARKT
-   Consilium and EP are very far apart (NL governmental+philips patent
    lobby is pretending that the texts are similar and lax triviality
    standards are the only problem, retraction of directive plus an
    exhortation to the EPO on triviality would be enough)
-   Call for a national regulation that forbids granting of program
    claims by national offices and mandates deletion of program claims
    from EPO patents that enter the national phase. (This makes it clear
    that we are continuing at the national level in any case, so the
    patent lobby doesn\'t gain anything by having the directive
    withdrawn. The EPO praxis is based on quite weak grounds, and is
    probably the most basic reason to why some wants to codify it in a
    directive)
