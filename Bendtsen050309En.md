*Copenhagen, 9 March 2005 \-- Denmark\'s minister of economy Bendt
Bentsen is facing accusations from his parliament that he acted against
his mandate from the Parliament to request a reopening of negotiations
(B-Item) in the Council session that \"adopted\" a software patent draft
without a qualified majority last Monday. The accusation is confirmed by
Dutch minister Brinkhorst, who had explained in his parliament that
Bentsen did not really ask for the B-Item but performed a \"coitus
interruptus\". This allegation has enraged Bendtsen.*

*Copenhagen, 9 March 2005 \-- Ritzau*

**Danish Minister of Finance, Trade and Industry Bendt Bendtsen was
again accused of having neglected his mandate from the Danish parliament
on the issue of the EU directive on software patents.**

In a debate in the Dutch parliament Tuesday evening, Bendtsen\'s Dutch
colleague Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst accused the Dane of \"not having
insisted\" during a meeting of the EU Council of Ministers in Brussels
on Monday.

\"Denmark left the church without singing\" Brinkhorst said about
Bendtsen. The expression is sexually charged and corresponds to
\"getting off in Roskilde\"¹.

In Denmark Bendtsen is being criticized by political parties
Socialistisk Folkeparti and Radikale Venstre for not having respected
the mandate he received from a parliament majority. Bendtsen
categorically denies.
