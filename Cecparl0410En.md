## Hearing Excerpts {#hearing_excerpts}

### 2004-09-29 Viviane Reding (Information Society) {#viviane_reding_information_society}

(summary: apparently completely ignorant of her future field of
responsibility and unashamed of this ignorance)

    summary](http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/audicom2004/resume/040929_reding_EN.pdf "wikilink")

\"The question of patent law, also important for industry, particularly
the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, was raised by
several Members, including David HAMMERSTEIN MINTZ (Greens/EFA, ES) and
Esko SEPPÄNNEN (GUE/NGL, FI). The [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") defended open
source software as a way of offering greater access to technology for
everyone as it cost less. Furthermore it was a way of encouraging young
people to be innovative. Mrs Reding said she was very aware of this
problem, which brought copyright into conflict with freedom of use.
\"Ultimately\", she said, \"it is a commercial problem and we have to
reconcile interests\". She reminded Members that the directive on the
subject would return to Parliament for second reading after it had
passed before the Council of Ministers.\" \-\--\> [20040929reding

#### Source 2 {#source_2}

DG Infso having been very involved (and critical) in the elaboration of
the directive, and given rumours that the software patents directive
would move to her future DG, Mrs Reding was questionned on this by the
Green David Hammerstein (Spain) and by Vittorio Prodi (ALDE, Italy). She
provided vague answers and could not elaborate :

\"It is the same old fight between those who want to protect copyright
and those who want everything free ; I think the open source is good but
we need to pay the authors; in May the Council choose to take a step
forward, (\...) McCreevy will be in charge, (\...) the ball is not in
the camp of the Commission anymore.\"

### Charly [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink") (Internal Market) {#charly_mccreevy_internal_market}

The successor of Bolkestein will be the lead Commissionner for the
software patent directive; he was asked 2 questions, by Heide Rühle
(Greens/EFA, DE) Germany) on software patents and open source software
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), and by Maria Berger (PSE, AT). His response
shows that he has bought into some of the common belief statements about
the universally beneficial effects of whatever comes under the label
\"intellectual property\", but may be more aware of the limits of his
knowledge (and thus more open) than Reding.

McCreevy answers regarding patents in the Written Specific
Questionnaire:

14\. What is your attitude to intellectual property rights in general?
Would you envisage action to assist small firms financially and
otherwise to acquire, defend and exploit their ideas and inventions?
What is your attitude to criticisms of the patent system (e.g. from the
open-source community), and would you consider revisiting the European
Patent Convention in order to take them into account (say by raising the
hurdle for inventive step)?

Intellectual property rights are a very important means to stimulate
innovation and thereby enhance growth.Whether we talk about patents,
trademarks, or copyright, the economic dimension of the sectors and
industries benefiting from intellectual property protection in Europe is
very significant and has enormous potential.

Beyond the economic dimension, there is also of course the more
qualitative dimension of our creativity and cultural diversity. The
contribution of robust intellectual property protection to achieving the
Lisbon objective (which, let us not forget, is about becoming the best
knowledge-based economy in the world) is clear. It is also clear that
innovation and creativity are at risk to piracy and counterfeiting.To
best serve our economic objectives, intellectual property protections
need to be framed not only with rights- holders in mind, but also
consumers and competitors. They also need to be enforceable and
enforced. It is indeed important that [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") are able
to benefit from such protections they are among our most inventive
firms. Our job is therefore to design protections which are accessible
to them. As far as I can judge at present, this should not require
SME-specific instruments.

For example, the adoption of the Community Patent would make EU-wide
patent protection significantly cheaper and simpler to obtain and
thereby help [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") in particular to bring their
innovations to market. I can only regret that efforts to create the
Community patent have not been successful.This illustrates one of the
weaknesses of the Lisbon process - lack of delivery!I am of course aware
of the various criticisms which are made of the patent system. I pledge
myself to conducting my policy deliberations in an open and broad-based
way and to seeking balanced solutions. As for the European Patent
Convention, this is of course an international agreement which is
independent of the Community. As patent protection is of interest to
companies of all sizes, I do not see that reducing its scope is the
obvious way to make the patent system more accessible to
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink").

### Günter Verheugen {#günter_verheugen}

Supports SME, ability to innovation and flexibility were regarded as key
to success.

\"Die Innovationsfähigkeit und die Flexibilität der KMU seien
entscheidende Faktoren und die KMU, das Rückrat der europäischen
Wirtschaft, müssten in die Lage versetzt werden, den neuen Anforderungen
gerecht zu werden.\"

## TODO

-   archive streams and audio etc.
-   extract swpat specific parts
-   Verify Reding report
    -   -   listen to [mp3
            file](http://80.200.251.166/public/epmp3/29-09%20Reding.mp3 "wikilink"),
            transscribe
        -   make phone calls to find out who wrote the report
        -   Did Viviane Reding really confuse copyright with patent law?
            Did the Greens really confuse the free vs proprietary
            question with the copyright vs patents question? Against
            which accusations did they have to \"defend open source
            software\"?
        -   \"The question of patent law, also important for industry 
            particularly the patentability of computer-implemented
            inventions\" \--\> Who says this? To the naive reader, it
            means that the \"software industry\" needs patents. What was
            said by Greens, what by Reding, what by journalists?
        -   Get the report rectified. Complain?
