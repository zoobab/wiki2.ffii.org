# 2005-01-07 US BSA Concerned about Patent Litigation Costs {#us_bsa_concerned_about_patent_litigation_costs}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a new paper, the Business Software Alliance (BSA), a copyright
enforcement initiative financed mainly by Microsoft, raises concerns
about \"spiraling litigation costs over patenting rights\" which
\"threaten to stifle innovation\". BSA is particularly worried about
small patent licensing companies that specialise on attacking large
companies.

-   [BSA: Intellectual Property 21st
    Century](http://bsa.org/ceoinitiative/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=21193&hitboxdone=yes "wikilink")
-   BSA recommends only minor reforms of the US patent system. In
    principle, BSA wants software to be patentable in the US, in Europe
    and everywhere.
-   The paper is part of a \"CEO Initiative\", with other documents to
    follow.

## Quotes from the BSA paper {#quotes_from_the_bsa_paper}

*In recent years, the number of patent lawsuits filed against software
companies has increased substantially. In some instances, these suits
are based on poor-quality patents, and companies have had to defend
themselves in situations where the legal merits of the suit have been
questionable.*

*Reduce the Disruptions Caused by Litigation*

*Today, injunction can be obtained on a mere showing of likelihood of
success, with enormous potential for disruptive effects. For example, as
few as 1,000 lines of code, in a program consisting of over 5,000,000
lines, may be the subject of an alleged infringement action. Under
current rules, an injunction may well make it impossible to continue
selling the product as a whole while the litigation is pending. This is
clearly an unfair and disruptive threat.*

### Comment

[ Hartmut Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink") remarks:

It is more realistic to assume that a patent is normally infringed on by
10 or fewer lines of code. A normal patent claim contains only the
information that is normally written in 1 line.

It is interesting that BSA uses the word \"unfair\". This could relate
to the copyright part of [
[TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink")](SwpattripsEn "wikilink") article 13 that
says:

` "Members shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights`\
` to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal`\
` exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the`\
` legitimate interests of the right holder."`\

Indeed the rights of copyright holders are being unfairly compromised by
patent holders. We already have an international treaty that forbids us
to legislate in a manner that unreasonably prejudices the legitimate
interests of the copyright holder.

## Report in Washington Post 2005-01-05 {#report_in_washington_post_2005_01_05}

*The BSA also proposed changes to U.S. patent law. The technology
industry is facing spiraling litigation costs over patent rights, which
the BSA said threatens to stifle innovation.*

*One problem is that as patents have proliferated, a new kind of
business has emerged in which companies seek to enforce patents solely
to make money, not to use the technology. Even when the patents are not
likely to stand up in court, companies often settle with the patent
owners rather than go through costly legal battles.*
