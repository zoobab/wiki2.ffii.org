Finally a consortium of software professionals with big industry backing
is able to speak up on patent policy matters. So far it has been a
privilege of the patent lawyer community to brandish names of these big
companies. Some of the companies are now in both camps at the same time.
This is not really a contradiction.

Object: Open Letter on Software Patentability in Europe

Dear Ms., Dear Mr.,

I am writing to you as a European citizen and in my capacity of
President of the [ObjectWeb](ObjectWeb "wikilink") consortium. I wish to
draw your attention to the critical stakes underlying software
patentability issues, that will be on the Parliament agenda after your
election.

A European directive that will allow the granting of patents on
software, services or ideas would have a disastrous effect on the
European software and computing industry. It would weaken the
technological independence of Europe by undermining the regulatory
framework that protects the autonomy of its public and private
information systems. Moreover, it would be an economic absurdity: recent
conclusions from the US Federal trade Commission have confirmed the
counter-productive effect of patents in the software domain. You should
also note that software patents would be used as a weapon against free /
open source software, which is increasingly being adopted by many
European and world wide governments.

We draw your attention to the core importance of information technology
for the future of our democracies. Whether for education, citizen
information, or electronic administration services, the digital
democracy will rest on information systems whose function must be
developed in true transparency, according to the democratic process.
Software will play a role everywhere, and its control through patents
could result in de facto and arbitrary regulations, with extremely
detrimental consequences for the daily life of European citizens.

The democratic vote of the European Parliament resulted in an
intelligent and moderate position, it should not be discarded under the
influence of organisations that do not represent the citizens of Europe,
and moreover, are under suspicion of connection with economic
monopolies.

Beyond these considerations of substance, I wish to state my deep
concern on how the European Commission and Council now propose to
discard the amendments from the vote of the European Parliament on 24
September 2003 on directive proposal 20002/0047(COD). The desire of the
Irish Presidency of the European Council to discard the Parliament
position is impossible for us to understand. Such an attitude can only
result in a major crisis of confidence in the European democratic
institutions for the citizens of Europe.

As president of the [ObjectWeb](ObjectWeb "wikilink") consortium, which
brings together more than 35 international companies, I enclose for your
attention a whitepaper developed within !ObjectWeb on software
patentability issues. You will see that this text does not come from
people alien to the world of software. On the contrary, it was produced
by researchers and business-oriented company staff who have been
actively engaged in software and IT innovation from many years. This
whitepaper synthetises the reasons for software to remain outside the
scope of patents and proposes a world wide harmonisation on the basis of
the existing European legislation.

I remain available for any additional information on the subject, and
would be happy to discuss this subject with you in person if you deem
useful.

Sincerely yours,

Jean-Pierre Laisné President of the [ObjectWeb](ObjectWeb "wikilink")
Consortium
