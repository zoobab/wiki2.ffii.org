# Munich City Administration: Software Patents Threaten Linux Migration {#munich_city_administration_software_patents_threaten_linux_migration}

The decision of the city of Munich to have all of the IT infrastructure
of its administration migrate to Linux received media attention around
the globe.

On Friday, July 23rd, the CIO of the Munich city administration, Wilhelm
Hoegner, declared at a public event in front of about 70 participants
that he sees the possible ratification of software patents by the EU as
a major threat to the Linux migration project of the city of Munich, and
to the free source development model in general. He responded to a
related question from the audience, and did not deny that the decision
by the city of Munich to migrate to Linux could evolve into a mistake
due to software patents.

The official title of Wilhelm Hoegner is not CIO. In German, his title
is \"Amtsleiter, Amt für Informations- und Datenverarbeitung\", which
could be translated as \"head of the information and data processing
department\".
