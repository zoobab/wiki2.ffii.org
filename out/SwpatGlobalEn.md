# Global comparison of software patents {#global_comparison_of_software_patents}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(as proposed by Ramanraj 26 Jan 2005)

## Laws

-   India: Patents Act 1970, first patent law 1911
-   USA: [US Patent Act](http://www.bitlaw.com/source/35usc/ "wikilink")
-   EU: [European Patent Convention
    (EPC)](http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/ "wikilink")
    (1973, this European agreement has been implemented into national
    law of EU member states quite literally, eg into German law); an
    attempt to make it allow software patents explicitly announced in in
    the Journal of the European Patent Office in 1999 has failed in 2000
    due to resistance by member states. Note that the EPC is **no** EU
    treaty and extents to non-EU states as well such as Switzerland and
    Norway.
-   EU: EU Directive on Computer-Implemented Inventions [proposed by the
    European
    Commission](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/ "wikilink")
    in 2002, (in favor of software patents) [amended by the European
    Parliament](http://swpat.ffii.org/log/03/plen0924/index.en.html "wikilink")
    in 2003 (\"Parliament version\", against software patents), amended
    by the [Council of
    Ministers](http://swpat.ffii.org/log/04/cons0518/index.en.html "wikilink")
    in 2004 as Political Agreement (\"Council version\", in favor of
    software patents), [not yet passed as Common Position by the Council
    of Ministers due to opposition by
    Poland](http://swpat.ffii.org/log/04/cons1221/index.en.html "wikilink")
-   [TRIPS](http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_01_e.htm "wikilink")
    1994, ([FFII comment on
    TRIPS](http://swpat.ffii.org/stidi/trips/index.en.html "wikilink"))

## Institutions and Stakeholders {#institutions_and_stakeholders}

-   Patent Offices: USPTO, EPO, national European PTO
-   Patent professionals and their organisations such as [
    FICPI](FicpiEn "wikilink")
-   [ WIPO](WipoEn "wikilink"), Geneve
-   FFII (mostly ordoliberal Agenda: Free Information Infrastructure)
-   Free Software and Open Source People, Shareware-Association
-   Small Business Associations
-   Patent Attorneys from large enterprisesn such as Fritz Teufel (IBM),
    Tim Frain (Nokia)

## Location of patent office {#location_of_patent_office}

-   India:
-   USA: [USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/ "wikilink"), Alexandria, Virginia
-   EU: the [European Patent
    Office](http://www.european-patent-office.org/ "wikilink") is mainly
    operating at Munich (Germany) and Den Haag (Netherlands). Moreover,
    each nation state has their own patent office. Here is a [database
    of European patents](http://ep.espacenet.com/ "wikilink").

## Can patents be acquired by the government? {#can_patents_be_acquired_by_the_government}

-   India: yes
-   Europe: yes

## Duration of patents {#duration_of_patents}

-   India: 20 years
-   USA: 20 years
-   Europe: 20 years

## What is a patent {#what_is_a_patent}

-   India: 2(j) new product
-   EU: Art 52 (1) EPC: \"European patents shall be granted for any
    inventions which are susceptible of industrial application, which
    are new and which involve an inventive step.\"
-   TRIPS: Art 27: \"Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3,
    patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or
    processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new,
    involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial
    application.\"
-   US Patent Act Art 101: \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and
    useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or
    any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent
    therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this
    title.\"

## What is not a patent {#what_is_not_a_patent}

-   India: abstract theories, computer programs
-   EU: Art 52 (2) EPC: \"The following in particular shall not be
    regarded as inventions \... (a) discoveries, scientific theories and
    mathematical methods; (b) aesthetic creations; (c) schemes, rules
    and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing
    business, **and programs for computers**, (d) presentations of
    information\". **Note** that the European Patent Office tries to
    undermine the computer program exception for several years, which
    may be sanctioned by the Directive on Computer-Implemented
    Inventions if we get the Council Version, which would allow patents
    on computer programs [once they have a non-defined technical effect,
    that is eg they run on a
    computer](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/tech/index.en.html "wikilink").
-   TRIPS: Art 10 Computer programs, whether in source or object code,
    shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention

## Do software patents exist {#do_software_patents_exist}

-   Europe: the European Patent Office has granted [30000 of
    them](http://gauss.ffii.org/ "wikilink"), national patent offices
    have been more reluctant, although the UK patent office and the
    German patent office also have granted quite a few, whereas France
    and Italy are said to be more restrictive
-   US: yes, never had a Parliament decide, they crept in by caselaw

## Are software patents enforced? {#are_software_patents_enforced}

-   US:
    [yes](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/index.en.html "wikilink")
-   Europe: rarely, due to weak legal status (EPC), but this will change
    if Europe gets the Council version of the Directive on
    Computer-Implemented Inventions (whereas the Parliament version will
    keep Europe software-patent free)

## Economical evidence on cost of software patents {#economical_evidence_on_cost_of_software_patents}

-   US: Jim Bessen: an empirical look at software patents
    <http://www.researchoninnovation.org/swpat.pdf>
-   patent insurance is sold at 0.5-1% of turnover in continental
    Europe, 1-2% in UK and US (this only protects agains law suits, not
    against the costs of adapting your business, not being able to
    compete)
-   [FFII Collection of Study
    results](http://swpat.ffii.org/letters/cons0406/parl/index.en.html "wikilink")

## Which percentage do small and medium enterprises have in the software market? {#which_percentage_do_small_and_medium_enterprises_have_in_the_software_market}

-   EU: [70-80%](http://swpat.ffii.org/sektor/ "wikilink")

## Do patents on business methods exists? {#do_patents_on_business_methods_exists}

-   France tried that during the French Revolution in 1793, but gave up
    soon for it made big chaos
-   US: yes
-   EU: arguable, if guised as computer programs, eg Pension Benefit
    System
