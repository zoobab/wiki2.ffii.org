## Outline & Backgrounds {#outline_backgrounds}

-   [Timeline Inc](http://www.timeline.com/ "wikilink") has patented
    some essential uses of databases which customers of companies such
    as Oracle or Microsoft almost necessarily run into when writing
    scripts

-   Microsoft has not paid Timeline the sub-licensing royalties, i.e. it
    has preferred to expose its customers to the patent risk, apparently
    hoping that the patents would fall or that Timeline would find it
    difficult to bring the customers to court.
-   It appears from the PRs and news reports that Timeline did not apply
    for patents in Europe, although a large part of their business is in
    UK. We have yet to research the patents concerned.
