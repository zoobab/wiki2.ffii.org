A Pamphlet and the qestionnaire is available here on in 10 languages:
<http://www.ffii.org/~bkaindl/questionnaire/>

LUG hellas(Greece) has a greek version of the questionnaire and the
background document in greek.

## Notes

-   notes on Q1: freedom of publication implies rejection of program
    claims, also according to JURI. In the JURI vote of 2003-06-17
    freedom of publication (5A?) became \"caduc\" because program claims
    had already been accepted.
-   notes on Q2: the former numbering 6a is now overwritten by teh
    Parliament secretariat. Also the exact wording of 6a can be
    improved.
