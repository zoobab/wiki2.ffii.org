# Campaign for Creativity publish the names of their financers {#campaign_for_creativity_publish_the_names_of_their_financers}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After several complains from Lobby watch and some
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink"), the website of \"Campaign for Creativity\" has
[finally displayed the name of their
financers](http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm "wikilink").
A version [archived by archive.org shows that this old page
](http://web.archive.org/web/20041027210658/campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm "wikilink")
was not mentionning the name of their financers. The date of
modification of the about page on the C4C website is prior to 22 mei
2005 01:13:45 - the date of the latest google cache ([Google cache of
the
page](http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:JlMjZPjmc0IJ:campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/about.htm "wikilink")).
