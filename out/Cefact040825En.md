    (a large number of derived articles have been published)
-   [NYTPrintText](NYTPrintText "wikilink")
-   article suggests that the body is asking members to pledge that they
    will not later come out with software patents to charge royalties
    for the standards that they are jointly developping. SAP and others
    find this unacceptable
    -   -   possibly the UN body is also trying to prevent the
            participants from sending proxies to come up with software
            patents later
        -   unfortunately the author leaves the heart of the dispute
            clouded, only cites complaints of SAP et al about
            \"indemnification against all intellectual property claims\"
            and links this to the SCO case
        -   there also seems to be a conflict about whether royalties
            should be charged for the standard. The author leaves this
            clouded, but the hint about conflicts between an open-source
            and a proprietary (Microsoft) camp suggests that this is the
            subject of conflict.
