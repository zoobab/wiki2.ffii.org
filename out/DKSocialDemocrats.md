-\> [DkSocDemEn](DkSocDemEn "wikilink") This page is about the danish
Social Democrats, you might want to check the general overview of the
[danish situation.](http://kwiki.ffii.org/SwpatdkEn "wikilink")

The Social Democrats are a key player in the software patent question
after the Feb 2005 elections:

The government has been unable to count on their usual support, the EU
skeptic Danish People\'s Party, as they have rejected software patents.
Instead the government has relied on the major opposition party, the
Social Democrats. Late january 2005 this support fell away as the Social
Democrats [demanded](http://wiki.ffii.org/Buksti0501En "wikilink") that
the Council decision be delayed till after the election which the
government [had to give in
to](http://wiki.ffii.org/Holmsgaard0501En "wikilink"). For now it has
been delayed until the question can be decided in the parliamentary
Committee on European Affairs. This committee will not meet until feb 22
at the earliest.

What stance the Social Democrats will take in the end is uknown, but
they recently denounced Bill Gates\' [threats to close a danish
subsidiary](http://wiki.ffii.org/Navision050215En "wikilink") in a
[press release.](http://wiki.ffii.org/Adelskov050215En "wikilink")
Currently the party is in an internal battle for the chairman post since
former chairman Lykketoft stepped down after the election defeat.

The Social Democrat signing the put-swpat-on-hold
[letter](http://wiki.ffii.org/Buksti0501En "wikilink") that delayed the
Council A-item, Jacob Buksti, was not re-elected, but their IT
spokesman, (as of 2005-02-15) Thomas Adelskov was.
