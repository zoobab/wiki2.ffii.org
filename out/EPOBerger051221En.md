*Before Christmas 2005 the European Patent Office published a study by
German consultancy company Roland Berger. In August 2004 the study was
first presented to the EPO according to the document. The late
publication of the study raises questions as the study confirms the
extraordinary transaction costs intensity of the European patent system.
In the context of the heated software patenting debate in late 2004
these figures were likely kept secret in defense of the software
patenting pratice of the EPO which the European Council proposal wanted
to codify. The only substantial proposal for cost reduction given by the
Roland Berger study is to reduce languages to English only. A survey on
the cost of patenting is based on 253 telephone and postal interviews
among EPO patentees located in Europe, the US and Japan. The study also
tracks inhouse costs of patenting.*

## Study

-   [\"Study on the cost of patenting in Europe\" prepared on behalf of
    the EPO by Roland Berger Market
    Research.](http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_anaylsis_2005_study_en.pdf "wikilink")
    (en, pdf)

Currently the study is made available in English language only although
the EPO features German, French and English as its official languages.

## What politicians believe {#what_politicians_believe}

\"Das Deutsche Patentamt nimmt mit weitem Abstand die geringsten Kosten
f√ºr Patentanmeldungen in Europa. Eine Patentanmeldung kostet 60 Euro.\"
/ \"The German PTO takes the smallest fees for patent applications in
Europe. A patent application costs 60 euro\"

## Economic Majority in software development {#economic_majority_in_software_development}

Conceptual protection rights for software have to be **cheap**, **fast**
and **narrow**. Existing Patent law does not fulfil these requirements.
