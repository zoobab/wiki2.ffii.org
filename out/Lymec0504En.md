*8-10 April 2005 \-- At their Europe-wide congress in Amsterdam, the
Liberal Youth (LYMEC) voted in favor of a resolution for a clear
exclusion of software solutions from patentability, which explicitely
endorses the requests of the FFII.*

## Excerpt: Conclusion of LYMEC {#excerpt_conclusion_of_lymec}

The LYMEC Congress concludes that:

-   LYMEC urges the European Parliament to stand firm against the
    Council of Ministers in case the controversial political agreement
    of May 2004 is confirmed
-   The Bureau should on behalf of LYMEC contact Graham Watson MEP
    (Leader of the ALDE Group) to encourage him to call for all ALDE
    [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") to vote against the patenting of software
-   LYMEC President should sign the Foundation for a Free Information
    Infrastructure (FFII)\'s petition against software patents on behalf
    of LYMEC
-   LYMEC should join forces to FFII\'s campaign \"Software Patents vs.
    Parliamentary Democracy\".
