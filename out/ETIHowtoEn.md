The [consultation document (18
pages)](http://ec.europa.eu/comm/eti/docs/gp_en.pdf "wikilink") - You

documents](http://ec.europa.eu/comm/eti/support_en.htm "wikilink") and
read the [2002 minimum standards for
consultations](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/cnc/2002/com2002_0704en01.pdf "wikilink")
and of course the [interim report of the ETI consultation

            first](http://ec.europa.eu/comm/civil_society/coneccs/start.cfm?CL=en "wikilink").
            This is a non-mandatory NGO register of the EU-Commission.

    publication of your contributions

## Questions I. Transparency and Interest Representation: {#questions_i._transparency_and_interest_representation}

This part will underpin a debate on lobbying activities in the EU

-   Do you agree that efforts should be made to bring greater
    transparency to lobbying?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Do you agree that lobbyists who wish to be automatically alerted to
    consultations by the EU institutions should register and provide
    information, including on their objectives, financial situation and
    on the interests they represent? Do you agree that this information
    should be available to the general public? Who do you think should
    manage the register?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Do you agree to consolidating the existing codes of conduct with a
    set of common minimum requirements? Who do you think should write
    the code?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Do you agree that a new, inclusive external watchdog is needed to
    monitor compliance and that sanctions should be applied for any
    breach of the code?

## Questions II. The Commissions minimum standards for consultation: {#questions_ii._the_commissions_minimum_standards_for_consultation}

This part will provide a structured framework for feedback on the
application of the
[standards](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/cnc/2002/com2002_0704en01.pdf "wikilink")

-   In your view, has the Commission applied the general principles and
    minimum standards for consultation in a satisfactory manner? You may
    refer to the individual standards (provided, for ease of reference,
    in Annex 2).

    examples.

## Questions III.Publication of Data on Beneficiaries of EU Funds {#questions_iii.publication_of_data_on_beneficiaries_of_eu_funds}

This part will launch a debate on the disclosure of data about the
recipients of various EU funds managed by the Commission in partnership
with Member States, notably the Structural Funds and Common Agricultural
Policy.

-   Do you agree that it is desirable to introduce, at Community level,
    an obligation for Member States to make available information on
    beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If so, what information should be required at national level? What
    would be the best means to make this information available (degree
    of information required, period covered and preferred medium)?
