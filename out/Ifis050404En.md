*With a delay of 7 months the results of a government-ordered survey on
software patents and a interoperability study have been published.
Previously the Ministry of Economics had suppressed publication of the
study after protests from Bitkom, the German branch of EICTA, and from
the Ministry of Justice, which resented the interference in its turf. A
partial evaluation showed last month that the study revealed nearly
unanimous animosity against software patents among German companies in
the ICT sector, based on fairly detailed knowledge of the problems. The
full publication of the results from all 1200 participants confirmed
this picture. A study about Interoperability/Patent protection and
Competition recommends improvements with regard to Article 6a.*

-   A large majority of the responding companies fears impairing effects
-   1011 companies (83%) indicate they lack the means and expertise to
    discover whether or not their products infringe on patents
-   902 companies (74%) insist on an interoperability exemption
-   915 companies (75%) fear that due to software patents they won\'t be
    able to effectively compete in the market anymore, only 23 companies
    (2%) anticipate the contrary option, to be able be \"better dominate
    certain markets\", among companies \> 500 employees the ratio is
    29:6, 200-500 employees the ratio is 19:1.
-   On a scale of -3 to 3 \"How will software patents influence the
    innovation ability of your company\" scored -1.5 (negative
    influence, 94% of interviewees responding), and \"Do software
    patents have supporting or inhibiting effects on your programming
    activities now or in the future?\" scored -2.58 (inhibiting, 97.12%
    of respondents). \"How do software patents affect the calculation of
    product prices?\" ranked 2.45 (higher prices, 96.62% responding).
    \"How much use for you has the know-how gain by the publication of
    the software patents by third parties?\" scored -2.41 (no practical
    use, 89.30% responding).
