------------------------------------------------------------------------

FFII co-launched a demo in Paris on Saturday May, 29th. Beside software
patents, the demo was organised against a number of European and French
laws concerning freedom on internet, such as the software patents and
the French *loi sur l\'économie numérique*. Between 1000 and 2000
demonstrator were present. Some contacts have been made (Gibus) with
some people wanting to help FFII, MEP candidate (Alain Lipietz, Greens),
medias (Radio France International but cut on the final broadcast,
I-Television).

So the outcome would be very positive if AFP (Agence France Presse)
hadn\'t curiously given a very low number of participants: 300, even
less than the figure given by the police (700). Some critics referred to
AFP as \"Agence France Propagande\".
