Legal Certainty

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"A more general concern is that laws can never be fixed in perpetuity.
As societies and economies evolve, the details of the law, though
generally not its fundamental principles, need to change. But any
uncertainty about the clarity and fixity of the law adds to the risk of
trade, which as I noted, is reflected in a higher real cost of
capital.\" [2004-02-27 Alan Greenspan: Intellectual property
