*As in many other countries, virtually all companies and associations
from the software sector of Slovenia (e.g. KODA.si) want to pursue
software creation based on copyright only, without interference of the
patent system. The Slovenian information industry ministry shares the
same point of view. Yet Slovenia voted with yes for a patent-extremist
proposal in the European Council in May 2004. Slovenia\'s policy in the
Council seems to be decided by its \"Intellectual Property Office\",
which has been sitting on the administrative council of the European
Patent Office even before Slovenia joined the EU. Support for software
patents also came from Slovenia\'s chamber of industry and commerce,
which took this decision against the opinion of 90% of its member base,
as a later survey shows.*
