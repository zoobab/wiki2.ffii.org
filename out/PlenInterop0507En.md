## Article 2 b c (new) {#article_2_b_c_new}

\|\| number \|\| submitter \|\| recommendation \|\| text \|\| \|\| 19
\|\| JURI 19 \|\| + \|\| \"Interoperability\" means the ability of a
computer program to communicate and exchange information with other
computer programs and mutually to use the information which has been
exchanged, including the ability to use, convert, or exchange file
formats, protocols, schemas, interface information or conventions, so as
to permit such a computer program to work with other computer programs
and with users in all the ways in which they are intended to function.
\|\|

A definition of what exactly interoperability means is good to have.

patented technique is necessary in order to ensure inter-operability
between two different data-processing systems, in the sense that no
equally efficient and equally effective alternative non-patented means
of achieving such inter-operability between them is available, such use
shall not be considered to be a patent infringement, nor shall the
development, testing, making, offering for sale or licence, or
importation of programs making such use of a patented technique be
considered a patent infringement. \| \| 68 \| Mann,
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") \| + \| Member States shall ensure that
use of a patented computer-implemented invention for the development,
production, marketing or use of a computer program product or service
shall not be an infringement if such use is indispensable in order to
achieve inter-operability of a computer program with other computer
programs, unless the patent reads on an adopted standard from a
recognised standard-setting organisation and the patent holder is bound
by a readily enforceable public undertaking, provided in a timely manner
during a standards development process, making a licence for the patent
available as of right on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
and conditions. \| \| 67 \| UEN: Crowley \| - \| 1. Member States shall
ensure that whenever an interface is protected by a patent for a
computer-implemented invention and use of that patent is indispensable
to achieve inter-operability with an independently created computer
program and is in the overriding public interest, licenses authorising
such use are available on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and
conditions. 2. Member States shall ensure that implementing legislation
complies with Article 31 of TRIPS. \| \| 63 \| EPP: Kauppi, Purvis \| -
\| 1. Member States shall ensure that licences are readily available as
of right so as to permit use of a patented computer-implemented
invention on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions when
such use is (a) indispensable for achieving inter-operability between
computer programs, and (b) in the public interest. 2. Without prejudice
to any other remedies that may be applicable under competition law, the
patent shall be unenforceable to the extent that such enforcement
constitutes or contributes to an infringement of Articles 81 and/or 82
of the Treaty. 3. Reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and
conditions, including remuneration, shall in particular have regard to:
(a) the public interest in permitting open access to the patented
invention, (b) the market position of the patent owner if that owner is
also a supplier of a computer program using the patented invention, (c)
the conduct of the patent owner in relation to granting, or refusing to
grant, a license under the patent for such use, (d) the cost of
obtaining necessary licenses from other relevant right holders for the
licensed product, system, network or service, and (e) the generally
prevailing business conditions, including distribution methods, and
licence fees charged for the class of product, system, network or
service requiring inter-operability. 4. No injunctive relief shall be
available in respect of use as referred to in paragraph 1 unless the
potential licensee has refused to enter into a licence for use of the
patented invention. \| \| 25 \| JURI 25 \| - \| 1. Member States shall
ensure that licences are available to use a patented
computer-implemented invention on reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms and conditions when such use is (a) indispensable for achieving
interoperability between computer programs, and (b) in the public
interest. 2. The public interest shall be assumed in cases prohibited by
Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. 3. Reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms and conditions shall in particular have regard to (a) the cost of
obtaining all necessary licenses from other relevant right holders for
the licensed product, system, network or service, (b) the generally
prevailing business conditions applicable to that class of licensed
product, system, network or service, (c) the R&D investments by the
patent holder. \|

Am 50=82=103=124=145=168 is essential to prevent dominant players using
patents to perpetuate their dominance by locking out competition. It
provides that if methods are needed for the sole purpose of
interoperability, they should be available to all. FFII strongly
recommends this solution, which is similar to the amendment Parliament
adopted at first reading.

Am 68 has some attractive features. It gives a strong incentive for
patent owners to submit their technology to standards-making
organisations; this would encourage better technical solutions and much
more complete disclosure of interfaces; and the amendment would protect
such standards from subsequent \"patent ambush\". However, despite the
fine words of the recitals, many of such standards would surely carry
licence fees, which would shut out community-written free software from
being able to interoperate. FFII can therefore only recommend this
approach as a last-option fallback.

The compulsory RAND licence approach of Ams 63, 25 and 67 would in
practice place a very heavy burden on [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), who would
be faced with having to fight long and costly actions in court
proceedings for the opportunity to participate, possibly in each one of
the 25 member states, all under different rules and procedures. This is
unrealistic; doubly so, in such a fast moving field as software. The
RAND compulsory licensing amendments give the illusion of addressing the
problem, but in practice their solution is worthless. FFII cannot
recommend them.

## Recital 20 a (new) {#recital_20_a_new}

\| number \| submitter \| recommendation \| text \| \| 69 \| Mann,
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") \| + \| For the purposes of Article 6a,
\"recognised standard-setting organisation\" means a body, organisation
or institution that produces open standards in the public interest and
in which ongoing standards development occurs on the basis of an open
decision-making procedure accessible to all interested parties in
accordance with objective and reasonable criteria. An open standard is a
technical specification that is available for implementation by all
parties interested in offering standard-compliant implementations. Such
organisation may be constituted at national, transnational or
international level and may be a government agency, private research
institute that acts like a government agency, private volunteer
association or private industry consortium, provided that a
representative proportion of the industry must be involved in the
setting of the standard in a transparent manner. Examples of recognised
international standard-setting organisations include those listed in
Annexes I and II to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council, as amended, the International Organization for
Standardization, the International Electronical Commission and the
International Telecommunication Union, research institutes that act like
government agencies, private volunteer associations such as the Internet
Engineering Task Force, and private industry consortia such as the World
Wide Web Consortium or the Digital Video Broadcasting consortium. \|

## Recital 20 b (new) {#recital_20_b_new}

\| number \| submitter \| recommendation \| text \| \| 70 \| Mann,
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") \| + \| Fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms and conditions for the purposes of Article 6a
means that the consideration for the licence must not be
anti-competitive, exclusionary or excessive, taking into account the
interests of all interested parties including the public interest in
permitting open access to the patented technique for inter-operability
purposes, the need to avoid prohibitive costs in the case of standards
requiring multiple licences from multiple sources and the fact that the
licensor can be expected to benefit already from increased sales of its
product as a result of improved inter-operability. Fees, if any, should
reflect innovative contribution only, and not monopoly rent or the
strategic value or revenues deriving merely from an ability to exclude
rivals from marketing inter-operating products. The licence should be
irrevocable, and the patent owner must not pending negotiations or
dispute resolution apply for injunctive relief against prospective
licensees who declare themselves willing to accept fair, reasonable and
non discriminatory terms. \"Non-discriminatory terms\" means that all
licenses and licensors in a similar situation, including the licensor\'s
own downstream business, if any, must have access to the technology on
the same terms, so as to enable all to compete on a level playing-field,
unless there is an objective justification for any difference and that
difference is proportionate to the difference in circumstances. There
should be no de facto discrimination between different development and
licensing models, and the licensor should therefore offer, at least as
an option, terms and conditions compatible with proprietary as well as
open-source development models. \|
