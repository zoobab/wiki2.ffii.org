*Brussels, 17 February 2005 10.30 \-- 300 demonstrators standing in the
cold outside the Council building in Brussels handed over two letters to
Luxemburg\'s chief Council diplomat Christian Braun which points out
flaws in the processes of the European Council and asks for cautious
reform, with view to the software patent directive, which governments
are trying to push through the Council without a real majority backing
it.*

The following shorter version and a more elaborate [letter of similar
content signed by large Spanish
organisations](http://patents.caliu.info/puntB.en.html "wikilink") were
given to Christian Braun, who came out of the building to meet the
demonstrators.

## Shorter Letter {#shorter_letter}

Dear Council President,

The European Union has become a Banana Republic, and the present
software patent crisis offers you a chance to lead it toward a better
future.

This is, in a nutshell, the message which we, a network of people from
all over Europe, on whom the \"Lisbon Strategy\" is supposed to rely,
have come to deliver to you.

The design faults of the EU Council are well known, but they have rarely
become as widely recognized as in the case of the directive \"on the
patentability of computer-implemented inventions\" (software patent
directive), where the Council has been trying to pass a \"political
agreement\" in absence of a qualified majority of supporting countries,
by forcing countries whose governments or parliaments clearly oppose the
agreement to be counted as supporters.

A few weeks ago a representative of the Luxemburg Presidency told us in
a meeting: \"This is not a Banana Republic\". What he seemed to mean was
something like: \"We can not allow the decisions of this institution to
be disrupted just because they are not representative of the member
states.\"

Fortunately, he was wrong. There is nothing in the regulations of the
European Union that forces the Luxemburg Presidency to insist on
anti-democratic interpretations of the Council\'s rules. These
interpretations seem to serve no other interest than that of the very
diplomats and bureaucrats who wield power in the Council. The planned
European Constitution (I-46) says that the ministerial bureaucrats of
the Council must be accountable to their national parliaments, but given
the manifest anti-democratic spirit of the Council, we must expect that
these provisions of the Constitution will remain empty words, as empty
as the regular speeches of EU Council representatives at present-day
COSAC meetings about parliamentary democracy in the European Union.

In the case of the software patent directive, the Council\'s design
faults are compounded by the design faults of the patent system. The
people who are sitting on the Council\'s Intellectual Property (Patents)
Working Party are the very executive officials who are running the
European Patent Office and who have, through this Office, been setting
rules against the written law without effective oversight from any
parliament. These officials have, together with the Commission, been
trying to impose their \"established practise\" on the EU, and when the
European Parliament, by proposing amendments, tried to correct this
\"established practise\", that fact in itself was enough reason for the
patent officials to ignore the Parliament\'s amendments, to deceive
their ministers by means of contradictory doublespeak, and to hope that
these ministers will shy away from a conflict with their patent
bureuacrats about this arcane subject matter. Thanks to the design
faults and anti-democratic tradition of the Council itself, they
succeded in avoiding a proper 1st reading. Their tactic is to simply
skip this stage and try whether the European Parliament can uphold its
previous position under the unfair requirement of a second reading,
where all abstentions and absences are counted as pro-Council.

As things are currently running, it is not possible for the European
Union to produce fair and legitimate legislation. A long stream of
poorly-crafted, deceptive and illegitimate directives has already come
out of the Council. This state of affairs can not go on. Peaceful change
can occur only, if the people at the head of the Council begin to
discard their banana ideology and instead interpret the rules of the
Council in a democratic spirit.

You can only adopt a common position if there is a count of votes, and
if those votes reflect the actual will of the member states at the time
of votes. If that will is different from May 2004, the blame is to be
put on those who manipulated the session of last May, not on those who
insist on basic democratic principles.

The deeper purpose of Poland\'s push for a return 1st reading in
Parliament is to make sure that the text will come back and Council
officials can not avoid a proper 1st reading. It would of course be much
more straightforward if the Council itself assured this and took
precautions against the kind misrepresentation of member states which we
saw in the May 2004 meeting.

The problems with the software patent directive provide a good
opportunity for cautiously reforming the EU Council and making it
conform to the requirements of a Parliamentary Union, where Council
decisions are transparent and effectively overviewed by national
Parliaments. The only alternative to the Parliamentary Union is a
Consiliar Union, which in Polish reads like \"Soviet Union\". Or we
could call it \"Banana Union\". In any case, this is not the kind of
political system into which we want to integrate our Eastern European
family members, just a decade after they freed themeselves from the
previous tyranny, and it\'s not the kind of political system in which we
and our children want to live in the future.

Please help make Europe a better Union. Please take the 1st step by
retabling the software patent directive as a B-Item.

Yours sincerely
