Mr. van Buitenen became well known internationally as the whistleblower
who exposed large scale corruption throughout the European Commission,
leading to its collective resignation in 1999.

Believing that the situation in the Commission has hardly improved since
then, he founded the party **Europa Transparant**, a European party
dedicated to establishing and safeguarding honesty, integrity, and
openness in the European Decision Making Process. In the European
elections of 2004, they obtained two seats.

Europa Transparant insists on being \"politically neutral\" and argues
that its objectives are desirable by both the political \"Left\" and
\"Right\".

As such, this party won\'t take an official stance on the software
patent issue itself. However, Paul van Buitenen is definitely interested
in investigating the undemocratic and apparently illegitimate behaviour
that the European Commission, demonstrated when it decided to blatantly
ignore the role of the EP.

Everyone who has important **facts** with regards to the misbehaviour of
the European Commission in this process, as well as details on the
active role that the European Patent Office and other influential
parties have played therein, is requested to provide him with detailed
information.

Van Buitenen assistant Ries Baeten is an advisor of FFII.
