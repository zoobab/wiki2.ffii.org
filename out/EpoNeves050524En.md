EPO Conference 1. Speaker João Miguel Neves

Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for inviting me to be here and for taking
the time to, like me, try understanding what the heck is the software
industry about and what\'s at stake in all these discussions on software
patents.

My name is João Neves and I\'m the CEO of Intraneia, an IT support
company. I was asked to come here to share some of the reflections I\'ve
done throughout the years and that resulted in Intraneia\'s present form
(and paying clients).

So the first thing we went through was the pain of accepting that we
don\'t create value. For people that always worked in the IT business,
that\'s a very painful realization. IT doesn\'t add value per se, it
allows the reduction of costs, either through empowering people to do
more or better work with the tools we provide them, or replacing people
with machines through process automatization.

This realization was so strong with us that it defined the name of the
company: Intraneia is a wordplay on the greek word for entrail, meaning
that our job is to work inside the organizations supporting their
business. (Sometimes the organization is a set of companies wanting to
work together.)

Knowing this we started gathering what our potential clients would like
to have and were willing to pay for. Having already clients as
freelancers helped this process. What we found out was that our clients
weren\'t claiming for more software, but for two different things: 1)
the right software, 2) how to use the software they already have.

By the right software, I mean software that will have a positive impact
in their operation (reducing costs or allowing them to do more with the
same resources). They needed someone that either had a broad knowledge
of the software available (and respective services) to help them choose.
They also needed someone that could build and maintain the bridge
between their needs and the what the software does (what we usually call
implementation and support).

Nothing of this is new. After all it\'s something that\'s been known for
a long time as IT consulting. The little difference I failed to mention
before is that the clients needing this are micro, small and medium
enterprises who can\'t afford to deal with the big IT consulting
companies.

It also means that some of the projects are one-time short projects
(sometimes covering less than a week). Some others realize that they
need constant support and we just agree on a regular payment for
services rendered.

Regarding \"how to use the software they already have\", I just want to
say that most software implementations keep disregarding the users. Even
if the interface is supposed to be intuitive, our experience is that
it\'s easy to teach someone to double its efficiency in working with
tools as widespread as office applications. Right know there\'s a huge
population of users that (rightly) mistrust IT professionals. We found
out that hand-holding those users on their workplace for a few minutes
every week or even month helps regain that trust and wins a loyalty we
never expected.

But it\'s not only end-users that mistrust the IT industry. The
well-know failure rates of implementation for an IT project going well
over 70% don\'t help (and some people still wonder why - unfortunately
I\'ve heard repeatedly remarks like \"but it only cost twice the
budget\").

The other reason they mistrust the industry is because of the difference
between their expectations and what they get when they buy software.
They expect the software they bought to be ready to use.

Instead they find out that they need maintenance, sometimes even patches
for it to start to work (or even install), training (that didn\'t come
included and, unlike batteries for a toy, there was no mention of it in
the prospect or in the box of the product).

The more experience buyers mistrust the IT industry for even another
reason: they\'ve had the experience of dealing with legacy applications.
Legacy applications are the zombies of the IT world. They exist and are
kept working because they simply work. These are unsupported
applications, for which maintenance is extremely expensive. Replacing
them is a risk: nobody will give you a guarantee that they\'ll replace,
function by function such an application and that it\'ll work as the old
one did (unless you pay a small fortune that I\'m always willing to
receive).

So either the risk of not replacing them becomes too big (like it
happened with the Y2K bug), and you\'re willing to risk the replacement,
or the zombie will just keep lingering somewhere in the server room (or
closet - depending on the company).

By the way, some technical solutions needed to deal with the legacy
applications problem are prohibited by european copyright law. These
solutions are usually refered to as \"reverse engineering\", even if
there are legal reverse engineering techniques.

So we have a lack of trust that comes from failed projects, a gap of
expectations between users and vendors and the non-existing support for
old apps. This is what we defined as our opportunity.

So our projects had to work, our products and services had to include
training (formal and on-the-job) and support, and we had to have the
possibility of supporting our systems as far in time as needed by our
clients. This defined our mission.

From there on, we had our basic requirements for our processes and
licensing needs.

Our products are based on reliable, well-supported software (where
well-supported means: with information so that we can support it
ourselves). Our most used processes always start with a full audit of
infrastructure and setting up a monitoring system.

As for the licensing needs:

In an industry where 20 years is an era, outdated means 3 years, and you
have computers reaching 10 years and some software programs more than 30
years, we established that we needed vendor independence.

Supporting software over the lifetime of the vendor, means that we need
to be able to modify it and distribute the modified versions to our
clients.

For some reason, our clients insist on using the software, so the
possibility of using the software might be included.

So, these were our needs. But that was not enough. We found out that,
for some reason, our clients weren\'t willing to depend on us (one of
them even insulted us that we just wanted to be like all the other
vendors). So they also wanted the ability to be independent of us.

That\'s one of the reasons why we work mainly with free software, the
only way that we found to go over the gap of mistrust was to give our
clients the freedoms to use, modify (or hire someone to modify), copy
and publish modified versions. Or, as I like to put it to prospective
clients: the freedom to work, vendor independence, the freedom to grow
and the ability to share support costs with others.

This also means that the software we produced is also licensed in the
same terms. I would just like to note that most of the software we
produce is a result of direct client needs. We don\'t produce software
just because we felt it was a good idea and hope somebody will pay for
it.

For some reason we don\'t quite understand, some customers like the idea
that we can support software that they can download gratis from the
Internet.

One of the internal discussions we had was about: we\'re using software
done by others and not paying them for it? To avoid that, we adopted a
rule: a percentage of every contract go to the software projects we used
on that contract. Honesty and rewarding good work are two of the values
of our company.

So, with all this defined, we started collecting contracts (I prefer
collecting contracts to selling them, a steady cash-flow is better than
nice values once in a while). When we receive the next payment, we will
have reached operational break-even, which is impressive for us.

In the meantime, and a bit of the reason I\'m here and having someone
covering for me back at home is all this software patents issue. Until
know we could just use the software and be merry (legally acquired
software, of course). What we found out is that we are at risk of
closing down. Most of the software we present to our customers is made
by others. We also work in a low income market (by IT standards)
depending on highly intelligent and well-payed professionals. Our sucess
depends on automating most tasks so that emergencies can be delt
immediately by very good professionals, preferably before our clients
even notice.

What changes with software patents? We risk being sued, or even worst,
that someone sues one of our clients. In this situation we have a simple
choice, either to defend our client, or to get throw out of the market
because no one will want to deal with a company that implies an
aditional risk to their company.

The problem is that diverting, at this moment, one of our engineers to
reply to a subpoena, means loosing support to hundreds of computers that
need to be payed to a freelancer to be on call. Even with our network of
experts, that costs can go over 1,000/day while that engineer is
analyzing the situation. Either that or diverting the work to the other
full-time engineers, risking to burn them out (which would, in the long
term cause lost customers for degraded service). This can happen even
with software we produce to solve a client\'s problem. And this is not
taking into account any legal costs and the fact that a court case in
Portugal can easily take 3 to 20 years.

I\'ve talked about the basis of my company, the reasons we adopted our
mission and licensing model and what we fear regarding software patents.
