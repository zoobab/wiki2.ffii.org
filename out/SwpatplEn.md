*In Poland nobody except for the local subsidiary of Microsoft and the
Patent Lawyer Association, favors software patents. Major industry
associations such as PRO.pl are against. Even the Polish Patent Office
has maintained its indepences from the European Patent Office practise
and has strongly protested against the EU\'s attempts to impose the EPO
practise on Europe. Yet Poland has come under pressure from the EU
Council to \"vote\" YES for an uncompromisingly pro-patent draft in the
Council which it can not support. Poland spectacularly resisted this
pressure 3 times, while representatives in the European Parliament
worked to have the proposal return to 1st reading.*
