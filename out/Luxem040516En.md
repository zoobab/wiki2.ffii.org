2004-05-16 Luxemburg Gov\'t plans to abstain in Council Vote

It has been said that Luxemburg\'s minister of economy, Mr Henri
GRETHEN, will ask for Parliament\'s Art 6a and maybe some parts of the
amendment to article 2 (definitions of \"technical\", possibly circular,
without \"forces of nature\", as he\'s agreeing only to \"some part\").

It looks like he did not understand that we need more than
\"interoperability\" (this could also mean \[RAND\], it\'s better to say
\"freedom of interoperation\" - be free to interoperate, or \"Free
interoperation\").
