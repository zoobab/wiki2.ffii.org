Software patenting

Microsoft among big businesses seeking to hamper interoperability

Commenting on a hearing today on the software patents directive in the
European Parliaments legal affairs committee, Green MEP for Austria,
Eva Lichtenberger, said:

\"Consumer rights are now coming to the foreground of the debate on
software patenting. On the question of interoperability especially, the
compatibility of devices and programmes made by different producers is
of crucial importance. Consumers often have big problems when trying to
operate programmes on another producers operating system or to combine
devices made by different producers. The problem is that
interoperability needs an interface that enables smooth communication
between different devices and programmes. It is precisely with this
issue that big producers such as Microsoft have spotted a way of
enhancing their market domination position.

For such interfaces software from the different producers is needed,
yet if the interface is protected by patents, it is easy to set the
users fee so high that it becomes practically impossible to use. In this
way consumers are being forced to buy products from only one producer,
thus enhancing the company\'s market-dominating position. There is a
legal battle already underway between the European Commission and
Microsoft to fend off a market-dominating position.

Patents on software and interfaces also pose a huge problem for small
and medium enterprises, because they often need tailored software
solutions. For them, the affordable integration of different software
and hardware components is a matter of survival.

It is absurd that in a world in which commercial barriers are tumbling,
some producers are trying to re-erect them. The Greens call upon all
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") to fight for consumer-friendly solutions and to
frustrate attempts to introduce software monopolies through the back
door using the software patents directive. This directive must
facilitate interoperability  not make it more difficult. The European
Commission and the Council of Ministers should also to support this
objective.\"

Note for editors: The legal affairs committee will hold today (23 May)
an experts audition on the software patents directive in Room ASP 1G2,
from 15.15 to 17.00. The Committees vote on a common position on the
directive will be held on Monday, 20 June.
