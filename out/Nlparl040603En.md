Today, the 3rd of june, the Commission of Economic Affairs of the Dutch
Parliament discussed the vote pro software patents which Minister [
Brinkhorst](LaurensJanBrinkhorstEn "wikilink") cast at the European
Council. In a letter to parliament before the council, Brinkhorst had
stated an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council.
This was misinforming the parliament, so the commission decided the
Netherlands will not undersign the council\'s text before the parliament
will have debated software patents. A majority to withdraw the vote pro
software patents is growing. Secretary of state Van Gennip, who
represented Minister Brinkhorst at the meeting, claimed the
misinformation regarding the agreement between the EP and the Council
was caused by a bad wording due to a \"word processing error\".

Also present was Europarlementarian [ Johanna
Boogerd](JohannaBoogerdEn "wikilink"), who stated that the European
Parliament\'s crucial amendments were thrown out of the text the Council
accepted, notably the definition of \"technical\". MP Van Dam from the
!PvdA noted that the exclusion of \"computer programs as such\" from
patentability did not exclude \"computer programs executed by a
computer\". The argument from Van Gennip that retracting the Dutch vote
would not change anything anyway, was met with depreciation from the
parliamentarians. She did admit that although unusual, it was not
impossible for the Netherlands to do this.
