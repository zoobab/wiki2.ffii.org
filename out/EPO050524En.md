The European Patent Office (EPO) and the Foundation for a Free
Information Infrastructure (FFII) invite speakers to talk on the
patentability of computer-implemented innovations in the context of
small businesses

### rough report - some keywords {#rough_report___some_keywords}

#### 1st board {#st_board}

##### panelist #1: Mr Joao Neves, Intraneia {#panelist_1_mr_joao_neves_intraneia}

-   no value-added business, but support (though we have already created
    software and we still do, we consider ourselves being a support
    company)
-   create sw that really helps
-   consulting mainly small companies
-   mainly small projects

##### panelist #2: Mr Daniel Doll-Steinberg, Tribeka {#panelist_2_mr_daniel_doll_steinberg_tribeka}

-   we are inventive
-   50 employees
-   7 million UK-pounds invested by investors who where interested in a
    guarantee provided by swpat
-   7 years development - no product yet, hence swpat necessary to
    guarantee return-of-investment
-   filed 3 patents
-   patents provide confidence
-   patents provide guarantee
-   big companies buy [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") because of patents
-   Internal revenue service uses patents as an indicator of R&D.
-   Patents allow competing with other blocks (China, India, US, Japan).
-   Europe has innovations, but it\'s always the US that comercializes
    it.
-   software should of course not be patented, but the underlying
    processes
-   software is part of mental world
-   lawmaker should not decide for or against a certain business model -
    hence we need swpat to allow ours
-   We need cheaper patents for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), cheaper dispute
    resolution.

##### panelist #3: Mr Andrea Nikolai, T6 {#panelist_3_mr_andrea_nikolai_t6}

-   SME are 98% in number and 50% of GDP
-   There\'s a digital divide between [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and large
    companies.
-   There are for models for software: Software projects, Software
    publishing, Software subscription, Open Source Software

#### 2nd board {#nd_board}

##### panelist #4: Mr Hintjens, iMatix Corporation {#panelist_4_mr_hintjens_imatix_corporation}

-   Programmer for more than 20 years, doing software R&D.
-   Owner/founder of a highly innovative infrastructure building
    company.
-   Ideas are cheap. Every smart person has brilliant ideas all the
    time.
-   iMatix is building middleware for a 200,000 people bank, that has to
    support 100,000 transactions/second.
-   The world lives and dies on cheap software.
-   Copyright is strong protection and has worked well for iMatix.
-   Patents are legal instruments used to attack innovative
    [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink").
-   If you approve software patents, you will destroy SME innovation and
    break our economies.

##### panelist #5: Mr Häkon Wium Lie, CTO, Opera Software {#panelist_5_mr_häkon_wium_lie_cto_opera_software}

Founded in 1995. They had VC funding. He joined four years later. Opera
has one product: Internet Browser. The most innovative technology they
have is on small screen rendering. Opera is against software patents.
Opera has software patents in the US for defensive reasons.

##### panelist #6: David Sant, European Patent Office {#panelist_6_david_sant_european_patent_office}

-   patents are indispensible guarantee and incentive
-   innovation breeds innovation via patents
-   patents balance public vs. private interests
-   p\. provide jobs
-   EPO private studies: majority of registrants are
    [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")
-   one patent registration costs 30000 EUR average, but only 13% go to
    EPO
-   [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") are always at disadvantage
-   table comparing patents, copyright, no right

` my comment: implying FOSS would be "no right"`\
` my comment: why does copyright disclose anything in software? and why do patents do (no swpat)`

-   copyright: change a small part to work around
-   patents are wide protection, while copyright is narrow
-   Question to the audience: \"Why should differences in scope make
    patent protection per se objectionable?\"
-   Question to the audience: two categories of CII: ABS patentable, but
    ??? (real swpat) not - where\'s the difference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simon Gentry was not happy with the suggestion to use CAI (-Aided) for
patentable inventions and software patents for the things nobody wants
to patent.
