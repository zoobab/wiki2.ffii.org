*4 June 2005 \-- In view of efforts by leading members of the European
Parliament to reinstate strict limits on patentability, the ministerial
patent officials who control patent policies in the EU Council are
pressing the Parliament to refrain from stating its position and instead
accept a hasty \"compromise\", so that software patentability can be
rubberstamped by both institutions together without further
negotiations, right after the Parliament\'s vote in July.*

According to information available to the FFII, the administrators of
the European Patent Office are secretly preparing to interfere in the
European Parliament\'s Second Reading on software patentability.

The Council\'s \"Working Party on Intellectual Property (Patents)\"
consists of the very ministerial patent officials who run the European
Patent Office and national patent office. This group met on Friday the
3rd of June in Brussels in order to prepare a position paper on the
European Parliament\'s planned [amendments](http:Juri0505 "wikilink").

The Council\'s ministerial patent officials have for two years been
failing to respond to the European Parliament\'s objections to software
patentability and instead produced a [deceptive
paper](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/ "wikilink")
which was [adopted](http://wiki.ffii.org/Cons050307En "wikilink") by the
Council in March of this year against the Council\'s rules of procedure
and without a qualified majority.

The strategy of the ministerial patent officials was thus to push their
old approach through a new Parliament under tightened time constraints
and heightened majority requirements. The Parliament had only 3 months
to come to a counter-position which must be supported by an absolute
majority of component members. I.e. absent members count as pro-Council.
The only chance for keeping negotiations open is for the Parliament to
reaffirm the position of its first reading on July 6th 2005. Before
this, the Legal Affairs Committee must vote. This vote is scheduled for
June 21st.

The Council presidency now suddenly believes that this schedule is not
yet tight enough. The conclusion of a meeting of Council diplomats in
late May was that a compromise with the Parliament must be reached
within the Parliament\'s second reading, before the Parliament has a
chance to form its own position. According to reports from the meeting
which have been leaked to FFII from various ministerial sources, the
Council wants to reach a quick consensus and avoid a conciliation
procedure.

Various delegations, including those from Sweden, Germany and the
Netherlands, have already signalled that they can not accept any
substantial amendments. E.g. for the German delegation, a [definition of
\"technology\" by \"forces of nature\"](http:JuriTech0505En "wikilink")
is unacceptable and [program claims](http:JuriProgklm0505En "wikilink")
are essential. Only cosmetic amendments such as those of [Klaus-Heiner
Lehne](http:KlausHeinerLehneEn "wikilink") are acceptable to them.

As usually, the patent officials disregard the resolutions that were
passed by their respective parliaments. The negotiations are secret, and
usually the positions of individual countries are not published.

The \"Intellectual Property Working Party\" has convened on Friday the
3rd and is expected to present a conclusion to the European Parliament
on the 14th, just one week before the Parliament\'s committee votes.

Hartmut Pilch of FFII expects: \"The discourse of many Committee members
will then be strongly influenced by \"political\" considerations, with
\"realism\" and \"compromise\" being the buzzwords and the achievement
of a clear and adequate law becoming a secondary objective at best.\"

In the [concluding conversation with EPP shadow rapporteur Piia-Noora
Kauppi MEP at the FFII\'s conference on
Wednesday](http:Konf050601En "wikilink"), Pilch said the Council is
hastily meeting because, as realists, they are afraid of the enormous
force of a clear counter-position from the European Parliament, and
therefore are trying to derail the process. \"Realistically speaking,
truth is a strong weapon. So let\'s use it\", Pilch concluded.

Moments of truth will have to happen in some national parliaments next
week.

a [separate report](http:Cons050527En "wikilink").
