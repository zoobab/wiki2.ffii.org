# How to Act against the Council\'s Fishy Patent Tactics {#how_to_act_against_the_councils_fishy_patent_tactics}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FFII is trying to mobilise its supporters to contact politicians and
media to prevent the Council decision and/or get the Parliament\'s
Restart project on track. Supporters are also asked to support the
campaign by web banners and/or strike pages. This is being organised by
the Webdemo Team (fish0501-help at ffii org). In case you want to help,
here are some entry points. By its surprise tactic of inserting an
A-item in the last minute, the Council/Commission of course makes this
difficult.

## To Do {#to_do}

-   blasum: write to all our supporters (not only german ones, but the
    german template can be used)
-   list pointers to people to whom supporters could write, with
    explanations. These pointers should be listed on this page
    (FishDemo0501En). Many already exist.
-   translate/update the frontpage letters for various languages. Do
    this by downloading the source from
    <http://www.ffii.org/index.en.html> or another language, editing it
    and sending it to fish0501-help at ffii org (installed in
    /var/www/adm/etc/aliases.src/)
