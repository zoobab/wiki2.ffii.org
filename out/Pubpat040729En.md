## Outline

-   Public Patent Foundation achieved a major success by getting the
    USPTO to agree to reexamine the Microsoft FAT patents.
-   This is unusual, given that the FAT patents are from the 1980s
-   This does not necessarily mean that the USPTO believes that
    Pubpat\'s prior art is very strong, but it could mean that.
-   Pubpat representatives replied evasively about his stand on whether
    software patentability is compatible with the goal of \"sound patent
    policy\", which Pubpat endorses
