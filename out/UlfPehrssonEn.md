SUMMARY: Ulf Petrusson - Structural transformation towards license-based
R&D-structures

Is publicly organised and funded research in Europe going to be
transformed into license-based structures? And is it so that in the
process it has become important to transform knowledge, not only into
assets, but also into commodities? The impact of information and
communication technologies is especially interesting. Today the usage of
databases in research is so extensive in certain fields that one could
talk about the emergence of virtual laboratories. Use of ICTs makes
it possible to govern information in a more organised way.

Commodification requires awareness of the creative origin and
contractual claims

Commodification requires contractual control and license structures

Commodification requires a multilayered program for governance of
knowledge

Commodification requires a knowledge and information-oriented
infrastructure

Privatisation of knowledge - a commercial ethos in the research field?

The necessity of strength/market power to establish structures for
cross-licensing?

Centralisation and specialisation of public research?

R&D-networks based on multi-layered governance structures - small actors
are captured as knowledge providers without control? Policy making in
structural captivity  a legal theoretical approach

Policymakers structurally captured to control intangibles  result of
global competition & IPRs?

Importance of a communicative and pluralistic understanding of IPR.

Awareness of property claims / intellectual property law as a façade for
self assertive interests

Policy-makers as a cog in a communicative machinery that structurally
transforms societies

Designing IP & IPR´s concepts as structural tools  the regulation level

Designing and using IP & IPR´s concepts as structural tools  the
contractual levels
