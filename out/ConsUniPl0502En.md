*In a unilateral statement to be added to the minutes of the Council\'s
Common Position, the Polish government stress its rejection to the
Council\'s software patent agreement (and implicit support for the
European Parliament\'s approach). The text explains that the current
directive draft only pretends to exclude software from patentability but
in fact makes the doors wide open.*

-   It should be noted that the Polish word for \"computer-implemented
    inventions\" reads like \"inventions realised with help of a
    computer\" and has thus a somewhat different nuance, which allows
    this word to refer to something different from software.

## The Text {#the_text}

Statement by Poland

Poland having regard to the necessity of further work on the draft
directive in order to strengthen legal certainty and to protect economic
interests, particularly of small and mediumsized enterprises, as well as
activities in research and technological development notes, despite the
reservations submitted, the fact of reaching political agreement at the
18 May 2004 meeting of the Competitiveness Council concerning a common
position leading up to a second reading of the draft directive.

Poland supports the goals that guided the preparation of the directive,
especially the need for:

-   improvement of the transparency and legal certainty of the
    protection of computerimplemented inventions, which is particularly
    important for economic decisions taken by natural and legal persons
    active in the area of information technology,
-   harmonisation of diverse practices in the said area in the EU Member
    States,
-   preclusion of the possibility of patenting non-technical inventions
    (ones not pertaining to the domain of technology), inventions
    lacking the characteristics of innovativeness, business methods and
    computer programs as such,
-   development of an environment conducive to innovations in industry
    and computer science.

Poland states, however, that several key provisions included in the text
of the proposal resulting from the Council meeting on 18 May 2004 do not
meet her expectations.

Poland thus firmly favours unequivocal legal instruments guaranteeing
that computerimplemented inventions will be patentable but a computer
program or its fragment will not beyond any doubt be patentable. Poland
therefore informs that she will support the draft directive on its
second reading at the Council only if introduced amendments prohibit the
patenting of computer programs.

In its current form, the draft directive does not meet Poland\'s
expectations because:

1.  although it appears (in Art. 4) to disallow considering a computer
    program to be a patentable invention, in fact (by virtue of Art.
    5.2) it provides for the possibility of introducing patent
    protections relating to computer programs as such whenever there are
    more protections concerning the object of the patent submission,
2.  it states that also computer programs may be treated as
    computer-implemented inventions for they belong in the area of
    technology, and are thus bound by the provision of Art. 27 of the
    TRIPS Agreement. Because of this inadmissibly broad interpretation
    of the TRIPS Agreement, the draft directive contradicts Art. 52 (2)
    and (3) of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents,
    according to which computer programs as such are not considered as
    inventions,
3.  it recognizes simple use of a computer as \"technical\", which is
    contradictory to the essence and understanding of an invention,
    adopted both in the Convention on the Grant of European Patents, and
    in the Polish legal system,
4.  it does not ensure the protection of interoperability, admissible on
    the basis of Art. 30 of the TRIPS Agreement. The draft directive
    allows for reverse engineering and decompilations analogically to
    the provisions of the directive on the protection of computer
    programs by means of copyright. While the exceptions provided for in
    that directive are sufficient in the context of copyright, Art. 6 of
    the draft directive does not actually enforce interoperability on a
    patent holder.

Moreover, the draft directive contains what Poland views as a number of
legal incoherencies, many vague provisions and terms explained with
notions whose definitions are not found in the proposal. The definitions
of a \"field of technology\", or of \"technical\", are a case in point.
The proposal lacks a clear statement that the programming of computers,
computer networks or other devices, is not a field of technology.

The preamble (point 8) states that a goal of the directive is to prevent
divergent interpretations of the provisions of the Convention on the
Grant of European Patents. This is to be served through harmonisation of
the national legal arrangements regulating the patentability of
computerimplemented inventions. This is provided for both in point 5 of
the preamble and in Art. 10 that directly obliges the Member States to
enact statutory law, as well as executive and administrative
regulations, indispensable to the implementation of the directive\'s
provisions. This contradicts point 18 of the preamble, where it is
claimed that the legal protection of such inventions does not call for
the creation of a separate code of law replacing national law, and the
directive itself merely makes the legal status quo clear.

A detailed analysis of the directive\'s provisions leads to the
conclusion that there is a need for the introduction into national law
of a new definition of a patentable computer-implemented invention. The
draft directive defines a computer-implemented invention in such a way
that every program installed in a computer and executed in it becomes an
invention. On the other hand, when defining technical input, the draft
directive does not sufficiently distinguish between technical and
non-technical features of an invention. Art. 2b and 3 suggest that
patentability will be enjoyed by an invention whose contribution to
knowledge resides only in the non-technical part.

In many cases it is necessary to underscore in the text of the directive
the technical character of an invention. It is therefore advisable to
explain that computer-implemented inventions should be protected only
when limited to products such as programmed technical equipment or a
technical operation executed with this equipment.

Poland is also of the opinion that in view of the highly difficult legal
issues involved, further work on the document should be assisted by a
document including examples of inventions that will enjoy patentability
and ones that will not. Those examples will constitute an interpretation
aid for rulings on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.
Poland deems it necessary as well to include in the document proposed
above a preliminary assessment of possible legal and financial
consequences caused by the implementation of the directive.

In conclusion, Poland wishes to emphasise that the goals that underlie
the work on the directive can only be achieved when it establishes
explicit legal instruments making it impossible to patent computer
programs or their fragments, while enabling computer-implemented
inventions to enjoy patentability. Poland will steadfastly strive, at
later stages of the legislative work, for these conditions to be met.
She will do so in the conviction that a proper settlement of the issues
related to patenting computer-implemented inventions will become an
important factor in enhancing the competitiveness of the European
economy and in strengthening of the European Research Area.
