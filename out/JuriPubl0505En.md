## Article 5.1/2 a (new) {#article_5.12_a_new}

123 = 141 = 143 \|\|  Kudrycka and Zwiefka; Bertinotti; Kauppi; Ortega
\|\| ++ \|\| Member States shall ensure that the distribution and
publication of information, in whatever form, can never constitute
direct or indirect infringement of a patent.  \|\| \|\| 134 \|\| Szenja
\|\| + \|\| Member States shall ensure that the production, processing,
dissemination and publication of information in any form cannot be the
basis of direct or indirect breach of patent law, even if patented
technical apparatus is used to this end. \|\| \|\| 135 \|\| Frassoni,
Lichtenberger \|\| + \|\| Member States shall ensure that the
production, handling, processing, distribution and publication of
information in any form can never constitute a patent infringement,
either direct or indirect, even if a technical device is used for this
purpose. \|\|

Freedom of publication, as stipulated in Art 10 ECHR, can be limited by
copyright but not by patents. Patent rights are broad and unsuited for
information. These amendments do not make any patents invalid, rather
they limit the ways in which a patent owner can enforce his patents.

122 = 123 = 141 = 143 are more balanced than 134 and 135 (the latter are
more or less reprises from the first reading, the others are compromises
by limiting themselves only to the distribution and publication of
information).
