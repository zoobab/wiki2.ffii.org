Jonathan Schwartz has been the president of Sun Microsystems since
2004-04. Schwartz has personally applied for business method patents on
behalf of Sun and declared in his blog: \"I believe in IP. \...
Copyright, Trademarks, Patents, I believe in them all. \...\" and
asserted that patents must be available for \"all endeavors from drugs
to academic work\". After Sun was badly hit by Kodak\'s patent lawsuit,
Schwartz immediately licensed the patents for 90 million USD. Later
Schwartz wrote that patents, as granted in the US, are giving him the
creeps, and that non-obviousness standards should be higher.
