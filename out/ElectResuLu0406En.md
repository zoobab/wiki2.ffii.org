## Seats

\|\| CSV \|\| 3 \|\| (+1) \|\| \|\| LASP (Socialists) \|\| 1 \|\| (-1)
\|\| \|\| DP(Democrats) \|\| 1 \|\| (-0) \|\| \|\| Greens \|\| 1 \|\|
(+0) \|\|

Even though the greens gained 4% they did not get a second seat :(

For the greens it will be Claude Turmes as before. We may have hope for
Goebels to represent LSAP (good) CSV will probably be Ms.Lulling
(already in contact) and 2 new ones. For DP Ms. POLFER Lydie is
probable.

As Luxembourg had national elections too the people will be decided
later.
