### Yesterday, was held the First Edition of the European Inventor of the Year  FFII was there {#yesterday_was_held_the_first_edition_of_the_european_inventor_of_the_year_ffii_was_there}

-   The first edition of the \"European Inventor of the Year\", jointly
    organised by the European Commission and the European Patent Office,
    was held at the Hotel Le Plaza in with the gala dinner and awards
    ceremony taking place at the Autoworld Museum on 3 May. Though being
    not officially invited, FFII came to attend this patented event.
    There were apparently no other association such as FFII advocating
    for copyright, interoperability and open standards. Only developers
    and inventor linked to important firms as IBM or Nokia, IPR
    specialised lawyers and of course, a lot of members of the EPO.
    Unsurprisingly, European [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") were clearly not
    represented.

-   The emphasis of the first-day conferences was put on the challenges
    and the economic potential of patenting in Europe. Of course,
    patents were presented as the unique solution to protect inventions
    in the context of free market. Of course, patents were presented as
    the real panacea to promote competitive economy and support
    innovation in Europe. The polemic software patent case was sort of
    eluded. It looks like an \"autocelebration\" of the EPO illegal
    practices.

-   Concerning the awards ceremony to which we couldnt attend because
    it was to expensive, only nominees belonging to industrial groups
    having registered patents to the EPO were represented. That is to
    say, the European inventor of the year was also necessarily the one
    who have registered a high number of inventions to the EPO. We
    finally succeeded into interviewing one of the nominees, the
    non-European Charles E. Perkins, presently working for Nokia.

-   To conclude we could renamed this EPO event as the Patented European
    Inventor of the Year. The patent ideology was omnipresent, other
    associations such as FFII promoting an alternative model of
    competitive economy were simply not invited and nominees for the
    European of the Year belonged necessarily to industrial groups
    closely linked with the EPO. Possibilities of open dialogue were
    unfortunately rare.
