*The largest European mobile phone and consumer electronics companies
are using offensive patenting strategies and deploying significant money
and manpower to into intransparent and deceptive lobbying (astroturfing)
for extension of patentability by EU laws. In doing so, they have
significantly undermined democracy and made the EU a worse place to live
in. We call on you to avoid buying from these companies and try to list
alternatives.*

    \-- Members of the board and leaders of the patent department speak

    licensing fees even within the Siemens group, so as to improve the
    incentive effect. Siemens no longer has the image of the \"peaceful
    giant\", litigation fees have soared by 100% in the last 10 years,
    patent department with 200 employees is one of the most
    profit-oriented \"patent law companies\". \"We are especially
    looking for patents that can not be circumvented or are likely to
    become part of future standards\".
-   2001 DE Dr. Horst Fischer, patent department head of Siemens since
    1994, declares in an interview with Siemens Webzine that patents are
    \"potent weapons\" and that software patents will play an
    increasingly great role for the strategy of Siemens: \"Software
    patents even account for an increasingly large share of our
    portfolio. Some groups, such as Automation & Drives and Medical
    Solutions, have launched special initiatives for such patents.
    Initial registration of these property rights is increasingly
    occurring in the U.S., because the legal framework for software
    patents is very advanced there. This trend is even more pronounced
    in the case of patents for \"business models\", in other words,
    patents for electronic business solutions. Here we\'ve set up a
    worldwide coordination and counseling center.

## Why Software Patents are Directed Against Consumers {#why_software_patents_are_directed_against_consumers}

Patents are broad monopoly rights that intrude much more deeply into
people\'s freedom than copyright or trademarks. Whereas traditional
patents were a weapon in a warfare between largescale industrial
organisations with expensive science laboratories, with software
patents, the normal office and living room computer is targetted. This
strengthens monopolies in areas where they do no good at all, reduces
R&D investments and artificially raises the prices.

    software patents.

## What are the Patent Bullies? {#what_are_the_patent_bullies}

At the [ [Patents2Innovation](Patents2Innovation "wikilink")
website](Patents4InnovationEn "wikilink") you can find an impressive
list of hightech companies who allegedly are rallying behind the most
primitive kind of propaganda. In many cases the companies listed there
do not really stand behind the campaign and have just been listed
because they are members of a member association of [
EICTA](SwpateictaEn "wikilink"). To confirm their position, we need to
contacted them one by one .

Mobile phone companies do not need software patents in order to be
productive. Copyright and business secret are more than enough, also for
embedded software. This has been testified by many of the big players in
the industry, such as Oracle, Adobe, Cisco, Autodesk, Ilog. But some of
the big companies have nourished huge patent departments which hoard
thousands of broad and trivial patents on calculation rules and business
models every year and crosslicense these among each other. For a new
entrant, the patent royalties due for implementation of telephony
standards in a telephone add up to more than the price of the phone, and
many patents aren\'t licensable at all. Thus competition is effectively
restricted.

In such companies, the patent departments usually employ 100s of people
and engage in offensive *patent strategies*. This includes lobbying for
software patents and other patent legislation that helps strengthen
their oligopolistic power.

-   [ Economic Studies](SwpatsiskuEn "wikilink") show that software
    patents have lead to a decrease on R&D spending and increase in
    litigation spending even among the patent bullies themselves.

## Whom to Avoid {#whom_to_avoid}

-   The Big European Patent Bullies: [ Nokia](SwpatnokiaEn "wikilink"),
    [ Siemens](SwpatsiemensEn "wikilink"), [
    Ericsson](SwpatericssonEn "wikilink"), [
    Alcatel](SwpatalcatelEn "wikilink"), [
    Philips](SwpatphilipsEn "wikilink"). Each of these has a large
    patent departments with hundreds of staff, several among them
    involved full-time in lobbying for software patent legislation.

## From Whom To Buy {#from_whom_to_buy}

-   European mobile phones: [ Sagem](SagemEn "wikilink")
-   non-european mobile phones: Motorola, Samsung, Panasonic \...

To be investigated further.

## To Do {#to_do}

-   create project fairtech with mailing lists
-   collect more materials on buying alternatives
-   cooperate with more groups
-   create nice web portal with campaign banners etc, leaflets etc
-   research the patent portfolios of the patent bullies, possibly ask
    universities to provide some independent expertise based on our
    questions
-   research which companies really stand behind the patent bullies\'
    campaigns
