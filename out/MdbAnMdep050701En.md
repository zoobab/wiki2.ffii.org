*July 1st, 2005 \-- Today before the start of the summer break the
german Bundestag has expectedly expressed mistrust to chancellor
Schröder. At the same time the experts for the software patent directive
from the german parliamentary groups, namely Rainer Funke (FDP), Dr.
Günter Krings (CDU), Jerzy Montag (Grüne/B90), Jörg Tauss (SPD), are
addressing their colleagues in the European Parliament with a joint
letter in which they express their mistrust against the council version
of the software patents directive. This is further understandable as an
objection to the activities of the german minister of justice Mrs.
Zypries who had written a letter to the european parlamentarians that
was contrary the resolution of the Bundestag and contrary the normal
procedures.*

## Summary

The !MEPs inform about the main idea behind the Bundestag resolution:

-   Protection of software through Copyright, not patent law
-   A sharply-excluding definition of \"technical\" based upon the
    established German federal court (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) rulings
    (i.e. with controllable forces of nature as part of the problem
    solution)
-   Exclusion of trivial patents
-   Exclusion of program claims (i.e. amendment of article 5.2)
-   Full interoperability privilege
-   Reliable legal protection of interests of small and medium sized
    enterprises
