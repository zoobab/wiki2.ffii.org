# Chilling Effects of Spamcop on Grassroots Movement {#chilling_effects_of_spamcop_on_grassroots_movement}

## Purpose

-   Dealing with Spamcop
    -   -   getting ffii off blacklists
        -   pointing out problems at ffii
        -   pointing out problems at spamcop

Much of this work is unlikely to find voluntaries to do it.

## Why FFII is always blacklisted {#why_ffii_is_always_blacklisted}

When we send out mail to our supporters, i.e. a group of about 50,000
people who have opted in and can easily opt out by responding to the
mail, we always find that there is a group of about between 0,01% and
0,1% of respondents who do not read our mail but just denounce us at
Spamcop.net.

Although we have taken all the precautions, people of this kind will
always exist.

Spamcop.net offers us a remedy: we can prove one by one that these
people are wrong.

That means for each mailing to our supporters, we have to pay an
employee to spend a few hours clearing us of guilt. Depending on how you
calculate fees for staff, this might well correspond to a burden in the
range of a few 1000 eur per month.

The false accusers do not have to fear any sanctions. Even if a system
was implemented to make them lose credibility with Spamcop, that would
only marginally affect the situation, because the false accusers are
recruited primarily from people who do not read documentation and are
not willing to learn much, and the supply of such people is infinite.

The opinions of the 99,9% of our recipients are not taken into
consideration by Spamcop.

## Influence of the Spamcop Tax on the Political Landscape {#influence_of_the_spamcop_tax_on_the_political_landscape}

It is fairly easy for a movement that is backed by large companies to
deal with burdens like that of Spamcop.

Creating a well-financed concentrated structure is much more difficult
for grassroot movements that are not supported by large companies or not
supported by companies at all.

## Consequences

For the time being the consequence should be that politically conscious
!ISPs and users refrain from using Spamcop.

In the long run, the algorithms used in Spamcop should be improved so as
to take political movements (and not only the typical commercial
spammer) into account.
