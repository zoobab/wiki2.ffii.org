A new interesting model is presented in the German scientific paper
\"Wirtschaftsinformatik\"

Beimborn, D., Hoppen, N.: A simulative Approach to Determing the
Economic Efficiency of software Patents, in: Wirtschaftsinformatik
46(2004), S. 50-60.

Both are researchers from Frankfurt, Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik.
It is a non-partisan approach, which is quite uncommon in this field.

It is a report from ongoing research.

## Comments

(Note: only few people have access to the paper, so we can just quote
comments here)

[ André Rebentisch](AndreRebentischDe "wikilink"):

I am not convinced by their model, however it is worth a read. It IS
very difficult to determine the effects of patents on innovation and
model it.

[ Reinier Bakels](ReinierBakelsEn "wikilink"):

This is the most complicated economic modeling endeavour I have seen so
far. I am sceptic about such modeling because it starts with
simplification and subsequently **very** detailed conclusions are drawn.
