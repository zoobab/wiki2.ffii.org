------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A patent lawyer who was hired by Scania with the task of promoting
software patenting within the company, based on the assumption that this
is the future to which the company must adjust. Mr Egrelius is also a
member of Swedish Enterprise software patent working group together with
Mrs. Therese Kreuer and Mr. Walo von Greyerz (former Ericsson, now Bird&
Bird associate). Mr. Egrelius\' job at Scania depends on a growth in
importance of patents for the automobile industry. Thus Egrelius has
been rallying the automobile industry for the cause of software
patentability and acted as their representative in lobbying the EU
Council and the European Parliament since 2003 or earlier.*

## Argumentation for Program Claims {#argumentation_for_program_claims}

-   [ program claim arguments](DilabProg04En "wikilink"): Egrelius has
    been vehemently promoting program claims, saying that Scania needs
    control over an imaginary future market where new truck
    functionalities are realised by inserting a new program disk into an
    existing automobile motor, insisting that neither copyright nor
    pursuit as indirect patent infringment can be enough for this
    market. Although this text takes an example from a small Swedish
    company, it is mostly Egrelius who is pushing this kind of argument
    in Sweden.
