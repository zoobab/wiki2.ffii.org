*The SW Patent Fairy Tale \~ by Cristian Miceli*

*Groklaw, the award-winning legal news and research website, has
published an article by Cristian Miceli, a UK based IT lawyer, which
takes a look at software patent issues in 2005 and addresses the
question of whether software patents are beneficial or
counterproductive.*

As an attorney, Miceli says he believes in intellectual property rights,
and \"as part of this, I see the benefits that patents can potentially
bring in certain sectors. However, as one law professor recently
commented, \'good policy does not just consist of \"more rights\"; it
consists of maintaining a balance between the realm of property and the
realm of the public domain\'Â”.
