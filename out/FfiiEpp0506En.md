*18th June 2005 \-- FFII has published a discussion paper which attempts
to help parliamentarians of the European People\'s Party (EPP) to open
up a discussion. The paper \"Software Patents: How to achieve the aims
of the \'Common Position\' - Options and Compromise Potential\",
addresses popular misconceptions on the software patents directive,
misconceptions unfortunately also found within the EPP.*

The \'Common Position\' of May 2004 is often presented as a way to
prevent patents on software and business methods. The FFII agrees with
this stated aim of the \'Common Position\', and shows in the paper that
the content is radically different from the packaging. The paper also
explains how computer tomography can be patented under the \"Ten
Clarifications\", i.e. under the essential rules which represent the
common sense of patent law in Europe that the European Parliament
reestablished in 2003, and which have since then been subject to
untruthful attacks by patent lawyers of large corporations such as
Siemens.

The paper is already available in four languages, further translations
are under way. FFII calls on its supporters to carefully read this paper
and gain more friends for it within EPP during the upcoming two weeks in
the final run-up to the plenary vote of 5th of July.
