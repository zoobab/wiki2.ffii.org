# Letter to National Parliaments {#letter_to_national_parliaments}

Dear Members of National Parliaments,

The European Law making system has given less and less power to
democracy

Council out of democractic control

Irish Presidency

Bolkestein directive II

Luxembourg Presidency behaviour

Lack of transparency, sheduling the directive at the last moment of the
Council agenda (the same day)

Lack of transparency regarding the position of several ministers, none
of them has really published their position to open it to the critics.

Position of several ministers overturned by Parliamentary vote in
several countries ()

Therefore, we enccourage you to start a debate on this debate of society
(our society is the information society) on this issue urgently, since
the decision making in the Council will probably happen after July 04.
