------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A court in Tokyo ruled that Microsoft\'s main competitor in word
processing software, Ichitaro, must be taken off the market, because it
allows users to drag a help icon onto a to-be-explained function. This
method is covered by a patent of Japan\'s Nr. 1 electronics giant
Matsushita (also known as \"National Panasonic\") who took Ichitaro
creator Justsytem to court over it.*

The dispute centered on the way that a help function works in the
Ichitaro and Hanako software. The way the software presents information
violates a
[patent](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/txt/jp/2803236/ "wikilink") which
was filed by Matsushita in 1989 and granted by the Japanese Patent
Office in 1998. The patent broadly covers any device or program that
allows a user to click on a help icon and then drag this help icon onto
a function that needs to be explained.

Japan\'s rules for software patent granting are basically the same as
those of the US and of the European Patent Office. All three conform to
a [ Trilateral Standard](SwpatuseujpEn "wikilink"). Matsushita regularly
files its software patents at the European Patent Office as well, and we
have yet to find out whether a European version of this patent exists.
Possibly this can be done using the patent family search facility at
<http://www.depatisnet.de/>.

Matsushita\'s role in Japan is similar to that of General Electrics in
the US or Siemens in Germany. Matsushita has climbed to the top of the
[software patenting
statistics](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/stats/ "wikilink") at the
European Patent Office. For several years, Matsushita has been Nr. 1,
Microsoft Nr. 2. Matsushita probably has, like most companies of this
size, concluded a patent alliance with Microsoft. Matsushita has
recently also been named as a signator company on some lobbying calls
for software patents in Europe.
