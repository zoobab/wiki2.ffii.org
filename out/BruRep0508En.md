*Erik is coming to Brussels at the end of the month. There\'s a lot to
set up so that we can operate there.*

-   letter to sponsors to support Erik
-   erjos: coming to Brussels on 24th, clarify what he will be doing
    (see ideas about moving more of FFII to Brussels)
-   try to establish this as a model for a few more activists
-   FFII fax2pdf machine seems to be working again (confirmed by erjos
    and zoobab)
-   storing place for demo materials
