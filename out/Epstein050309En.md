his points and analyse his claims.*

### Comments

*The numbering follows the comments in the*
[article](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/6634 "wikilink") *I\'m reacting
to.*

**1.** It\'s indeed possible to argue that software patents can also
help !SMEs, but the !SMEs themselves argue against that. See
declarations by [ CEA-PME](Ceapme050201En "wikilink") (represents
500,000 European !SMEs) and
[UEAPME](http://www.ueapme.org/docs/press_releases/pr_2005/050307_Computer_Patent.pdf "wikilink")
(represents 11 million European !SMEs). The problem with the Microsoft
argument is that this disregards

-   the fact that Microsoft has a lot more patents than you, and if you
    ship a product you probably infringe on a lot more patents of theirs
    than the other way round. This strategy only works if you are a
    patent parasite (like e.g. Eolas).
-   If you want to go to court, this costs between [\$500,000 and
    \$4,000,000](http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/conf0411/tue/Brian%20Kahin.pdf "wikilink")
    (see slide 9, presentation by [Brian
    Kahin](http://www.si.umich.edu/~kahin/bio.html "wikilink")). Most
    !SMEs simply cannot afford this (neither offensively nor
    defensively). Those and other costs are why economists often talk
    about the high transaction costs of the patent system.

Software patents generally simply do not help you if Microsoft or
another big player imitates you, on the contrary.

**2.** Regarding the progress bar, they meant that it would not be
excluded anymore by its nature. You seem to be unaware of the fact that
the European Patent Convention [article
52](http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html "wikilink")
states that computer programs, presentation of information, and several
related things are not inventions in the sense of patent law, so long as
the patent relates to those things as such.

There\'s a whole discussion between proponents and opponents of software
patents as to [what that as such
means](http://wiki.ffii.org/TheMeaningOfAsSuchEn "wikilink"), but
suffice to say that even most proponents of software patents in Europe
think the principle behind the progress bar shouldn\'t be patentable.
Nonetheless, the European Patent Office [did grant a patent on
it](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/txt/ep/0394/160/ "wikilink") to IBM at
one time (against the rules of the European Patent Convention), but the
patent has been discontinued by IBM since October 2004 (they didn\'t
continue paying the fees).

**3.** European patent law has a long tradition in only allowing patents
for so-called \"technical inventions\". In absence of a definition in
the law, the meaning of \"technical\" has over the years been
reinterpreted by the European Patent Office (as well as by some national
ones, and also by a number of courts) from something like \"concrete and
physical\" to the stuff that that\'s listed
[here](http://www.iusmentis.com/patents/businessmethods/epc/#TheexclusionofArticle522and3EPC "wikilink")
under the heading *\"When is something technical\"*.

**5.** Patents both encourage and discourage investments. If the chance
that your own product will infringe on a lot of other patents is very
high, the risk of your investment actually increases in a situation
where patents are allowed (even if you have the money to patent the
innovations in your own product).

See for example [this
declaration](http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/patent_declaration.html "wikilink")
by a bunch of venture capital firms. Benchmark Capital is the company
behind the startup capital of e.g. eBay.

**6.** You\'re right broad patents are not limited to software patents.
Nonetheless, software patents do seem to be more susceptible to that
problem, and often result in so-called \"wish patents\", as explained by
[ Reinier Bakels](BakelsMyths0405En "wikilink") (a Dutch lawyer and law
scholar who wrote a report on software patents for the European
Parliament).

**7.** See the remark about the venture capital firms. Also have a look
at [ many economic studies](ConsParl0406En "wikilink") carried out on
that subject. And before you reply that you are certain that at least as
many exist which state the contrary: I\'d love to see them. The only one
I know of is [this
one](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=510103 "wikilink"),
and is [debunked
here](http://k.lenz.name/LB/archives/000831.html "wikilink").

**8.** The main problem is that there is very little data available on
the effects of (software) patents on !SMEs. As long as you remain under
the radar of the big guys and patent parasites, there\'s no problem.
Otherwise, if you get a claim, it\'s often cheaper to get a license for
\$50,000 than a court case for \$500,000. Companies are generally
reluctant to publicise this info however, as those are not events they
want to focus attention on (they had to pay money to be able to continue
what they were doing before).

Therefore there are virtually no statistics about often that happens.
The only statistics we have are about cases which actually went to
court. See the last slide in [this
presentation](http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/conf0411/tue/Jim%20Bessen.pdf "wikilink")
by [Jim Bessen](http://www.researchoninnovation.org "wikilink") for
those. We can only assume that many more cases do not make it to court
than those which do. Consequently, the only real data points you have
here are court cases and what !SMEs themselves say.

**9.** You\'re correct in saying no one performs patent searches when
developing software, which sort of defeats the whole \"disclosure in
return for a monopoly\" principle of the patent system. Large companies
can easily deal when problems pop up later, for small ones it\'s more
difficult. See also point (2) on page 12 of [this
summary](http://www.isi.fhg.de/ti/Soft_summary.pdf "wikilink") of a
study by the Fraunhofer (mp3!) and Max Planck Institutes.

**10.** Both trademarks and trade secrets can be classified under the
generic term \"intellectual property\". The term generally merely refers
to intangible assets. The part that\'s misleading about the grouping is
that apart from being intangible, they have nothing in common and have
quite different effects (demonstrated by the fact that you did/do not
consider trademarks to be among them).

**12.** Your argument is based on the misconception that it is virtually
impossible to accidentally infringe on another company\'s patents. The
[inverse is true](http://www.ovum.co.uk/go/content/c,50373 "wikilink").
Additionally, in some cases you just have no choice, as in the case of
official or de facto standards. They call it the \"networking effects\":
the more interoperable your program is, the more valuable it becomes. An
image processing program which cannot handle JPEG is virtually
worthless, regardless of its merits.

**13.** Patent trolls are unique in the sense that they are unaffected
by patents of the defendant, so that \"defensive patenting\" becomes
useless. These companies generally employ 2 \"scientists\" and 50
lawyers. Every week the scientists hold brainstorm sessions with the
lawyers writing down as many patentable ideas as possible. They don\'t
pump new capital into the tech industry, they extract capital from it,
most of which goes to said lawyers.

You may think this is a perfectly valid business model, but consumers
only profit from an innovation if it\'s actually incorporated in
products. If this kind of business is indeed more advantageous than
developing products (you get the benefits of the patents without the
downsides) and more and more companies switch to that model, we get a
problem.

Add to that developments like [Myhrvold Intellectual
Ventures](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6478691/site/newsweek/ "wikilink"),
whose sole goal is to buy up small patent trolls in order to become the
biggest of them all (supported by a few large companies who get to use
those patents in return), and you get some really scary patent power
concentration.

**14.** I don\'t understand what makes you think that people have
unfettered rights to get monopolies on plain (albeit new) ideas. As you
nicely cited from the US constitution before, the rationale for patents
is not that you have a right to them, but that they should be
advantageous for the economy and society (by promoting \"science and
useful arts\"). If that last condition is not fulfilled, there no reason
for society (congress) to grant those rights.

There is no economic (or other) law which dictates that temporary
monopolies on whatever (useful) product of the mind will on the whole
encourage rather than hamper innovation. As those studies I cited above
show, there are even quite a few indications to the contrary in so far
computer-implemented mathematics, presentation of information etc is
concerned.

**15.** Patents are not about the right to use a particular piece of
software (that\'s regulated by copyright). What you describe means that
you are using the same idea or algorithm. Can a mathematical algorithm
(or an application of it) belong to someone? That depends on whether you
accept software patents or not. And whether or not you accept those,
should not depend on some feeling about a \"natural right\" (it is even
generally acknowledged that there is [no such
right](http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/swpat/conf1404/bakelspres.pdf "wikilink")
in so far patents are concerned, as opposed to in case of copyright and
tangible property), but on whether or not they have an overall good
effect.

**16.** You might be interested in [this
website](http://web.archive.org/web/20030407041027/http%3a//www.youmaybenext.com/ "wikilink").
It was set up by a bunch of companies who were being sued by a patent
holding company called !PanIP (!PanIP never thought they\'d stick
together, so gave up and went looking elsewhere for easier targets),
which does own patents covering selling over the Internet in a certain
sense.

You\'re right they always have to claim some sort of \"implementation\",
but in practice the resulting monopolies are almost always very broad
(as you mentioned yourself before).

Regarding Amazon\'s 1-click patent, you\'re the first person I\'ve seen
that actually tries to defend it. Would Amazon not have developed that
\"invention\" if they knew they wouldn\'t be able to patent it? Would
other people not know about that \"invention\" or how to implemented it
if Amazon hadn\'t published it in a patent? Patents are in practice used
as strategic business tools, but always keep in mind the original goal
of patents.

**17.** There are indeed general quality problems with the patent
system, and those are even coming [ back to
haunt](Martin041109En "wikilink") the Western companies that abuse this
fact and at the same time accuse the Chinese of \"stealing\" everything.

Your argument of throwing away the baby with the bath water can also be
reversed: are all those problems actually worth it? Is the overall
positive effect of software patents greater than what\'s caused by the
practical problems (which may or may not be solvable within reasonable
time) and the nature of software combined?

**18.** The problem is that software patents in first instance decrease
competition, see e.g. the the middle slide on page 4 of [this
presentation](http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/46/12599659.pdf "wikilink")
(by a very pro software patents person from the European Commission).
And the FTC report from 2003 concluded that not patents, but competition
is in fact the main driving force of [innovation in the software
sector](http://www.ffii.org.uk/swpat/ftc/ftc.html#software "wikilink").

**19.** They might want to give that \"away for free\" because there\'s
a much higher chance of losing money in the patent system than gaining
any, especially as a small player. It\'s like playing the lottery for
small entities. For large companies it\'s more like an insurance system
however.

**20.** Patents and copyright are indeed different in nature, but from a
software producing business perspective it doesn\'t matter: in both
cases, they apply (or don\'t) to the product you want to sell. You are
wrong regarding what copyright protects however, it covers a lot more
than literal copying. Phoenix didn\'t use a clean room approach to
[reverse engineer and
re-implement](http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,65532,00.html "wikilink")
the IBM PC bios just for fun.

**22.** Your reply regarding \"it\'s new, so it can\'t be obvious\"
perfectly illustrates why the obviousness test doesn\'t work in
practice. Patent law is indeed only a hair away from allowing trivial
patents, since if it\'s trivially different from whatever has been
published before, you can argue it wasn\'t obvious. Since there is no
way to measure the \"height\" of an invention, this is indeed an
inherent (and long recognised) problem of patent law. [This
discussion](http://swpat.ffii.org/stidi/frili/index.en.html#sys "wikilink")
between a Deputy Director of the UK Patent Office and a programmer can
also be enlightening.

Regarding making the distinction, that\'s an entirely other discussion.
There\'s a very long text about that
[here](http://swpat.ffii.org/stidi/korcu/index.en.html "wikilink"), and
you could also read the German High Patent Court\'s [\"Disposition
program\"](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/bgh-dispo76/index.en.html "wikilink")
judgement from 1976.

In so far getting the implementation right is concerned: I propose they
do that first in the US, check whether software patents then have more
positive than negative effects and if so, we can still introduce them
under those fixed rules in Europe.
