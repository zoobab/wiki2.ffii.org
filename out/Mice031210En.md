` Das Muenster Institute of Computational Economics (MICE) an der`\
` Universität Münster hatte im Auftrag von Microsoft Deutschland`\
` errechnet, dass sich bei den untersuchten Partnerunternehmen 11,2`\
` Milliarden Euro Umsatz auf die Verbindung mit Microsoft zurückführen`\
` lassen. Damit könnten jedem Euro Umsatz von Microsoft selbst rund 7,5`\
` Euro Umsatz bei den Partnern zugerechnet werden. Generell liege der`\
` Umsatz der Microsoft-Partner über dem Durchschnitt auf dem IT-Markt.`

In these treatises you can find unmotivated and unsubstantiated
assertions about the importantce of patents for a \"healthy software
industry\" at serveral locations, e.g. on page 31 of the \"OpenSource\"
treatise.

In general the authors strive to adorn various Microsft PR assertions
with an aura of science without subjecting them to the test of
scientific scrutiny.

This study is reminiscent of a series of current attempts at presenting
\"open source\" as a communist phenomenon and software patents as a
necessary corollary of capitalism, thereby hoping to achieve by means of
ideologisation what can not be achieved by means of more respectable
scholarly methods.

The institute advertises its treatises as a scientific achievement on
its [MICE front page](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/ "wikilink").

It also advertises [proprietary MS-only
software](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/software/index.htm "wikilink")
which it is developping for field of economics in order to \"help make
economic theory more easily accessible to end-users\". Many of the
[articles](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/presentations/index.htm "wikilink")
written by MICE members revolve around this software

The MICE [OpenSource](OpenSource "wikilink") treatise says that
universities should not be encouraged to develop free software and that
such software tends to cater to the taste of developers and to ignore
the needs of end-users. However in science, peer review is important,
and the peers of the MICE developers are other developers, i.e. other
economists. As the [MICE mission
page](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/about/index.htm "wikilink") says about
the near future:

` What we now call computational economics will be an integrated part`\
` of economics.`

Making software proprietary means making economics proprietary, i.e.
removing science from peer review.

Universities in Germany are currently under heavy pressure to finance
themselves. At the same time there is a pressure from the scientific
community to allow peer review, i.e. open source development. Some of
the researchers who are caught in the middle between these two demands
may tend to react nervously or to see monetary reward as the only valid
incentive for science, just as for software.

The main author of the studies, Dr. Stefan Kooths, is listed as head of
the [team](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/team/index.htm "wikilink").

Dr. Kooths, has been parliamentary candidate of the liberal democratic
party (FDP) of North-Rhine-Westfalia, see

`     `[`http://mice.uni-muenster.de/team/kooths/ltw2000/index.htm`](http://mice.uni-muenster.de/team/kooths/ltw2000/index.htm)

and as such advertising an belief system in which everything in society
should be determined by individuals subject to private monetary
incentives, and claiming that this belief system is related to Mr.
Kooth\'s background as a scholar in macro-economics.
