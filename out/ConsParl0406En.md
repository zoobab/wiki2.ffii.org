## Studies about software patents taken into account by the EP in first reading {#studies_about_software_patents_taken_into_account_by_the_ep_in_first_reading}

-   2000: [The Digital Dillemma: Intellectual Property in the
    Information Age (National Research
    Council)](http://books.nap.edu/html/digital_dilemma/ "wikilink")
    (NRC00):
    -   -   Granting of software patents started in the US without
            oversight from the legislative branch (just like in Europe)
        -   Doubts about ability US Patent Office to handle software
            patent related decisions, and whether it has enough
            knowledge and prior art information available
        -   Software market is different from traditional industries:
            small or no market in \"components\", most people write
            programs from scratch, no consultation of patent literature,
            high chances of infringement
        -   Innovation in software development occurs faster than in
            other industries, patents often granted after the technology
            has become obsolete
        -   Software patents may cause the software industry to cease
            being a creative cottage industry, restricting it to large
            companies that cross-license
-   October 2000: [IPI
    Study](http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/indprop/comp/study_en.htm "wikilink")
    (IPI00):
    -   -   \"As shown in our economic study of the literature (Section
            III of our report), most economists have doubts whether
            economic efficiency, i.e. increased overall welfare, is
            achieved by having or making computer program related
            inventions patentable. This caution is supported by the
            continuing, indeed growing, concern in the USA on the issues
            surrounding patents on computer program related inventions.
            The debate in the States is not finished.\"
        -   There is no evidence that the positive effects stemming from
            owning software patents outweigh the following deep
            concerns:

`    * that patents are being granted on trivial, indeed old, ideas and that consideration of such patents let alone attacking such patents is a major burden, particularly on SME and independent software developers;`\
`    * that patents may strengthen the market position of the big players; and`\
`    * that the computer program related industries are examples of industries where incremental innovation occurs and that there are serious concerns whether, in such industries, patents are welfare enhancing.`

-   December 2000: [EU Consultation by
    Commission](http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/softpatanalyse.htm "wikilink")
    ([FFII
    analysis](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eukonsult00/index.en.html "wikilink"))
    (CON00):
    -   -   92% of respondents were against software patents, 44% of
            remaining 8% proponents were \"IPR-specialists\".
        -   What percentage of participants belonging to the following
            groups was against software patents:

`    * Individuals: 98,5%`\
`    * `[`SMEs`](SMEs "wikilink")`: 95%`\
`    * Large Enterprises: 81%`\
`    * Associations: 45%`\
`    * User: 99,6%`\
`    * Student: 99,5%`\
`    * Academic: 98,0%`\
`    * Software Developer: 95,8%`\
`    * IP Professional: 33%`\
`    * Governmental: 22%`

-   May 2001: [Intellectual property rights in a knowledge-based economy
    (The Dutch Advisory Council for Science and Technology
    Policy)](http://www.awt.nl/uploads/files/as21.pdf "wikilink")
    (AWT01)
    -   -   \"Though IPR regulations for software did not exist in the
            1970s, rapid innovation took place nonetheless.\"
        -   \"The legal overlap between software patents and copyrights
            to protect the same product is claimed to be
            over-protective, and likely to result in a monopolistic
            dominance of technological know-how in software
            development.\"
        -   \"Nevertheless, from this debate [software patents in the
            US](about "wikilink") we may conclude that, to some extent,
            drawbacks of current over-protective regimes outweigh the
            advantages arising from implementation of a strengthened
            legislation.\"
        -   \"Software is in many ways a \`general use\' technology.
            \[\...\] Thus, if it were widely diffused, it would have
            very large positive effects on further knowledge creation,
            and would reduce costs of production of many goods in the
            economy.\"
        -   \"That is, the net benefit of the monopoly given to
            innovators while still strong at the individual level, is at
            the social level less so. \[\...\] An over-protective regime
            prevents just the type of entry that causes and is caused by
            rapid advance (Samuelson et. al., op. cit.; Davis et. al.,
            1996)\"
        -   \"These sorts of arguments suggest that if it were possible,
            software should have a less restrictive IPR regime than many
            other goods.\"

    Patentability of Software Innovations (Max Planck Institute and
    Fraunhofer
    Institute)](http://www.isi.fhg.de/ti/Soft_summary.pdf "wikilink")
    ([presentation
    slides](http://trendchart.cordis.lu/Reports/Documents/Edler_Lux_2003.ppt "wikilink"))
    (MPF01):
    -   -   Patents are the least used way and least significant means
            to protect investments in software development
        -   Development time is very short and innovation occurs
            extremely rapidly in the software field compared to other
            fields
        -   More incremental development in software branch than in most
            other industries
        -   Rapid innovation and effective development process even more
            important in software than in other fields, so obstacles to
            conducting development work are even more serious here
        -   Interoperability is extremely important
        -   R&D intensity has no influence on patenting behaviour
        -   Basic rule as in other branches holds: bigger companies
            obtain more patents
        -   \'The theory that patents facilitate market access, above
            all for young companies, could not be confirmed.\'
        -   \'The strategic benefit of patents in international
            competition is obvious, but concentrated on very few large
            companies.\'
        -   \'From the legal part of the study it emerged that the
            present ban on patenting \"software as such\" leads to
            problems. The present statutory exception for \"computer
            programmes as such\" not only does not allow reasonable
            interpretations, but also in practice leads to a tremendous
            amount of arguments which is incomprehensible, not only for
            outsiders.\'

    (BAH02):
    -   -   Commission-ordered study
        -   General problems with patent system as a whole
        -   Software patents have caused a lot of problems in the US
            (both economical and administrative)
        -   Requirement of \"technical contribution\" is too vague in
            Commission proposal and can easily be circumvented, may even
            not be relevant by Commission\'s own admission (in that it
            cannot prevent all business methods from being patented)

    ([FFII
    analysis](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/cec-telecom02/index.en.html "wikilink"))
    (KIO02):
    -   -   Patents cause a lot of problems in the Telecom sector
        -   Patents are mainly used strategically there (block
            competitors, make sure you are not blocked by a competitor),
            not to earn back investments

    (EESC02) on the Commission proposal:
    -   -   Commission text allows patents on software executed by a
            computer
        -   Commission text simply codifies EPO practice
        -   Commission text does not prevent patents on business (or on
            any other) methods
        -   Commission text does not preserve interoperability, confuses
            matters further instead
        -   Doubts about intention of Commission, which talks about
            several irrelevant things (such as piracy) in its
            introduction
        -   No effective economic analysis that shows benefits for !SMEs
        -   \"It is hardly plausible to have us believe that the
            directive would only be a sort of reversible three-year
            experiment, at the end of which an assessment would be
            made\"

            control physical effects beyond the digital representation
            of information\'\" (art 2 EP)

-   April 2003: [An Empirical Look at Software Patents
    (Bessen&Hunt)](http://www.researchoninnovation.org/online.htm#sw "wikilink")
    (BH03):
    -   -   Software patents have in the US resulted in a transfer of
            R&D money to obtaining patents
        -   Most software patents are owned by the traditional industry

`    * This dispels (once more) the myth that they allow the "lone software inventor" to benefit from his innovation.`\
`    * This traditional industry often uses software to control machines, and as such this study shows that software patents are bad there as well`

-   -   Software patents hinder instead of encourage innovation in
        fields where most innovation is incremental, such as in software
        development

    Competition and Patent Law and Policy (Federal Trade Commission,
    US)](http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf "wikilink")
    (FTC03)
    -   -   All industries are not alike: in the computer hardware and
            software patents are used more and more as defensive means.
            This results in \"patent thickets\": overlapping and
            entangled patent rights of several companies, which requires
            a license for all such patents before being able to
            commercialise a product.
        -   The software industry is characterised by cumulative
            innovation, low capital costs, swift consecutive
            innovations, short product life spans and alternative
            encouragements for innovation such as copyright and Open
            Source. This is very different from the hardware, biotech
            and pharmaceutical industries.
        -   Innovation in the software industry is driven by
            competition.
        -   software patents can hinder follow-up innovation and
            increase the startup costs. Avoiding infringement is
            expensive and uncertain.
        -   There is also a big problem with trivial patents.

## To be added {#to_be_added}

-   In fact, read just [one
    paper](http://repositories.cdlib.org/iber/econ/E03-331/ "wikilink"),
    by the economist Bronwyn H. Hall at the University of California at
    Berkeley \'Business Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy\' (where
    she discusses software patents, as no non-trivial business method
    patent has been granted which does not rely upon software). You see
    the conclusion: \"Broad evidence that the patent system encourages
    innovation always and everywhere is hard to come by. When
    innovations are incremental [as with software](such "wikilink") and
    when many different innovations must be combined \[such as with
    software\] to make a useful product, it is less obvious that
    benefits of the patent system outweigh the costs.\"

    pages 81-123:
    -   -   \"Furthermore, patents affect the allocation of R&D
            resources across industries, and patents can distort
            resources away from industries where they are most
            productive.\"

## Introductory Question {#introductory_question}

**Q: What is a software patent?**

**Short A:** Software patents are patents on an immaterial innovations.
This means that the novel part of the \"invention\" is limited to a new
insight in maths, data processing, business methods, etc. These
innovations are normally not patentable, but by stating they are
\"computer-implemented\" (i.e., turned into software) they suddenly do
become patentable by the EPO\'s (and Commission\'s and Council\'s)
standards. Hence the name \"software patents\".

**Long A:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Economical Questions {#economical_questions}

**Q: Why did the EP categorically say no to software patents?**

**Short A:** Patent law is economic law, and virtually all economic
studies show mainly negative effects from software patents. The
Commission did not carry out a thorough impact assessment study. The
majority of European companies is against software patents.

**Long A:** As stated in the introduction of [BAH02](BAH02 "wikilink"),
patent law is economic law. This means that unlike copyright, where
there is a notion of a natural author\'s right to a creation, patents
are only to be granted if its clear they will spur the economy and
innovation. [NRC00](NRC00 "wikilink") and BH03 (and since the EP\'s
decision, also [FTC03](FTC03 "wikilink")) show however that software
patents do not have this effect in the US, where they exist already
since quite some time. [IPI00](IPI00 "wikilink") and
[MPF00](MPF00 "wikilink") could also not find any evidence that software
patents would be generally beneficial to European companies, or indeed
not even that the negative effects of software patents would be
neutralised by the positive ones.

KIO02 indicates that similar patents have very bad effects in the
Telecommunications sector. [CON00](CON00 "wikilink") and
[MPF01](MPF01 "wikilink") show that the majority of European companies
(both large and small), academics and individuals are against extending
the scope of patentability, and that patents are among the least
significant forms of IP-protection. Finally, [EESC02](EESC02 "wikilink")
shows that the Economic and Social Committee notes that not a single
thorough study on the economic effects of software patents has been
undertaken, especially in relation to their effects on
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") (Small and Medium Enterprises). This lack of
knowledge is also heavily criticised in [BAH02](BAH02 "wikilink").

**Q: Don\'t investments in software development have to be protected?**

**Short A:** The major investments in software development are protected
by copyright, and several other protection means (which require this
copyright protection to work) are employed as well. Software patents
undermine the protections offered by copyright.

**Long A:** The ultimate result of the software development process, the
computer program, is already protected by copyright. This protection
covers the work that went into turning a large number of ideas (a few
from yourself, but many from other people as well) into a usable
program: creating a design (blueprint) of the program, writing it and
then testing it and removing all the errors.

Software patents on the other hand cover the underlying principles and
methods of programs (even though patents were originally intended to
allow claims on inventions, not on mere ideas). Because of the
incremental nature of the software field, every program is bound to use
many pre-existing methods and techniques (just like when constructing a
mathematical proof, or when writing a story). Allowing monopolies on
such individual methods therefore blocks a large number of independent
follow-up creations.

This is confirmed by [MPF00](MPF00 "wikilink"), where a majority of all
questioned companies agrees that the introduction of software patents
will diminish competition, reduce the variety of products, and inhibit
innovation. It also notes that companies use many different ways to earn
back software-related investments (in order of importance):
copy-protection measures, customer-relations management, lead-time
advantages, protections against reverse-engineering, trademarks, secrecy
pledges and incentives for employees, know-how contracts and prosecution
of copyrights. Only at the very end, patents are mentioned.

Finally, both [KIO02](KIO02 "wikilink") and BH03 note that
software/telecom patents are mainly used strategically (offensively to
lock out a competitor from a market segment, and defensively to make
sure you cannot be locked out by someone else), and not to earn back
investments.

**Q: What about mobile phones and washing machines?**

**Short A:** The European Parliament\'s version does not exclude
technical inventions which are computer-controlled. Several patents in
the telecom (and electronics) sector are however indeed pure software
patents and would remain unenforceable, but [KIO02](KIO02 "wikilink")
explains those have an overall negative effect as well. Same for BH03.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Juridical Questions {#juridical_questions}

**Q: What is the general idea behind the European Parliament (EP)
amendments?**

**Short A:** Keep software-controlled technical inventions patentable,
but make sure that non-inventions cannot become patentable by stating
they are computer-controlled.

**Long A:** The doctrine followed by the European Parliament boils down
to stating that whether or not an innovation makes use of software, is
completely irrelevant as far as patentability is concerned. If the
described innovation would be patentable if described in plain English
(or another natural language) and when not executed by a computer, would
it be patentable? If yes, then your invention is perfectly patentable,
also if you say it\'s entirely realised using a computer program.

If no: sorry, but simply translating the instructions to realise your
innovation into a computer program does not suddenly turn it into a
patentable invention (the work you did while doing that is protected by
copyright, and the rest is either a patentable invention or not,
regardless of its form).

**Q: Doesn\'t the EP-version contradict international treaties such as
TRIPS?**

**Short A:** No, [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") only requires patents to be
available for inventions. Software (executed by a computer or not) is
not an invention in Europe. Further, [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") and WIPO
even explicitly forbid software patents.

**Q: Isn\'t the Commission/Council text merely confirming the status
quo?**

**Short A:** As [EESC02](EESC02 "wikilink") notes, they simply codify
the practice of the European Patent Office (EPO). The EPO has already
granted more than 30,000 software and business method patents.

**Q: Why did the EP insist on referring to \"forces of nature\"?**

**Short A:** Patent law must be limited to fields where it has possibly
a positive overall effect. The forces of nature doctrine is what
distinguished our European Patent law from the US, and the cause for its
high international regard. It was abolished when it turned out it was
incompatible with software patents.

**Q: Why is \"data processing\" excluded from patentability and what
does this mean?**

**Short A:** All a computer can do, is process data. When it is used to
control an invention, the computer still merely processes data, but the
invention may be or do something patentable. This article ensures
compatibility with [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") and clarifies that software
is not patentable.

**Q: Why was the EP not content with the Commission\'s safeguards for
interoperability?**

**Short A:** The Commission only guarantees the right to
reverse-engineer, which cannot be forbidden by a patent in the first
place. Its article however does not allow the use of the discovered
information. Anti-trust law is too blunt a tool to solve this problem.
