\"Google is the new Gutenberg!\", therefore there is demand to have
patent documents accessible via Google.

Patents documents at Espacenet (official EPO patent database) are
distributed in large pdf files. Large-image !PDFs are useless for
presentation and searching, because they take long time to load, and
they need to be OCR\'ed before the text can be analysed, and FFII doubts
that OCR\'ing is a very precise operation. Better to the text directly
from v3.espacenet.com in ascii. FFII president [ Hartmut
Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink") said he thinks EPO\'s pdf pratice is
because of deals with proprietary patent information services, so there
is no incentive for the EPO to provide a usable system. Patent writings
are \"public domain\".

FFII provides a own text patent database named
[\"Gauss\"](http://gauss.ffii.org "wikilink"). This database serves to
make patents more accessable to public understanding. We use open
databases, statistics and screening. The reason is that EPO currently
does not distiguish business or logical methods from real world
inventions. In reality, the real world values of EPO change from case to
case, and in our experience are leading to broad patents. This will
cause trouble for anyone beeing inventive, rather than the oposite. So
we nead a broader approach than keywords to understand the effects.

What is relevant is that the public can access examples of software
patents, and can monitor the progress of these through the patent
system. (who gets them, which contries dominate, how long from
publication to grant etc.) Not that the documents we display are
entirely exact.

Gauss features Wiki style voting, community system

`   * Statistics about broader patents`\
`   * Search tools that work (e.g. Google) (and internal)`\
`   * Getting the information public`\
`   * Classifications using statistical filters`\
`   * Indicies (wiki)`\
`   * Patent-rankings (best/worst)`
