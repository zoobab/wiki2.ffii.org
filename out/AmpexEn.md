------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ampex was very successful as a producer of large analog tape devices in
the 70-80s but nowadays no longer has successful products on they market
and, like some other companies in that situation, turned to its
portfolio of thousands of patents in the audio data processing area. In
doing so, Ampex was highly successful, similar to Kodak. Ampex seems to
have become a patent venture like Acacia. A small team of patent
portfolio managers and lawyers is raking in the money for the creditors
and thousands of former employees.
