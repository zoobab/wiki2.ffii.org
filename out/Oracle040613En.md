[US Patent
6745238](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,745,238.WKU.&OS=PN/6,745,238&RS=PN/6,745,238 "wikilink")
basically describes a system for database run dynamic websites in which
content creators/providers update the site directly using a simple web
browser instead of going trough the administrator (webmaster). When this
patent was filed in March 31, 2000 there where already free PHP/MySQL
scripts providing the described functionality. Today there must be
thousands of websites using similar systems.

### Abstract

A web site creation and maintenance system permits distributed control
and centralized management of a web site. The physical implementation of
the web site resides on a database maintained by a database
administrator. The web site system permits a site administrator to
construct the overall structure, design and style of the web site. This
allows for a comprehensive design as well as a common look and feel for
the web site. The web site system permits content for the web site to
originate from multiple content contributors. The publication of content
is controlled by content owners. This permits assignment of content
control to those persons familiar with the content. The web site system
is also a self service web site system for content contributors, content
owners, and site administrators. The self service system displays to
users one or more panels that contain input fields to permit the users
to submit content and web site components for publication on the web
site. The user, through use of only a web browser running on the user
computer, transmits the parameter to the web site database. In response,
the web site is updated at the database in accordance with the
parameter.

### Claim 1 {#claim_1}

A method for displaying content, comprising:

-   receiving input that defines a set of perspectives, wherein each
    perspective in the set of perspectives is a cross category grouping
    of one or more content items, and wherein said one or more content
    items is in a plurality of content items;
-   storing, in a database, the plurality of content items, wherein each
    of the plurality of content items belongs to one or more categories;
-   receiving user input that associates subsets of said set of
    perspectives with each of said plurality of content items; and
-   in response to a request to display a web page that contains one of
    said plurality of content items, displaying on said web page a
    selectable control for each perspective in the subset of said set of
    perspectives that is associated with said one of said plurality of
    content items.
