# 31 Companies sued for use of JPEG, shareware companies attacked {#companies_sued_for_use_of_jpeg_shareware_companies_attacked}

Forgent Inc is suing 31 companies for use of the JPEG format and claims
to have obtained license payments from numerous others. The claims are
based on a patent which has also been (illegally) granted by the
European Patent Office and which would become enforcable if the EU
Commission and Council Working Party have [their
way](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/ "wikilink")
(but not if the [Parliament\'s version of the
directive](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/ "wikilink") is
accepted).

Forgent\'s law office Gilchrist & Jenkins has written to Europe
Shareware asking them to buy a license.
