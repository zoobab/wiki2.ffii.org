*Munich, 30 March 2005 \-- In advance of the European Parliament\'s
second reading on a software patent directive, the resistance movement
against software patents in the EU regroups. Today it was announced that
the FFII (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure), the leading
organization that opposes software patents in Europe, will take over the
Nosoftwarepatents.com campaign.*

Through content in 17 languages, !NoSoftwarePatents.com addresses a
pan-European audience and delivers easy-to-understand information on the
controversial topic. The campaign was brought to life last year by
software industry veteran Florian Mueller with the help of three
sponsors \-- 1&1 (a German company that is the world\'s largest Web
host), Red Hat, and !MySQL AB. !NoSoftwarePatents.com quickly became
known for not mincing words in its criticism of companies and
organizations that lobby for software patents.

\"!NoSoftwarePatents.com is by far the best introductory Web site on the
subject of computing idea monopolies to date\", said Hartmut Pilch,
president of the FFII. \"Florian Mueller has contributed an important
missing link between various communities. Together with 1&1, Red Hat and
!MySQL, our media team will now leverage the !NoSoftwarePatents.com
platform to further boost the morale of the large majority of companies
and individuals whose freedom and productivity is currently under
threat.\"

The !NoSoftwarePatents sponsors approved the transfer of the
!NoSoftwarePatents.com site to the FFII, and will work with the FFII in
a similar way as they previously did with !NoSoftwarePatents.com while
it was an independent campaign. \"!MySQL AB believes in copyright law as
the proper mechanism for protecting the rights of software authors, and
we consider software patents harmful to the industry at large\", said
Marten Mickos, CEO of Swedish database company !MySQL AB. \"Together
with 1&1 and Red Hat, we funded the creation of the
!NoSoftwarePatents.com platform, and prior to that we had already been
supporting Florian\'s political work for several months.
!NoSoftwarePatents.com has had an enormous impact, and we are excited to
be working closely with the FFII.\"

Florian Mueller, the founder of !NoSoftwarePatents.com, believes that
the take-over of !NoSoftwarePatents.com \"will further cement the
FFII\'s leadership role\". He pointed out that his biography on the
campaign site had been stating all along that he \"temporarily
interrupted his own software development project\" in order to campaign
against software patents. According to Mr. Mueller, the time had come
for him \"after a fantastic year in politics\" to resume his own project
(a computer game), but he said he will still be involved in the fight
against software patents from time to time.

Current Status of the EU Software Patent Directive

On 7 March, the EU Council, commonly referred to as the \"Council of
Ministers\" because it is comprised of ministers from the member
countries of the union, adopted its \"common position\" on software
patents. The decision was taken against strong resistance by various
national parliaments and despite a request by the European Parliament to
restart the entire process on the controversial directive. A long list
of countries, among them six that had originally supported the proposal,
added unilateral declarations by which they basically distanced
themselves from the decision and suggested substantial amendments in the
further process.

The Council\'s proposal is now on its way to the European Parliament,
which is widely expected to begin a second reading in mid April and to
vote on possible amendments, or rejection, in early July. In order to
take any such decision, the EP now needs a majority of its component
members, which represents a minimum number of 367 votes irrespective of
absences and abstentions. If the EP amends the proposal, then it goes
back to the EU Council and then on to a possible conciliation
proceeding, which in turn might be followed by parallel third readings
in both institutions.
