This is an attempt to break \"FFII computing sucks\" into well-described
and tacklable tasks. A task can be shared by several people. For general
discussion of FFII computing issues, join
[polis-parl](http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/polis-parl "wikilink").
There are also [more specialized](http://lists.ffii.org/ "wikilink")
