# C4C rent a yacht to promote software patents {#c4c_rent_a_yacht_to_promote_software_patents}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The day before the vote on the software patents directive, Simon Gentry
from Campaign for Creativity has rent a boat with a banner asking to
vote for the software patents directive. At the same time, people who
were demonstrating in their trademark yellow \"Power to the Parliament\"
t-shirts in front of the European Parliament hired some kayaks to
counter the pro-software patents propaganda.*
