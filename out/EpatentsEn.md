# ePatents

[ software idea patents]([SwideapatEn "wikilink")\]

Terminology used by [Eurolinux
Alliance](http://www.eurolinux.org "wikilink") in their slogan as a
replacement term for software patents.

\"No ePatents\"

The term tried to ride on the popular New Economy-Terminology
(eCommerce, eBusiness, eMedia) where \"e\" stands for \"Electronic\". It
was very popular and common back in the late 90th.

## Problem

-   People often don\'t get the message as they don\'t understand the
    small e. They read \"No patents\".

-   People don\'t get what ePatents are. Literally \"Electronic
    patents\" does not always remind you of Software Patents but of
    patents for electronic devices at large.
