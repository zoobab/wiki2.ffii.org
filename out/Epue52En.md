*The limits of what is patentable which were laid down in the European
Patent Convention of 1973 have been eroded over the years. Influential
patent courts have interpreted Article 52 in a way that renders it
obscure and meaningless. Not all courts have followed this
interpretation, and numerous law scholars have shown why it is not
permissible. The EPO had accepted the inconsistencies in anticipation of
an expected change of law. However this expectation was frustrated in
2000 by the governments and in 2003 by the European Parliament. Thus the
often hidden struggle about interpretation of Art 52 EPC rages on, and
we try to make it visible.*
