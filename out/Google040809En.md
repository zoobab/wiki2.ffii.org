## Synopsis

According to news reports, the internet search engine Google may have to
pay up to 290 millon dollar to Yahoo for a patent on keyword-based
advertisement.

An equivalent has been granted as a design patent by the German Patent
Office, against the letter and spirit of the written law (but as with
patents, the interpretation of the law is stretched like the german
Ministry of justice [ wants to do with the European Law by means of a
directive](Cons040518En "wikilink")).
