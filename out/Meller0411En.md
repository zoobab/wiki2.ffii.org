------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two largely identical articles by Paul Meller, Brussels correspondent
for IDG, report that the EU Council has once more postponed the adoption
of its software patent agreement of May 18th as a \"Common Position\"
and connects this to the Polish government\'s refusal to support this
agreement.

## The Articles {#the_articles}

-   2004-11-23 EU [International Herald Tribune: EU software patent vote
    delayed for more
    debate](http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/22/business/patent.html "wikilink")
-   2004-11-23 US [New York Times: Europe Delays Vote to Unify Patent
    Rule](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&q=%22Europe+Delays+Vote+to+Unify+Patent+Rules%22+%22new+york+times%22&btnG=Search+News "wikilink")

## Observations

-   Meller quotes a Polish Coreper diplomat who seems to be unhappy
    about his government\'s position and eager to weaken this position.
-   Meller\'s news about the alleged postponement may be unrelated to
    the Polish initiative. A postponement of the adoption had already
    been announced a fortnight ago.
-   Meller refers to FFII as a group of open-source advocates. FFII has
    very little to do with advocacy of opensource/free software vs
    proprietary software and indeed is defending all copyright-based
    software business models.
