*Dr. Thomas Wünsche, CEO of a company with 20 employees in the field of
automotive control systems, has raised the contribution of his company
to Economic-Majority.com from EUR 500 to 2500, commenting that this
still is a negligible amount compared to the costs of a failure to
provide adequate support to friendly members of the European Parliament
in the second reading.*
