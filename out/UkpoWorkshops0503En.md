------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The UK Patent Office has, at the order of minister Lord Sainsbury,
conducted a series of workshops with the aim of finding a tighter
definition of \"technical contribution\" that would draw the line where
Sainsbury said it should be drawn, assuming that this problem is solely
to be solved by a definition. Even though FFII UK proposed a definition
that matched Sainsbury\'s stated aims, the UKPO officials proved
unwilling to accept anything that would change their practise of
granting patents on web browsing and office communication software
algorithms.*

## FFII PR about the event {#ffii_pr_about_the_event}

*London, 4 February 2005 \-- The Patent Office has today*
[announced](http://www.patent.gov.uk/media/pressrelease/2005/0402.htm "wikilink")
a [series of
workshops](http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/ippd/issues/cii-workshops.htm "wikilink")
*to examine the possibility of a more concrete definition of \"technical
contribution\" in the Software Patent directive (NB: Registration
deadline 18 February)*

FFII warmly welcomes this development as a very positive and
constructive move by the Minister and the Patent Office.

The whole point of the Directive is that it should clearly define what
is and what is not a \"technical contribution\" and therefore
patentable. Our biggest concern with the logjammed Council of Ministers
text has been that it just defines \"technical contribution\" as a
contribution which is technical\... which could be bent to mean anything
at all. So it is very encouraging that the Minister does seem prepared
to have a serious look at this, and that there is flexibility in the UK
position, to try to get the wording right.

FFII has been asked to submit such a definition to be examined, along
with others, firstly for clarity/definitiveness, and secondly in
relation to the current economic status quo. Our exact wording is still
being reviewed, but it is likely that FFII will offer a text close to
the following. We look forward to hearing the discussion it gets from
workshop-goers:

1.  1.  NB: This has gone out as a press release, so please do not edit
        these paragraphs without clearing with me (jheald) first, even
        if you think there is a problem.

`  "Technical contribution" means a contribution made by a claimed`\
`  invention, considered as a whole, to the state of the art in a`\
`  field of technology.  "Technical" means belonging to a field of `\
`  technology.  `

`  New teaching about the use of controllable forces of nature `\
`  under the control of a computer program, beyond the implementation`\
`  of the data processing procedure itself, is technical.   `\
\
`  The processing, handling, and presentation of information by a `\
`  computer program is not technical, even where technical devices`\
`  are employed for such purposes.`

We believe that this gets very close to satisfying Lord Sainsbury\'s
wishlist from the meeting at the DTI in December, to establish a
distinction between

`  "patentable:  traffic control; medical imaging; washing machines; `\
`  bread makers; robot arms; mobile phones; and vehicle software.`

`  not patentable: accounting packages; spread sheets; translation software;`\
`  computer aided design; internet trading; portfolio management;`\
`  online auctions,"`

\-- so long as the patent claim in the first group does result in a
genuinely different physical process achieved through the computer
control.

(Note that for the claimed invention to be patentable, the technical
contribution would also have to be new and non-obvious \-- ie it must
make an inventive step).

However, the point of the workshops is to examine the pros and cons of
lots of different possible wordings \-- it\'s not a vote \-- so if you
think that there is a clearer way to draw the line, then make the most
of the Patent Office\'s invitation, and submit it.
