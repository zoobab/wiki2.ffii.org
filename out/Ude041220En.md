The mayor of the city of Munich, Christian Ude says in a press statement
that he has called on the federal minister of agriculture, Renate
Künast, to have the software patents directive taken off the agenda in
tomorrow\'s meeting of the EU Agriculture & Fishery Council. Ude says he
\"can see no justification for this hasted proceding of the EU Council\"
and expected that this controversial proposal be rediscussed and
revoted.

EU Software Patent Directive: Agreement in Danger?

*2004-12-20*

The Council of Ministers of the EU will presumably decide on the
controversially-discussed Common Position of the Directive \"On the
Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions\" in the Agriculture
and Fishery Council without further discussion.

In connection with the Linux Projectof Munich City \"!LiMux\" there had
been insecurities about the possible patent-law-related implications of
the planned use of Linux on the city\'s office computers. In november
the Federal Parliament (Bundestag) had taken up Munich\'s demand for
clarity and legal security in an inter-group motion, expressed concerns
about the Council\'s draft and asked for amendments.

Although meanwhile a new discussion about the directive in the EU
Council had been taken into consideration, now the Dutch Council
Presidency is pressing for a decision before Christmas.

This unnecessary hardening of the Council Presidency\'s methods has
provoked a broad opposition which has been calling on the German
representative in the agriculture and fishery council, federal minister
Renate Künast, to demand that either there is a new vote with
discussion, or the item is transferred into the next yeat.

Mayor Christian Ude says: \"I can see no justification for this hasted
proceding of the EU Council. After the multitude of concerns raised by
all sides of politics, of small and medium enterprises and of many
developpers of free software, a further discussion about the directive
proposal and not a nodding-off in the non-expert Council of Agriculture
and Fisheries had been expected. I have today approached minister Künast
to inform her of these expectations.
