------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Hague, 3 July 2006. Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament
(Staten-Generaal) unanimously concluded that the European Commission has
no competence to propose a directive to criminalise intellectual
property infringements. According to the Parliament, the Commission
interprets a recent European Court of Justice decision (C-176/03) too
broadly.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The possibility for the European Commission to make directives
containing criminal measures together with the European Parliament was
opened by the recent European Court of Justice decision. With this
possibility the member states lose their veto.

FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: \"The European Commission and the member
states are now in the process of delineating competence: How far can the
Commission go? In this power struggle the Dutch Parliament made its
statement: the Commission went much too far. Earlier Dutch minister of
Justice Donner already stated he was not \'pleased\' .\"

The Commission can only make directives with criminal measures if these
measures are essential for an essential objective of the Community. The
objective in this case is the realisation of the single market, this
presupposes that without the directive a distortion in trade between
member states would occur. According the Dutch Parliament this is not
the case, no more means are needed, but prioritizing and exchange of
information may be more important. The Parliament also observes that the
Commission does not state that criminals would go to the member state
having the lowest penalties, thus all factual foundation is missing. The
criminals would soon become punishable in the member state having the
higher penalty anyway. Additionally the Parliament mentions a directive
on civil enforcement of \"intellectual property rights\" currently being
implemented by the member states. The high damages may be seen as
sanctions.

The proposed directive would make all intentional commercial scale
infringements of \"intellectual property rights\", including patents, a
criminal offence. Since it is well known that it is impossible to write
software without infringing any software patents, the directive will
criminalise the entire software sector.

Professional software users may violate patents even if they own a valid
copyright license. Since professional use of software is intentional and
on a commercial scale, such used will also be covered by the
directive\'s terms.

FFII analyst Ante Wessels says: \"The stated aim of the directive is to
combat piracy and organised crime, but the directive goes much further.
Companies which are not pirates are criminalised too. We can only hope
that the Dutch Parliament\'s strong condemnation will wake up people and
parliaments all over Europe.\"

`Both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) conclude that no competence`\
`has been granted to the Community for the intended action's desired aim. Both Chambers`\
`have nonetheless - unnecessarily - submitted the directive in question to the`\
`principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and concluded that the proposal fails to`\
`meet these tests."`

-   Original Dutch conclusion (nr [KST98457](KST98457 "wikilink")):

` Beide Kamers der Staten-Generaal concluderen dat voor de na te streven doelstelling`\
` van het voorgenomen optreden geen bevoegdheid aan de Gemeenschap is toegekend.`\
` Niettemin hebben beide Kamers onderhavig voorstel  ten overvloede  onderworpen`\
` aan de beginselen van subsidiariteit en proportionaliteit en geconcludeerd dat het`\
` voorstel daaraan niet voldoet."`
