## Title

\|\| number \|\| submitter \|\| recommendation \|\| text \|\| \|\| 1
\|\| Rocard \|\| + \|\| DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
COUNCIL on the patentability of computer-controlled inventions \|\| \|\|
42 = 43 \|\| Kudrycka and Zwiefka; Bertinotti \|\| ++ \|\| Proposal for
a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
patentability of computer-aided inventions \|\| \|\| 44 \|\| Murko,
Manders, Wallis \|\| o \|\| Directive 2004/../EC of the European
Parliament of the Council on the patentability of computer operated
inventions \|\|

All amendments try to get rid of the misleading term
\"computer-implemented invention\", which is very good. The offered
alternatives are \"computer-controlled invention\", \"computer-aided
invention\" and \"computer-operated invention\". Additionally, amendment
42/43 includes a clause in the justification to perform this
substitution everywhere in the text. We prefer the term \"computer-aided
invention\" because of the common use of the term \"CAD/CAM\" ([
\"computer-aided design/computer-aided
manufacturing\"](JuriObjektCADCAM0505En "wikilink")), but the other
alternatives are more or less good as well, except that
\"computer-operated\" is still too close to \"computer-implemented\" to
be worth the effort of changing.

## Article 1 {#article_1}

\| number \| submitter \| recommendation \| text \| \| 23 \| Rocard \| +
\| This Directive lays down rules for the patentability of
computer-controlled inventions, sometimes also known as
computer-implemented inventions. \| \| 45 \| Ortega \| ++ \| This
Directive lays down rules on the limits of patentability and on the
enforceability of computer program patents. \| \| 46 = 47 \|Kudrycka and
Zwiefka; Bertinotti \| ++ \| This directive lays down limiting rules for
the patentability of computer-aided inventions. \| \| 48 \|
Lichtenberger, Frassoni \| + \| This Directive lays down rules
concerning the patentability of computer-assisted inventions. \|

These amendments remove more occurrences of the term
\"computer-implemented invention\", and some (45/46=47) also explicitly
note the goal is to limit rather than to affirm patentability.
