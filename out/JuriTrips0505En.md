\|\| Rocard \|\| + \|\| The Community and its Member States are bound by
the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights
(TRIPS), approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994
concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as
regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the
Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994). Article 27(1) of
TRIPS provides that patents shall be available for any inventions,
whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided
that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of
industrial application. Moreover, according to that Article, patent
rights should be available and patent rights enjoyable without
discrimination as to the field of technology. These principles should
accordingly apply to computer-controlled inventions, without prejudice
however to the legitimate interests of software authors as regards
exploitation of their work, as stipulated by Article 13 of TRIPS, since
computer programs are protected under copyright pursuant to Article 10
of this agreement. \|\| \|\| 185 \|\| Kauppi \|\| + \|\| The Community
and its Member States are bound by the Agreement on trade-related
aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), approved by Council
Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on
behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its
competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral
negotiations (1986-1994). \|\| \|\| 186 = 187 = 188 \|\| Kudrycka and
Zwiefka; Bertinotti; Ortega \|\| ++ \|\| The Community and its Member
States are bound by the Agreement on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property rights (TRIPS), approved by Council Decision
94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the
European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the
agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations
(1986-1994) 1. Article 27(1) of TRIPS provides that patents shall be
available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all
fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive
step and are capable of industrial application. Moreover, according to
that Article, patent rights should be available and patent rights
enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology. This
means that patentability must be effectively limited in terms of general
concepts such as \"invention\", \"technology\" and \"industry\", so as
to avoid both unsystematic exceptions and uncontrollable extensions,
both of which would act as barriers to free trade. Thus inventions in
all fields of applied natural science are patentable, whereas
innovations in fields such as mathematics, data processing and
organisational logic, are not patentable, regardless of whether a
computer is used for their implementation or not. \|\| \|\| 189 \|\|
Lichtenberger, Frassoni \|\| + \|\| The Community and its Member States
are bound by the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual
property rights (TRIPS), approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22
December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European
Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements
reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994).
Article 27(1) of TRIPS provides that patents shall be available for any
inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology,
provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of
industrial application. Moreover, according to that Article, patent
rights should be available and patent rights enjoyable without
discrimination as to the field of technology. These principles should
accordingly apply to computer-assisted inventions. Nevertheless, the
field of software is not considered to be a field of technology. \|\|

All amendments remove the Council\'s incorrect claim that !TRIPs
mandates software patents. Some, like 4, 186=187=188, 189 add some extra
provisions to clarify that forbidding software patents can be easily
made !TRIPs-compliant by noting that pure software innovations do not
belong to a field of technology.
