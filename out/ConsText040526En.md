The Council of Ministers has published the [latest version of its
directive
text](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st09/st09713.en04.pdf "wikilink")
(changes are underlined).

This was [ secured by a slim qualified majority by a deceptive maneuver
of the german delegation at the ministers\'
meeting](Cons040518En "wikilink") and still [ needs to be confirmed by
the national governments](ConsReversEn "wikilink").

Previous versions of the text were not published, and even for
disclosing old text versions with positions of national governments
deleted, formal approval procedures were needed.
