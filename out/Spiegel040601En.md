------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spiegel.de, the website of Germany\'s most influential newsweekly,
published an article on justice minister Brigitte Zypries\'
\"self-defense\" in a [ chat](HeiseZypries040528De "wikilink").

The initial version of the article stated that those who wish to support
anti-swpat positions need to vote for [ FDP](SwpatfdpDe "wikilink")
(liberal democrats) or [ PDS](SwpatpdsDe "wikilink") (post-communists).
The article said that while the [ Greens](SwpatgrueneDe "wikilink") had
long been anti-swpat at the EU level, they ultimately supported the [
\"compromise\" of the EU Council](Cons040518En "wikilink").

Later this part of the article was corrected and a [ statement of the
Greens](Gruene040601De "wikilink") was reported in which they express
disagreement with the government\'s position.

FFII was given much support and understanding by the Eurogreens in
Brussels. Laurence Vandewalle is a commited participant.

In the EU elections not the German parliament will be elected but an
European Parliament. The FDP candidates to the European Parliament did
not say whether they support the anti-council vote of the Bundestag-FDP
and the position of most British libdems.
