Council and Commitee translations are done by the [Directorate General
for Interpretation ](http://europa.eu.int/comm/scic "wikilink") of the
European Commission, as reorganized in October 2003, with a staff of
almost 900 (plus a huge amount of freelancers). The acronym SCIC is
based on the french term for \'Joint Interpreting and Conference
Service\' which is maintained for historical reasons.

The [European Court of
Justice](http://www.curia.eu.int/en/instit/services/interpretation/interpretation.htm "wikilink")
and the [European
Parliament](http://www.europarl.eu.int/interp/public/default_en.htm "wikilink")
have separate interpreting services.

There are seperate rules for some working aspects internal to the
Commission.

## I. Where and how are the official languages decided ? {#i._where_and_how_are_the_official_languages_decided}

##  {#section_1}

*Language as part of a people\'s identity and their linguistic diversity
must, therefore, be respected; a basic principle in the Treaty that is
regularly recalled by the Council of the Union. Today, Article 314 of
the EC Treaty lays down the principle of multilingualism. Article 21
states that every citizen of the Union may write to any of the
institutions or bodies in one of the languages mentioned in Article 314
and have an answer in the same language. Under the Treaty, the Council
is required to take decisions on the rules governing the languages of
the Community institutions. In fact, Article 1 of the very first
regulation (which has been amended after each successive enlargement)
decided by the Council of Ministers in 1958 listed the official
languages of the Union:*

\"The official languages and the working languages of the institutions
of the Union shall be Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German,
Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.\"

*The regulation is amended again with the enlargement in 2004, adding
Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovenian, Czech,
Hungarian and Estonian.*

1.  1.  So it\'s 20 official languages now, see quotataions of (1)
        below.

*Internally, when European Commission staff hold meetings, no
interpretation is provided: Officials are expected to be able to do
without. The weekly meeting of the College of Commissioners has
interpretation between English, French and German.*

*The new member states and their official EU languages:*

Czech Republic: czech

Republic of Estonia: estonian

Republic of Cyprus: greek

Republic of Latvia: latvian

Republic of Lithuania: lithuanian

Republic of Hungary: hungarian

Republic of Malta: maltese

Republic of Poland: polish

Republic of Sovenia: slovenian

Slovak Republic: slovak

*The old member states and their official EU languages:*

Kingdom of Belgium: french

Kingdom of Denmark: danish

Federal Republic of Germany: german

Hellenic Republic: greek

Kingdom of Spain: spanish

French Republic: french

Ireland: english

Italian Republic: italian

Grand Duchy of Luxembourg: french

Kingdom of the Netherlands: dutch

Republic of Austria: german

Portuguese Republic: portoguese

Republic of Finland: finnish

\(a\) Basic texts

Article 290 of the TEC instructs the Council to determine unanimously
the rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community
\`without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Rules of
Procedure of the Court of Justice\'. It was therefore on that basis that
on 15 April 1958 the Council adopted Regulation No 1 determining the
languages to be used by the European Economic Community (1), as amended
by the various acts of accession. That regulation provides for 11
official languages (Ireland waived the right for Irish to become an
official language of the institutions of the Community) (2). The main
provisions of that regulation are as follows.

-   The official languages and the working languages of the institutions
    of the Community shall be Spanish, Danish, German, Greek, English,
    French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish.\' (Article
    1).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Documents which a Member State or a person subject to the
    jurisdiction of a Member State sends to the institutions may be in
    one of the official languages selected by the sender, the reply
    being drafted in the same language, whereas documents which an
    institution sends to a Member State or to a person subject to its
    jurisdiction are drafted in the language of that State (Articles 2
    and 3). Only the text in the languages used in that correspondence
    is authentic.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted
    in the 11 official languages and the Official Journal is published
    in those languages (Articles 4 and 5). All the linguistic versions
    are authentic.

\(b\) Arrangements for internal implementation (Article 14 of the CRP)

Under Article 6 of the abovementioned Council Regulation No 1, the
institutions may stipulate in their rules of procedure which of the
languages are to be used in specific cases, which the Council did in
Article 14 of the CRP.

\(i\) The principle

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 14 of the CRP, except as otherwise
decided unanimously, \`the Council shall deliberate and take decisions
only on the basis of documents and drafts drawn up in the languages
specified in the rules in governing languages\' (i.e. the above
Regulation No 1) (1).

`<footnote>`{=html}

\(1\) Note that under the procedure provided for in Article 14(1) of the
CRP (unanimous decision concerning deliberations and decisions on the
basis of documents and drafts not drawn up in all the languages) when,
under the Treaties, members of the Council or of Coreper may not
participate in the vote, account is not to be taken of votes by such
members (Annex I(1)(h) to the CRP).

`</footnote>`{=html}

**The term \`drafts\' refers, in particular, to Commission proposals
that must be submitted to the Council in the 11 official languages. This
provision allows a delegation to oppose discussion of an item if, when
the Council brings up the item, the relevant documentation is not
available in the official language it prefers. Paragraph 2 of Article 14
of the CRP also enables each member of the Council to oppose discussion
if the texts of any proposed amendments are not drawn up in such of the
languages referred to in paragraph 1 as he or she may specify (2).**

`<footnote>`{=html}

**(2) A member of the Council or of Coreper may not make use of this
provision in connection with ecisions on which, under the Treaties, that
member may not participate in the vote (Annex I(2)(d) to the CRP.**

`</footnote>`{=html}

**If a document is not yet available in all 11 official languages, it
can nevertheless be the subject of a \`political agreement\' on the
substance. However, subject to the possible derogations set out below,
that text may be adopted only if it is available in good and due form
(i.e. finalised by the legal/linguistic experts) in the 11 official
languages.**

It is to be noted that:

-   a regulation or a directive addressed to all Member States or a
    decision addressed to all Member States cannot enter into force
    (nor, therefore, be published nor the Member States be notified of
    it) unless the text exists in the 11 official languages (Article 4
    of Regulation No 1);

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   a common position of the Council adopted pursuant to the procedures
    referred to in Articles 251 and 252 of the TEC is not forwarded to
    the European Parliament unless it is available in all 11 official
    languages.

\(ii\) Waivers

Article 14(1) of the CRP, in fact, allows for the possibility of waiving
that rule, provided that the Council both decides unanimously and that
it is a matter of urgency. That waiver is mainly used in the first few
months following the accession of new Member States to the European
Union as revised translations in their languages may not be available
within the period laid down. As stated above, the normal languages\'
rules apply in the fields under Title V of the TEU (CFSP). This was
emphasised in a statement annexed to the TEU (1). In the CFSP field,
however, Council acts may be adopted by a simplified written procedure
(known as COREU, Article 12(4) of the CRP) (2) particularly adapted to
urgent situations justifying recourse to the derogation provided for in
Article 14(1) of the CRP. Consequently, while the normal language rules
apply to the adoption of any act in the CFSP field, in particular those
having a legal scope (joint action or common position), the Council may
nonetheless decide, on a case-by-case basis, on grounds of urgency, to
act in the absence of texts in all the official languages, when it does
not intend to publish the text of its decision in the Official Journal
of the European Communities. It is desirable that this particular urgent
situation be briefly mentioned in a recital of the act justifying, in
the particular case, the waiving of the ordinary language rules.

In practice, whenever the Council has recourse to the waiver provided
for in Article 14 of the CRP, it is necessary to:

-   indicate it in the documents submitted to it (report to the Council,
    \`I/A\' item notes);

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   record in the Council minutes the decision to have recourse to the
    waiver;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   likewise note any decision to postpone publication or notification
    of the act pending availability of the text in the 11 official
    languages;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   provide, where appropriate, for subsequent adoption of the missing
    language versions by the Council.

It is to be noted that:

-   the addressee(s) of a directive or an individual decision may be
    notified of it in the language(s) of the Member State concerned
    without waiting for the text to be available in the 11 official
    languages (Article 3 of Regulation No 1);

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   a decision sui generis having no effect vis-à-vis third parties may
    enter into force without the text being available in the 11 official
    languages.

### 1. How it works {#how_it_works}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpreters talk about active and passive languages.

-   An active language is a language the interpreters speak that
    delegates can listen to.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A passive language is a language the interpreters understand that is
    spoken by the delegates.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Symmetric regime means that delegates can speak and listen to
    intepretation from the same languages.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A meeting with an 11-11 language regime has 11 passive and 11 active
    languages. In the European Union institutions this means that all
    the official languages are interpreted into all the official
    languages. Such a regime is called complete and symmetric.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Relay means interpreting via a third \`bridging\' language: language
    A is first put into language B, then into C by interpreters working
    from B.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Retour means the same interpreter who works from language A into B
    also works from language B into A

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In an asymmetric regime, delegates can speak more languages than
    they can listen to. When we say a meeting has an 11-3 regime it
    means that delegates may speak all 11 official languages but that
    interpretation is only provided into 3 languages, say English,
    French and

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Reduced regime means that interpretation is provided from less than
    the full number of official languages. A meeting with an
    EN-FR-DE-IT-EL - EN-EL is called a 5-2 meeting, a meeting where
    delegates may speak English, French, German, Italian or Greek but
    interpretation is provided only into English and Greek. Such a
    meeting has a reduced asymmetric regime. It is foreseen that reduced
    and/or asymmetric regimes may become more common after enlargement
    in 2004.

###  {#section_9}

### 2. What it costs {#what_it_costs}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Figures from \"Giving you a voice in Europe\" (DG SCIC 2004):*

Additional cost of interpretation after enlargement, in 2 scenarios,
based on 200 working days per year at EU 666 per day:

-   5 teams per day per language to ensure minimum coverage: 30 000 days
    or EUR 19 980 000/year
-   40 interpreters per day per language (40 interpreters x 9): 72 000
    days = EUR 47 952 000/year

The Interpretation DG\'s current annual total cost is EUR 105 000 000 or
EUR 0.28 per citizen of the Union. Taking the minimalist option, the
cost will actually be reduced to EUR 0.27 per citizen per year. When we
reach full cruising speed of 40 interpreters per day, the cost will
increase to EUR 0.31 per citizen. Until then, the actual cost will be
somewhere between the two figures.

A [Comment
](http://europa.eu.int/comm/scic/thescic/multilingualism_en.htm "wikilink")
by SCIC (Last updated: 29-08-2002)

\-\--\>

The comment is often made that the European Union is on its way to
become a Babel of incomprehension at huge cost because of the many
languages we work with. It is then proposed to reduce the number of
languages. The number of languages is, of course, a political decision
but there are a number of issues that makes reduction across the board
difficult.

-   Democratic legitimacy of decision-making;
-   The need to actually understand what is being said by others;
-   The Member State governments each work in their national language.
    If there is no interpretation in Brussels there would need to be
    more translation in the Member States;
-   Political difficulty in deciding which languages to cut;
-   A central service ensures uniform quality across the many languages;
-   Economy of scale of central hiring of free-lance interpreters;
-   Relatively low cost of language services (all translation and
    interpretation in the European Union institutions cost per citizen
    in 2000 = the cost of a cup of coffee).

###  {#section_10}

### 3. Future development {#future_development}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second main objective of DG SCIC is to prepare to meet these
challenges. We want to be certain that we get the right technical
solutions that will ensure efficient communication in meetings,
cost-effectiveness and excellent working conditions. In order to pursue
this objective, the SCIC created a unit for Conference Interpretation
and New Technology in 2000. It coordinates more than 100 volunteer
(interpreter) members of staff who take part in exploring and testing
new communication tools and searching for ways to bring multilingualism
to new channels of communication. On the one hand, we intend to make
choices with full knowledge of the facts and not under the pressures of
industry or of financial interests other than those of the Institutions.
On the other hand, in a field that is likely to have a profound
influence on the work situation, it would be counter-productive to
improvise simplistic solutions without consulting the interested
parties. The work of the unit is currently focused on 8 fields:

-   multilingual chats on the Internet;
-   multilingual communication in the media;
-   multilingual virtual conferences;
-   language engineering (speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, etc.)
