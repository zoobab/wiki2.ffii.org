*19 April 2005 \-- In an answer to an inquiry from the European
Parliament, the European Commission claims that software patents have
been helpful for small and medium enterprises in the United States. The
Commission bases its claim solely on \"economic study\" that the
Commission had ordered from a group of patent lawyers in 2000. While
providing no evidence to support the claim, this study boldly makes it
in its executive summary. The dubious methodology of the study had been
pointed out by scientists, including one of the authors of the study
itself, several years ago. Yet the Commission continues to cite this
study in order to justify its pro-software-patent policies.*

## What the Commission did not tell him {#what_the_commission_did_not_tell_him}

-   EU-Commission study [IPI 2000: The Economic Impact of Patentability
    of Computer
    Programs](http://swpat.ffii.org/papri/indprop-ipi00/index.en.html "wikilink") -
    the economist who wrote the short section in that study on Economics
    complained that the executive summary made false conclusions from
    his part of the paper which was indeed very sceptical. Unlike the
    name of the paper suggests it was largely written by UK legal
    researchers.

`p.8: "As shown in our economic study of the literature (Section III of our report), most economists `\
`have doubts whether economic efficiency, i.e. increased overall welfare, is achieved by having or `\
`making computer program related inventions patentable. This caution is supported by the continuing,`\
`indeed growing, concern in the USA on the issues surrounding patents on computer program related `\
`inventions. The debate in the States is not finished."`

## Commission written answer (2005-04-14) {#commission_written_answer_2005_04_14}

The Commission\'s analysis and studies, reported in the Explanatory
Memorandum to the Commission proposal (COM (2002) 92 final), took into
account patents granted by the European Patent Office as well as those
granted by national patent offices of the EU Member States.

One of the studies conducted in the context of the Commission\'s
analysis, taking account of the situation in the United States, found
that \"the patentability of computer program related inventions has
helped the growth of computer program related industries in the United
States, in particular the growth of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and
independent software developers into sizable indeed major companies\".

The study also concluded that in Europe there is increasing, even though
still relatively low, use by independent software developers of patents
in raising finance or in licensing. The authors of the study considered
that harmonisation on the basis of the status quo would have no
consequence save for the important one that [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and
independent software developers will be less likely to consider computer
program related inventions unpatentable.

The Commission proposal seeks to clarify the legal rules on
patentability for software-related inventions. This does not include
computer programmes or other software as such. It means inventions which
make a technical contribution and which are truly novel.

Such inventions are present in a number of everyday consumer goods such
as cars, mobile telephones and domestic appliances. The Commission\'s
intention in making its proposal was to avoid patenting of pure software
and clearly differentiate the EU from the US. Nothing that is not
patentable now will be made patentable by the directive and its impact
on innovation and competition, as well as on European businesses, will
anyhow be monitored by the Commission (draft Article 7).

With regard to the second question of the honourable member of the
Parliament, as stated earlier, the Commission found that patentability
of software related inventions contributed to the growth of SME\'s and
independent developers. Exclusions of fields of technology from
patentability are undesirable as a matter of policy.

## Comments

### Commission study about effects on \"the patentability of computer-program related inventions\" {#commission_study_about_effects_on_the_patentability_of_computer_program_related_inventions}

\"One of the studies conducted in the context of the Commissions
analysis, taking account of the situation in the United States, found
that the patentability of computer program related inventions has
helped the growth of computer program related industries in the United
States, in particular the growth of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and
independent software developers into sizable indeed major companies

See above or read that paper for the Commission: [IPI 2000: The Economic
Impact of Patentability of Computer
Programs](http://swpat.ffii.org/papri/indprop-ipi00/index.en.html "wikilink").

In that economic part of the study we find, p. 32

`"The economics literature does not show that the balance of positive and negative effects lies `\
`with the negative. All it says is that there are grounds for supposing that the negative forces `\
`are stronger relative to the positive forces in this area than in some others and that any move `\
`to strengthen IP protection in the software industry cannot claim to rest on solid economic evidence."`

Remember Brian Crowley\'s question answered by the Commission above?

`"When carrying out that analysis and comparison, did the Commission find any indication that the absence of such patents  `\
`seriously restricts innovation and technological developments by `[`SMEs`](SMEs "wikilink")` in the sector?"`

### \"Exclusions of fields of technology from patentability are undesirable as a matter of policy.\" {#exclusions_of_fields_of_technology_from_patentability_are_undesirable_as_a_matter_of_policy.}

Application of Patent law in a specific field has to be justified, not
\"exclusions from patentability\". The EU-Commission reverses the burden
of proof. Patent law actually is an incentive system, the lawmaker
restricts the free market in order to reach certain effects. Provided
conditions are met.

### \"Nothing that is not patentable now will be made patentable by the directive\" {#nothing_that_is_not_patentable_now_will_be_made_patentable_by_the_directive}

-   i.e. codifying the legal escape at the EPO that removed all barriers
    (Computer Program Product IBM, Vicom) and has not proper legal
    foundation yet.

### \"This does not include computer programmes or other software as such.\" {#this_does_not_include_computer_programmes_or_other_software_as_such.}

\"Computer-Implemented Inventions\" according to the Commission\'s
proposed definitions are nothing but software.

### \"Such inventions are present in a number of everyday consumer goods such as cars, mobile telephones and domestic appliances.\" {#such_inventions_are_present_in_a_number_of_everyday_consumer_goods_such_as_cars_mobile_telephones_and_domestic_appliances.}

\"Computer-Implemented Inventions\" according to the European
Commission\'s definition refer to software running on general purpose
computers. \"Cars, \... and domestic applicances\" are normally not
claimed.

### \"seeks to clarify the legal rules on patentability for software-related inventions\" {#seeks_to_clarify_the_legal_rules_on_patentability_for_software_related_inventions}

Lawmaking is the role of the legislator. Clarification is needed,
indeed. But EU lawmaking led to even more obfuscation by use of
terminology such as \"software as such\", \"Computer-implemented
inventions\" and so forth. E.g. [BGH-lawyer Mellulis
2002](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/melullis02/index.de.html "wikilink")
strongly criticised the original proposal of the Commission.

` Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass auf der Basis des aktuellen`\
` Rechts `[`des`` ``EPÜ`` ``und`` ``deutschen`` ``Patentrechts`](d.h. "wikilink")` eine Grundlage für`\
` einen umfassenden Patentschutz für Software nicht zu erkennen`\
` ist. ... Die Richtlinie der Kommission der Europäischen Gemeinschaft,`\
` die erst nach Abschluss des vorliegenden Manuskripts zugänglich`\
` geworden ist, genügt diesem Anspruch `[`Interessenabwägung`](der "wikilink")` nicht;`\
` sie ist zudem mit ihrer weitgehenden Bejahung einer Patentierung von`\
` Software so nicht in das System des EPÜ einzuordnen.`

Clarification does not mean unlimited patentability.

### \"Commission found that patentability of software related inventions contributed to the growth of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and independent developers.\" {#commission_found_that_patentability_of_software_related_inventions_contributed_to_the_growth_of_smes_and_independent_developers.}

How? On what empirical basis?
