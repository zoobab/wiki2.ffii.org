*The dichotomy of \"copyright for literary creation, patents for
technical invention\" has visibly broken down due to the appearance of
software and the debate about copyrightability vs patentability for
software. It is time for an integrated redesign of the
intellectual/industrial property (i2p) system. Recent experience shows
that copyright comes closer to what is needed than patent law. Future
exclusion rights should be Fast, Cheap, Narrow. Initially they should be
biased in favor of the rightholder, but the burden should shift soon.*

## Copyright is (close to) the \"Intellectual/Industrial Property\" (I2P) Paradigm of the Future {#copyright_is_close_to_the_intellectualindustrial_property_i2p_paradigm_of_the_future}

-   Salient features of copyright are: low burden, narrow claims,
    proximity to the natural innovation incentive system (\"fast, cheap,
    narrow\")
-   Copyright is already the main IP system for non-esthetic creations
    such as instruction manuals, software, architecture and, to varying
    degrees in different jurisdictions, functional industrial design. It
    is considered to be appropriate for logical creations (as opposed to
    \"[ technical inventions](SwpatkorcuEn "wikilink")\" in the
    classical patent theory). Currently many people observe
    \"convergence\" of both, and the trend is to solve more problems at
    the level of logical creations.
-   Publication of claims and disclosure at an early stage impose
    burdens and disrupt rather than support the natural system of
    innovation incentives based on fast movement, business secret,
    competition etc
-   There may be some exceptional areas where codification of claims
    with their inevitable corrolary of early disclosure and cumbersome
    procedures could still be justifiable in the future. These are
    related to special circumstances where high burdens are already
    imposed by facts such as
    -   -   governmental safety certification requirements (e.g.
            clinical testing)
        -   expensive experimentation with forces of nature (classical
            domain of \"technical invention\")

## Features of future Integrated System of I2P {#features_of_future_integrated_system_of_i2p}

-   immediate acquisition of right, low costs, narrow claims
    (\"individual creation\")
-   low initial burden for rightholder, burden shifting from Public to
    rightholder over time
-   burden of proof on the suspected plagiator during an initial period
    (e.g. 2 years)
-   broad interpretation of scope of \"individual creation\" during
    initial period
-   no need for disclosure of plans/source/ideas at the beginning (see
    discussion below)
-   after a few years (e.g. 3-10) have elapsed, prolongation justifies a
    burden, including registration, disclosure, and from some point on
    increasing renewal fees
-   [ registration, renewal, disclosure, examination etc need to be
    handled by private parties according to standards approved by the
    government](PatexamReformEn "wikilink")
-   low complexity, care to avoid creation of special interest groups
    that hijack the legislative process

## Early disclosure, an advantage of the patent system ? {#early_disclosure_an_advantage_of_the_patent_system}

Patents are touted to be \"deal\" of \"monopoly for disclosure\", where
society benefits by having the \"invention\" disclosed at an early
stage.

In reality, a monopoly **cannot** be granted without disclosure. Broad
claims need to be codified and publicly scrutinised. What is touted as a
deal is a **necessary feature** of any monpoly right rather than
something for which there was a demand by the public.

If broad monopoly rights are not granted by a future \"fast, cheap,
narrow\" i2p system, there is also less of a need for disclosure.

Yet, even in a \"Fast, Cheap, Narrow\" i2p system, the rightholder often
has an interest in being able to prove when he made his achievement, and
disclosure will help him. Competition will build further incentives for
disclosure.

In the case of software, object code can usually not be decompiled in a
meaningful way. Decompilation does not seriously lessen the first mover
advantage, because it does not provide a useful result to the
competitor. Much of the advantages of the original achiever are based on
this type of informal property right, and society has little interest in
obtaining the source code at an early stage. For the initial 1-2 years,
even a decompilation ban might not hurt.

This can be generalised to logical creations, and even in engineering in
the applied natural sciences, there is something like a difference
between the conceptual level (source code), to which the originator has
early access, and a level of more or less intransparent work results. It
is said that chromatography makes this difference very small, but this
probably has to be investigate more closely \-- after all the software
patent lobby also tends to exaggerate the power of decompilation in
software. In any case, often the public\'s interest in early disclosure
is fairly low compared to the public\'s interest in leaving natural
market incentives for creation/innovation undisturbed.
