## Introduction, General Observations {#introduction_general_observations}

Do not confuse with 1977 \"Patent Act\", which is the UK\'s general
patent law and contains the UK implementation of the European Patent
Convention.

The main aims of the 2004 \"Patents Act\" seem to be

-   facilitation of patent enforcement
-   involvement of the UK Patent Office in this work

It\'s clear that the [ Patent Defence
Union](PatentDefenceUnionEn "wikilink") seems to have got its message
over quite successfully. Many !MPs now favor legislation that would
subsidise aggressive patent enforcement strategies such as those of PDU
founder Mitchell of [ Allvoice](SwxaiAllvoiceEn "wikilink"). Similar
legislation was proposed by [ Arlene
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink") in summer
of 2003 in an attempt to sway opposition by the !MEPs to her pro-patent
course and appear more SME-friendly.

Even in the [new improved
presentation](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2004-06-07.39.0 "wikilink"),
it\'s a pretty lengthy read, for not an awful lot of enlightenment, but
quite revealing for some of the broader views taken by !MPs on patents
(or rather: by the handful of interested !MPs).
