*Members of the European Parliament successfully opposed a move by
German MEP Klaus Werner Lehne to jeopardise the annual Lisbon report. At
a plenary vote* !MEPs *rejected proposals asking the Commission for
mutual recognition of patent law, which would have resulted in a flood
of patent suits all over Europe, lower quality standards, worsening the
software patent problem.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strasbourg (March 15, 2006) \-- The new round of the European debate on
patent policy has started with a first victory for anti-software patent
campaigners. A majority of the European Parliament today voted against
calling on the European Commission for a legislative proposal to
stipulate the mutual recognition of national patents by the 25 member
states of the EU. Such mutual recognition would make the patents that
the national patent office of any EU country grants enforceable against
companies in all other member states.

The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) and Florian
Mueller, the founder of the
[NoSoftwarePatents](NoSoftwarePatents "wikilink").com campaign, lobbied
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") to vote against the related passage of a
proposed resolution, stressing that the mutual recognition of national
patents \"would result in a flood of patent suits all over Europe, lower
quality standards, and ever more software patents\", among other things
because patent applicants would \"shop around\" to find patent offices
that are most willing to grant patents which would then be valid in the
entire EU.

The call for mutual recognition of patents that had been sponsored by
Klaus Heiner Lehne MEP. Lehne, a German conservative, [ job as a
lobbyist with the law firm Taylor
Wessing](KlausHeinerLehneEn "wikilink"), which handles many cases of
patent litigation especially in his home town of Dusseldorf and
represents large corporations in many areas of commercial law.

Mueller called the outcome of today\'s vote in the European Parliament
\"excellent news from Strasbourg\". His [recently started
blog](http://www.no-lobbyists-as-such.com/florian-mueller-blog "wikilink")
also explains the voting mechanism, a so-called split vote, that
prevented the text from going through as proposed by Lehne. Mueller
published large parts of a memorandum that Lehne had written to other EU
politicians late last year and in which the MEP claimed that the mutual
recognition of national patents would make Europe more competitive. By
calling on the European Commission to make a proposal for the mutual
recognition of patents, the European Parliament would not have taken a
final legislative decision today, but such a call \"would have been a
disappointing start for \[anti-software patent campaigners\] with
respect to the EU\'s new patent policy initiative, and it would have had
negative effects for the future\", he added.

Benjamin Henrion of the FFII welcomes the European Parliament\'s
decision because this way the parliament \"keeps all options open for
the future of the European patent system\" in light of the European
Commission\'s [ongoing consultation on patent
policy](http://consultation.ffii.org/ "wikilink"), which is preparatory
to new legislative proposals that EU observers expect the Commission to
put forward after the summer. Henrion said it would have been \"a pity
if Lehne\'s proposal had slipped through as one of 67 items of a
resolution on the EU\'s Lisbon Agenda for innovation and economic
policy\".

Rufus Pollock, director of FFII UK, calls on companies and individuals
who are concerned about software patents to participate in the EU\'s
consultation on patent policy: \"Today was a great result for us, but
there will be many more and bigger challenges ahead as the Commission
prepares new proposals concerning patent policy. It\'s very important
that many companies and individuals write to the Commission before the
deadline on March 31. Answering the [Commission\'s
questionnaire](http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/indprop/patent/consultation_en.htm "wikilink")
is tricky, but the FFII has set up a [Web site that provides further
explanation](http://consultation.ffii.org "wikilink"), or people can
also use [Müller\'s position
paper](http://www.no-lobbyists-as-such.com/florian-mueller-blog/position-paper/ "wikilink")
and submit it in their name.\"

Today\'s resolution of the European Parliament was based on motion
B6-0162/2006, which had been jointly introduced by the chairpersons of
the three largest groups in the parliament (EPP-ED, PES, ALDE).

At the request of EPP-ED and ALDE, paragraph 43 was subject to a split
vote. The proposed text without the words \"small\" and \"mutual
recognition\" was carried, while a majority voted against proposals to
insert those words.

Piia-Noora Kauppi MEP took the initiative in the EPP-ED group meeting
yesterday evening to have her group support the text which was carried
today.
