## General notes from the seminar {#general_notes_from_the_seminar}

-   must \"bring\" economic value to the patent system (so it does not
    have now?)
-   granting is for economic value and for the interest of society
-   legal certainity depends on the quality
-   \"rigid\" examination by expert scientists, three examiners
-   most patents are reduced in scope before granting
-   \"opposition procedure\" guarantees quality
    -   -   Note:doesn\'t M\$ apply for two patents per day, who shall
            do the the \"guard\" for the EPO?

## Wolfgang Pilch {#wolfgang_pilch}

-   is principal director of patent information
-   innovation is not over when product is developed, it is over when it
    is sold
-   Stressed that all documents are \"available free of charge\"
    -   -   Note: searching however can have high cost and be a big
            problem\...
-   Stressed that Universities seem to have the \"Not invented here\"
    problem while companies look if somebody has done the same before
    (look into the patents first)

## Stefan Steinbrenner {#stefan_steinbrenner}

EPO is under two contraints:

-   current law
-   what people are applying (what the customer wants)
    -   -   Note: Shouldn\'t the EPO act like a public authority which
            simply implements the law and not like a private company
            which follows what it\'s customers (the applicants for
            patents) want, yet regretfully bound by law, seeing law as a
            \"contraint\"?

-   TBA had 20 cases in 5 years, before there were 20 cases in 20 years
-   Board 351 decides and other Boards decided to be in line with the
    decisions of Board 351, so \"European case so appears to be
    harmonized\"

Described the EPC/EPO relationship and it boiled down to:

-   EPC: \"as such\"
-   EPO: \"not technical\" (of course he didn\'t say it in this way)
    -   -   Note: But technical is a principle of EPC, so if \"as such\"
            meant \"technical\" the word \"technical\" would have been
            used.
