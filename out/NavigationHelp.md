-   Use the **Changes** function to find out which pages have been
    edited lately.
-   The [SiteMap](SiteMap "wikilink") function lists all pages in
    alphabetical order
-   The **Search** box let\'s you search the full text of kwiki pages

## How to create a new page {#how_to_create_a_new_page}

You would like to create a new page that is not attached to a static
FFII page?

Decide on its name (for example
[MyIndependentPage](MyIndependentPage "wikilink")) and **just use the
name** in an existing page that you are editing. You will have created a
link to your new page. Your new page is of course still empty - you can
now click its Edit button and add some text. It works like this in every
Wiki and the concept is so simple that sometimes it is hard to grasp by
computer geeks.
