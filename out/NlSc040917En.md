### From Blasum\'s IRC summary (adapted): {#from_blasums_irc_summary_adapted}

\- Background: FFII NL Arend Lammertink

\- Housing: Offer by Arend farmhouse (simple, but has net) in Twente,
central NL, for Fr 17-Mo 20 Sept. The place is near
<http://www.koprensmorre.nl> (adjacent building), Markelo, Twente, The
Netherlands. It\'s good reachable by public transportation. If you take
the train to \"Holten\", it\'s only about 10-15 minutes by bus, which
stops within 200m of the place.

\- Content: Discussions/Socializing: will happen anyway, education:
lectures on legal texts and interpretations were suggesting, possibly
also on how to use mlht or cps3 or other topics

\- \'Scale\': it was raised whether it would be better to have this more
on a regional scale (reducing travel efforts) in several places (in that
case the 17-20 Sept would be mainly for benelux,de), or more centrally.
This was left open for further discussion. Another factor determining
\'scale\' was the availability of lectures and lecturers.
