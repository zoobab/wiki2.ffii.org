*6th July 2005 \-- The FFII has registered the domain
power-to-the-parliament.org and pre-registered
power-to-the-parliament.eu.*

The site should help strengthen the European Parliament in its struggle
against disrespectful ministerial bureaucrat and encourage it to say No
to sleazy legislative proposals more quickly in the future.

The first immediate content of the site could be a thank you to those
members of the European Parliament who worked in this sense in the case
of the software patent directive.

Starting on 7th of July, the domain
[power-to-the-parliament.org](http://www.power-to-the-parliament.org/ "wikilink")
preliminarily points to the swpat.ffii.org website.
