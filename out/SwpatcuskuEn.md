### 2000-09-19-23 10th European Patent Judges Symposium Luxembourg Paul VAN DEN BERG {#th_european_patent_judges_symposium_luxembourg_paul_van_den_berg}

It is already a long time ago that patent examiners in patent offices of
Europe at the mere discovery in a patent application of something, which
might have to do with a computer program, immediately decided to refuse
the application concerned without much ado. In the meantime the
situation has changed very much.

### IBM/Seebach on conflict between patent system and standardisation {#ibmseebach_on_conflict_between_patent_system_and_standardisation}

In some cases, a standard comes with some kind of licensing
restrictions, or involves something that someone has a patent on. For
instance, Unisys had a patent governing a bit of the algorithm used for
GIF images. In general, patents are a huge weakness for a standard. The
MP3 standard is used very widely by people who simply don\'t know \-- or
don\'t care \-- that someone theoretically has a patent on part of it,
and only some code using the patented algorithm actually has a license
from the patent holder. Developers and users can be bitten by this many
years after they make the design decision to use a patented algorithm,
due to the nature of patents (see Resources). De jure standards often
require contributors to clearly disclose any known patents; de facto
standards generally have no way to do this.

### Google lawyer: current patent system easy to abuse {#google_lawyer_current_patent_system_easy_to_abuse}

**Google executive Kulpreet Rana**, who looks after intellectual
property issues at the internet search firm, backs the need for reform
because he believes the present system makes it difficult to make good
business decisions.

/The ambiguity and lack of quality that we currently have really mainly
favours those who want to use patents as a tool for harassment. The
system, because of the way it works right now, is fairly easy to abuse./

### eBay lawyer: patents divert time to lawyers {#ebay_lawyer_patents_divert_time_to_lawyers}

-   Ebay\'s litigation and intellectual property professional, deputy
    general Jay Monahan\* has seen the number patent problems for his
    company grow steadily, including one for infringing a Virginia
    man\'s patent of selling auctioned items at a fixed price. Ebay has
    come to think of the patent trolls as \"an unfortunate cost of doing
    business\", he says.

/It\'s driven ebay\'s costs up and it diverts time and resources from
building the world\'s greatest ecommerce platform. There are dollars
spent on lawyers. There\'s also an impact on diverting in-house legal
staff, engineers, people at all levels to produce documents and sit for
depositions. Our approach to this point has been to vigorously defend
ourselves against these claims and not to pay ransom money if you will./

## Comments on existing Quotes {#comments_on_existing_quotes}

Concerning two of the quotations, Geza wonders whether they are
appropriate:

### Bradford Friedmann (Cadence) {#bradford_friedmann_cadence}

#### geza question {#geza_question}

<http://swpat.ffii.org/archiv/zitate/index.en.html#cadence02> seems to
argue in favor of [SwPats](SwPats "wikilink"): he acknowledges
\"animosity\" but then regrets that the industry has \"relied on other
[patents](not "wikilink") more market-oriented drivers of innovation\"
and states that he believs this is a \"missed opportunity for
accelerating \... growth\".

Why do we quote this?

#### phm answer {#phm_answer}

because the \"regretting\" talk seems to be merely a gesture of
submissiveness toward an audience which is expected to be very
pro-patent. Translated to less submissive language, it reads \"Although
I can see that some people want more than market-oriented drivers and
their idealism is understandable, reality has proven those drivers
unworkable and it\'s now time to turn to reality\". This quote is in
more useful than the Google/Ebay quotes which can be understood as
narrowly criticising the patent office\'s inability to assess prior art
or non-obviousness in the case of business-method patents.

### The Alcatel quotation {#the_alcatel_quotation}

#### geza question {#geza_question_1}

<http://swpat.ffii.org/archiv/zitate/index.en.html#swpatalcatel> appears
to be just an excerpt from the usual gloomy
list-all-catastrophes-that-might-befall-us-and-then-some disclaimer at
the end of a quarterly/annual report. It talks in very general terms
about problems Alcatel might have with patents (or other \"intellectual
property\") claims of any sort (not just [SwPat](SwPat "wikilink")).
(\"Our business \... will be harmed if we are unable to acquire licenses
\... on reasonable terms.\")

IMHO this adds nothing to the [SwPat](SwPat "wikilink") discussion;
moreover, one can find similar paragraphs in the 10-Q\'s,10-K\'s of
nearly every company.

#### phm answer {#phm_answer_1}

Still the standard SEC language shows that patents are a source of
danger, even for Alcatel. If they weren\'t it wouldn\'t be written
there.
