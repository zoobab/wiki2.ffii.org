    course on a somewhat smaller scale
-   If a member in a political party then you can make use your contacts

## How to encourage people {#how_to_encourage_people}

-   Tell them something like \"If you don\'t like something of FFII,
    help us! We can\'t do better without having more resources
    (humanly - personal, good-wise e.g. computing resources) and
    funding-wise.\" I want to cite Larry Lessig from his speech at
    OSCON: \"Don\'t help us by wining, help us by writing on a cheque:
    \'Please be more\...\'; send mail to \_\_proj-help at ffii org\_\_
    for help offers.\"
-   \"If you have a complete resource to offer (eg. a new wiki system -
    like a mediawiki install so that we can replace kwiki for example)
    please don\'t write to us yes \... is great, use that, but send us
    the host name of the server which we can relyably use (backed up and
    you restore it from an always current backup if needed), hosted and
    administered and your contact information so that we can contact you
    when we have questions.\"
