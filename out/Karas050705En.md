Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Dear Colleagues! After this two hours of
debate does anyone have the impression that we have a usable common
position? After this debate does anyone have the impression that this
tricky question has been debated enough, that it is ripe for decision,
that we do have the necessary qualified majority for Yes or to the
plenitude of amendments? I do not think so. And there is a reason for
that.

The first reading on 24 September 2004 was not taken into account at all
when it came to the political agreement of the council. Piia-Noora
Kauppi said on the council decision, apparently the council wanted to
ignore the will of the elected european legislators. The council itself
is not secure. The item had been removed from the agenda on 21 December
on the request of Poland. Parliaments in Germany, Spain and the
Netherlands have spoken against the directive in its current form.
Votings have been delayed several times.

The European Parliament has asked the Commision for a resubmittal in
First Reading. We have a decision of the Legal Affairs Council (JURI), a
decision of the Conference of Presidents, a decision of the plenary for
a renewed referral.

How did the council react on that? The council has stopped all
discussion by declaring it A item hence quenching all discussions. Even
if the Nice treaty become law in the meanwhile the political agreement
was simply approved. Result: one is unhappy about the common position
and we now have 178 amendments.

From the subject matter point of view \-\-- I could amend it - they are
mentioned in the amendments \-\-- I am convinced this common position
does not create legal security, it does not promote innovation and it
gives fear to the small companies. Hence it is wise to reject the common
position next and use all our forces for the harmonisation of European
Patent law instead for voting on disputed sectoral harmonisations as
substitute for that.
