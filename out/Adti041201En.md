Alexis de Tocqueville institution is a think tank, a hired gun that
provides studies on demand for industry groups. Usually the funding
organisation behing the campaign is not made public. As the News is
reported from SCO\'s [LinuxInsider](LinuxInsider "wikilink") it is not
that hard to guess who spreads the rumors. ADTI is part of the dirty
lobbying portfolio. As studies from this think tank have no credibility
we recommend you not to waste your precious time on arguing against it.

Alexis de Tocqueville is the name of a famous french philosopher from
enlightment who is very often quoted in the US.
