The [Moscowitz
paper](http://www.eifonline.org/site_16/fil/fil_23.pdf "wikilink") is
not located nor linked to at <http://cecua.org>, but found only on the
[main
page](http://www.eifonline.org/site/index.cfm?BID=16&SID=1&LG=2&HOMEP=1 "wikilink")
of
[EIF](http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=European_Internet_Foundation "wikilink"),
an organisation which organizes lobbying efforts of large companies.

The Moscowitz paper culminates in the demand that patent law should be
left to lawyers to determine.

[Alain
Moscowitz](http://www.google.de/search?q=Alain+Moscowitz&ie=UTF-8=UTF-8&hl=de&btnG=Google+Suche&meta= "wikilink")
was previously general secretary of the computer user association
Inforep and already in that function [spoke in favour of software
patents at an EIF meeting on
2002-01-12](http://www.legalis.net/cgi-iddn/french/affiche-tv.cgi?droite=tvpratique/brevet_logiciels.htm&player=player.htm "wikilink").
His statement was televised at the time.

We expect more \"[ joint statements](Ipat0304En "wikilink")\" of \"the
industry\" with \"associations representing millions of consumers in
Europe\", jointly asking for software patents and opposing the European
Parlament\'s vote, to be sent confidentially to heads of governments in
Europe, as has been done in recent months. Alain Moscowitz seems to be
playing the role of Graham Taylor.
