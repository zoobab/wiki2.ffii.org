# EU accession to the EPC needs assent from EP {#eu_accession_to_the_epc_needs_assent_from_ep}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An essential part of the Community patent is the European Union\'s
accession to the European Patent Convention. Such an accession is
executed under art 300 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community. The European Parliament has to be consulted, or has to give
assent. A essential difference. There are indications that accession to
the EPC can only be concluded after the assent of the European
Parliament has been obtained.

We take a look at the second subparagraph of Article 300(3):

\"By way of derogation from the previous subparagraph, agreements
referred to in Article 310, other agreements establishing a specific
institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, agreements
having important budgetary implications for the Community and agreements
entailing amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in
Article 251 shall be concluded after the assent of the European
Parliament has been obtained.\"

## Case law on 300(3) {#case_law_on_3003}

There has been a case about \"important budgetary implications\",
C-189/97, the EP went to the ECJ. The ECJ thought them not important
enough, the EP lost.

The Community Patent Court is directly related to accession to the EPC.
The
[proposal](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st05/st05189.en04.pdf "wikilink")
has a Financial Statement showing budgetary implications that can be
regarded as important.

Equally interesting is Case C-317/04, part of it is about \"infringement
of the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) EC, because Directive 95/46
was amended;\"

This question was never answered by the court, the agreement being
invalid for other reasons. There is only an opinion of Advocate General
Léger on it. Two quotes:

\"181. That said, it seems that the Court has not yet ruled on the
meaning to be given to the relatively vague expression amendment of an
act adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 251.\"

\"183. Generally speaking, I am of the opinion that, in order for there
to be amendment by an international agreement of an internal Community
act adopted under the codecision procedure, one of the conditions is
that the field of application of the agreement overlap with that of the
internal act. In that case, the internal act may be amended by the
international agreement, either if the agreement contains a provision
which conflicts with one of those of the internal act or because the
agreement adds to the content of the internal act, even when there is no
direct conflict.\"

There seem to be no cases on \"other agreements establishing a specific
institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures\".

## Comment Ante Wessels {#comment_ante_wessels}

### 1

The Community Patent Court is directly related to accession to the EPC.
The
[proposal](http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/04/st05/st05189.en04.pdf "wikilink")
has a Financial Statement showing budgetary implications that can be
regarded as important. Accession to the EPC can only be concluded after
the assent of the European Parliament has been obtained.

### 2 {#section_1}

The second subparagraph of Article 300(3) protects the European
Institutions. Important in this case is whether the European
Parliament\'s prerogatives are infringed. Following Advocate General
Léger\'s reasoning, this is the case if an \"internal act may be amended
by the international agreement, either if the agreement contains a
provision which conflicts with one of those of the internal act or
because the agreement adds to the content of the internal act, even when
there is no direct conflict.\"

The EPC definitely adds to the content of current internal acts.
Accession to the EPC can only be concluded after the assent of the
European Parliament has been obtained.

Furthermore, accession to the EPC will make the EPC Community law. As a
result subsequent changes of the European Patent Convention will also be
Community law. The European Parliament will have no influence on these
changes, its prerogatives will be infringed in the future too. While not
mentioned, an undermining of the constituting treaties of the Community
is an even more important reason for assent to be needed.

### 3 {#section_2}

The European Parliament could already ask for an Opinion by the ECJ (see
below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Opinion

Art 300.6 mentions the possibility to ask for an opinion.

\"\"6. The Council, the Commission or a Member State may obtain the
opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is
compatible with the provisions of this Treaty. Where the opinion of the
Court of Justice is adverse, the agreement may enter into force only in
accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.\"

Example:

Here is art 48:

48: \"The government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to
the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the
Union is founded. (\...) \"
