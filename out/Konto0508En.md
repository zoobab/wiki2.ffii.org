------------------------------------------------------------------------

*blasum suddenly left, jahleff is taking over the keys, a lot needs to
be done.*

## status

-   account signature rights with jahleff, phm, erjos
    -   -   transferred from blasum, wangtao, erjos
-   transfer of treasurer functions from blasum to jahleff seems to be
    working well

## To Do {#to_do}

-   !TANs and !PINs for <https://homebanking.sskm.de/> (almost obtained)
-   clarify access to Paypal, Moneybookers etc (blasum told jahleff
    orally)
-   payment to erjos announced, money transfer not completed (recieved)
    yet (5 banking days expected)
-   board needs to decide if separate account needs to be established
    for Brussels expenses
-   clarify list of payments due, especially urgent ones
-   draft statement which delineates jahleff and blasum responsibilities
-   issue board decision appointing jahleff
-   specify tasks for professional accountant (Lene Wagner et al)
    -   -   lac: before she got involved in open source solutions she
            was a full time bookkkeper.
        -   Lene is coming to Munich, possibly this week or next
        -   document transparently, with as little info hidden in paper
            and proprietary formats as possible.
        -   place data in web-accessible directory on genba, use
            password-protection (htaccess) and gnupg to secure
            confidentiality where needed
-   update <http://www.ffii.org/geld/kontakt/index.en.html>
-   who is konto\@ffii.org
    <http://www.ffii.org/geld/cpacu/index.en.html>

1.  1.  DONE: \* erjos will ask jahleff if he wants the card sent to him
        or otherwise faciliate his accounting work

### FFII UK {#ffii_uk}

-   clarify [situation with UK Paypal
    account](http://ffii.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Paypal050819 "wikilink")
    -   -   it seems the account can continue to receive payments for
            the time being
        -   Needs bank account in name of FFII UK before
            [PayPal](PayPal "wikilink") account becomes fully
            operational
