*27 December 2004 \-- India\'s Minister of Industry Kamal Nath has
issued an ordinance (a law that enters into force without prior
parliamentary approval) in order to greatly expand the patent system,
among other things by firmly establishing software patents in India.*

## Details

The
[ordinance](http://lawmin.nic.in/Patents%20Amendment%20Ordinance%202004.pdf "wikilink")
represents further amendment to the Indian [Patents Act
1970](http://ipindia.nic.in/ipr/patent/patAct1970-3-99.html "wikilink")
(see [ministry
gloss](http://www.indianembassy.org/Economy/1.htm "wikilink")).

Regarding software patents, its effect is to replace the following
clause, introduced in the [Patents (Amendment) Act
2002](http://ipindia.nic.in/ipr/patent/patentg.pdf "wikilink"),
specifying as excluded subject-matter:

-   3(k) a mathematical or business method or computer programme per se
    or algorithms;

by new clauses:

-   3(k) a computer programme per se other than its technical
    application to industry or a combination with hardware;
-   3(ka) a mathematical method or business method or algorithms;

It is not yet clear what immediate changes this would mean for e.g. the
[ Rules for Software Patentability](SwpatRulesInEn "wikilink") in the
Indian Patent Office\'s Manual of Patent Practice and Procedure.

The Indian Patent Office has, by stretching and twisting the present
law, already granted some pure software patents, and, from a short-term
perspective, there is grouds for the ministry to argue that they are
\"merely codifying the status quo\".

Similar changes were [proposed by the UK Patent Office as an alternative
to the faltering directive project in early
2002](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/ukpo-swpat0202/ "wikilink") and by
the [ Council\'s text of 2004-05-18](Cons040518En "wikilink"). The trick
consists in redefining the exclusion of computer programs from
patentability so that what is typically claimed in patents, namely \"a
computer program, characterised by \[ some way of improving efficiency
in the use of conventional computing equipment \]\", is not deemed to be
a computer program (per se), and the exclusion becomes meaningless.

The ministry says that the ordinance is needed for implementing !TRIPs
requirements, for \"adapting to the practice of our major trading
partners\", for \"harmonising the practice of regional patent offices\".
While the ministry says that the software industry needs patents, it
claims that these \"only cover software products, not the algorithms as
such\", or even \"only embedded software\" (i.e. software \"embedded\"
in a general-purpose computer). Nath\'s patent officials seem to have
learnt the whole European repertoire of tricks and lies. The ordinance
enters into force on 2005-01-01, but lapses automatically on 2005-07-01
unless it gains parliamentary confirmation. The question of product
patents for drugs, apparently without any of the flexibilities made
allowable under the WTO Doha round, has raised particular widespread
concern, especially among the Left and Communist parties, the partners
of Nath\'s Congress party in the governing coalition. The issues are
therefore still very much up for grabs; discussion of them in the Indian
parliament is resuming in March 2005.

Proposals for amending the Nath Ordinance and for clarifying the meaning
of !TRIPs so as to clearly exclude software patents and lead the Indian
Patent Office back onto a healthy course have been made:

-   [ Letter of MEP David Hammerstein](Hammerstein050321En "wikilink")
