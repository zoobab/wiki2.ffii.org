According to a [CNet
article](http://news.com.com/2100-1012_3-5261459.html "wikilink"), Adobe
Inc has been taken to court by a company called \"Information Technology
Innovation\" for infringement of their patent [US
5,892,908](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,892,908.WKU.&OS=PN/5,892,908&RS=PN/5,892,908 "wikilink")
in software related to its Acrobat Reader.

Family search at [Depatisnet](http://www.depatisnet.de/ "wikilink")
suggests that US 5,892,908 has no EP cousins, but many similar patents
have been granted by the EPO.
