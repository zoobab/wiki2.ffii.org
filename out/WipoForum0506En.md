*From June 1st to 15th, 2005, the World Intellectual Property
Organisation (WIPO) will host a public online forum, as a part of the
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). Everyone can post a
comment about 10 themes. Each theme is accompanied by a text serving as
a basis for reflexion.*

-   [Home page of the public online
    forum](http://www.wipo.int/ipisforum/en/ "wikilink")

Two themes are particularly relevant for software patents :

-   Theme 2 : [The intellectual property system and freedom of
    expression and creativity: Help or
    hindrance?](http://www.wipo.int/roller/comments/ipisforum/Weblog/theme_two_the_intellectual_property "wikilink")

A remark is about software patents:

\"In the field of software, copyright and patent protection may act to
prevent any one operating system from becoming a de facto standard.\"

-   Theme 3 : [The public domain and open access models of information
    creation: at odds with the intellectual property system or enabled
    by
    it?](http://www.wipo.int/roller/comments/ipisforum/Weblog/theme_three_the_public_domain "wikilink")

In this theme, the software patents apprear twice:

In the presentation, paragraph 7b:

\"While patents grant exclusive rights to owners, it is clearly in their
interests to place the invention on the market at a price that the
market will absorb. \[\...\] Another strategic choice may be to release
patents into the public domain, as was done some months ago by IBM, with
a view to enhance the development of new products, in particular, in the
software area by giving free access to certain technologies to other
developers of the technology in question.\"

In the questions to consider:

\"Are patent rights (e.g., software patents) consistent with need for
interoperability in the Information Society?\"
