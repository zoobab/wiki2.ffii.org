Mr. Sioufas is currently the greek minister of Development. He is
affiliated with the party of New Democracy (Christian Democrats). At the
time of this writing (2004-05-16) the main attention needs to be focused
on him, since he is the one who will be voting in the Council of
Ministers on behalf of Greece on Tuesday, 2004-5-17.

In the voting of September 2003 of the European Parliament, the
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") that represent New Democracy (the party of Mr.
Sioufas), voted against software patents, stating clearly that they
agree on putting strict limits on what should be patented. We hope that
Mr. Sioufas will agree with his colleagues and vote against software
patents, on the vote of the Council on Tuesday 2004-5-17.

The minister\'s decision is based on input from his advisors in the
ministery, and in particular of Industrial Property Organisation
(O.B.I. - which is a body of the ministery of Development too).
Hopefully, fellow party members will manage to persuade him to vote
against software patents, protecting this way the competitiveness of
Small and Medium Enterprises, which powers mainly the Greek and European
Informatics world.

It would be of great surprise and disappointment if Mr. Sioufas votes in
favour of software patents, since he is known as a [very strong
supporter](http://news.antenna.gr/articleDetail/0,3091,82785,00.html "wikilink")
of innovation and competitiveness. In his recent speech at the Greek
Parliament, he
[stated](http://www.parliament.gr/sioufas/prosklhsh_23_3_04.htm "wikilink"):
\"Competitiveness is the main precondition for development. But to
succeed a high and viable competitiveness, it needs to be founded on the
quality dimension of the prolific system\". We hope he will remain
strong to his ideas by voting against software patents.

## Industrial Property Organisation (OBI) {#industrial_property_organisation_obi}

<http://www.gsrt.gr/default.asp?FILE=items/2453/189>

OBI is the body that advices the minster on the software patents issues.
Although OBI is fully supporting patents (since it is the body that
issues patents in Greece), we hope that they will agree with the
minister\'s positions about spread of innovation and competitiveness of
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") (small and medium enterprises), and oppose
software patents. Since OBI had no meeting yet with the activists in
Greece about software patents, and Greece being the home of democracy,
all sides could be heard by asking at least a delay for his vote, so
that Greece could decide on something that all greeks will agree.

It is no secret that Mr. Bolkestein is a staunch supporter of software
patents. He is the European Commissioner reponsible for \"Internal
Market\" affairs and therefore wields a lot of influence. Frits
Bolkestein recently announced that he would be resigning from his post
as Commissioner this year. A more detailed profile on him can be read on
[this older
