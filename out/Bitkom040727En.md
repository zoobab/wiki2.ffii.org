Complains that the object of patenting is \"misleadingly\" called
\"software\" instead of \"computer-implemented inventions\", says this
will lead to biased results.

The German government launched an industry survey on july 15th in which
it asks all kinds of companies to estimate the cost and benefits of
patenting software on their company. Bitkom is one of the associations
that were asked for cooperation in conducting the survey.

Previously Bitkom had relentlessly lobbied for [ program
claims](EubsaProgEn "wikilink"), stressing that software as such should
receive patent \"protection\", because the \"software industry\" is a
\"multi billion euro business\" and should no longer be disadvantaged
with regard to \"other industries\". It is however clear that Bitkom has
never asked its member companies about the economic implications of
patenting and in fact does not want such questions to be asked. Bitkom
had treated the subject as a legal matter, to be decided among corporate
patent lawyers within its \"industrial property committee\". Decisions
in this committee have regularly been taking by voting among 7-8 lawyers
from IBM, Siemens, Microsoft, HP, Sun, Giesecke & Devrient etc.

Bitkom conducted a poll among its members in 2002, consisting of
questions such as \"would you rather own many or few patents?\",
according to which, by Bitkom\'s logic, FFII would end up being counted
as a supporter of software patentability. Yet even this fuzzy Bitkom
poll showed a large majority of Bitkom members \"against US-style
software patenting\". In spite of Bitkom\'s statements to the contrary,
Bitkom is currently lobbying for the imposition of US-style software
patentability on Europe.
