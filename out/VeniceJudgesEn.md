            highest court, Dr. Klaus-Jurgen Melullis, has recently once
            more stressedthat without this definition the courts have no
            reliable way to exclude patents on abstractconcepts and
            business methods these days. At the same time, Melullis
            stressed that thedefinition alone does not exclude much. It
            is just a basis. On this basis, almost anypatent can be
            granted. To really exclude software and business methods,
            additionalelements need to come in, namely the concept of
            invention or
            contribution](http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:uGrZKc1AmtsJ:swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/amends05/juri0504/ffiiepp050615.pdf+Klaus-J%C3%BCrgen+Melullis+%22software+patent%22&hl=en&gl=fr&ct=clnk&cd=1 "wikilink")
