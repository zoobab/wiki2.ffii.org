## News & Chronology {#news_chronology}

-   2005-06-23 software patent meeting organised on behalf of [
    Microsoft proxy organisation BVMW](SwpatdmmvDe "wikilink") in Berlin
    (mostly pro-patent speakers, but strong counter-arguments from Lycos
    representative)
-   2005-06-16 [ Mail sent to [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink")
    2005](Pleon050616En "wikilink")

ECC Kohtes Klewes is doing PR for Microsoft since around 2002, after
Microsoft\'s former PR agency Hunzinger was made responsible for losing
Munich city desktop OS and German Bundestag server OS to Linux. Thus,
since the merger, Microsoft must have become a Pleon customer.

Many Pleon employees are also part of the <http://openbc.com/> network.

Their expertise is (of course):

-   Lobbying
-   Influencing- Communicating

They also have a \"task force\" for comunication crisis management. This
certainly looks like a last-minute intervention paid by Microsoft to
convince MEP of the \"importance\" of software patents for the !SMEs in
europe.

Several lobbying meetings in the European Parliament have been arranged
by Pleon. One of these appears to have been arranged on behalf of [
SAP](SwpatsapEn "wikilink").
