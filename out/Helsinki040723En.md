On the last stop of their Baltic tour RMS, Marco Schulze and Christian
Engström did their speeches before a Finnish audience in a roughly
half-filled auditorium (capacity 108 seats) in the capital region. As in
previous events RMS managed to capture the audience very well during his
speech. Unfortunately there was no time for any questions directed to
RMS as he had to rush to the airport directly after finishing his speech
in order to catch his flight back home. However, when Marco and
Christian were done with their speeches we had a reasonably active Q & A
session (which does not always happen in Finnish conditions). The exact
composition of the audience is (still) unknown but it contained several
Nokia employees who seemed to agree with us on the issue. From the press
we managed to get at least one important one, a reporter from STT which
is an agency that sells articles to many newspapers. This was
distributed to the audience in paper format:
