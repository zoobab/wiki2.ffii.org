## Observations

-   Earlier articles such as
    <http://www.itworld.com/Man/2687/030911eupatent/index.html> often
    extensively quote patent lobby propaganda statements, e.g. from [
    Arlene [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink")
    in 2003 (\"However, [ she](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink") says her
    critics haven\'t read her proposed amendments. In an interview
    Thursday, she said she is trying to move the directive in the
    direction her critics are seeking.\") without presenting the other
    side.
-   Meller insists on presenting FFII & Co as \"opensource\" or \"free
    software\" lobby groups
-   Meller reported critically about IPR Enforcement Directive mainly to
    the extent that such criticism came from the Nokia patent
    department.
-   Occasionally there are exceptions to this rule.
-   Mr Meller confided to an FFII lobbyist that Mr Mingorance owned a
    Macintosh (the \"proposal.doc\" which has circulated in 2002 before
    the official publication by the CEC was edited by Word v10, which
    only exists for Mac), and that he has maybe used this one to
    participate in the writing of the directive proposal.
