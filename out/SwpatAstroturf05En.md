*Around 20 multinational corporations with big patent departments and
big lobbying budgets entrusted numerous PR agencies and other lobbying
frontends to simulate support by small and medium enterprises and civil
society for software patents. 30-40 well-paid lobbyists roamed the
European Parliament up and down, left and right, every day. Due to
strong resistance of the misrepresented players, the deceptive means
employed in this campaign reached staggering proportions.*
