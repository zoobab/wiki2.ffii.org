Another article where a software company touts a patent on a great
\"technology\" without giving the number, let alone main claim, of the
concerned patent.

What is claimed is usually a calculation task, characterised by a
certain input and a certain output.

We still need to research what is claimed in this case.

Given the track record of patent hype publications in online media, we
can not even take the existence of the patent for granted. See

-   [ 2004-05-26 UK startup touts non-existent patent on \"mathematical
    solution\" for \"software design
    methodology\"](Verum040526En "wikilink")

for a recent example of false information uncritically spread on the
same online medium.

However, in this case there are indications that the patents do exist
and Telchemy is in fact active in the field of Voice over IP.

For a search of related Telchemy patents, the [EPO
database](http://ep.espacenet.com/ "wikilink") might be useful.

Internet Telephony is already heavily cluttered with patents, so that
writing software in this field has become particularly difficult, see

    no voice over
    IP\"](http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/voip/ "wikilink")
