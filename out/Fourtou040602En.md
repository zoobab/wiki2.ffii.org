From the latest [EDRI Newsletter](http://www.edri.org "wikilink")

The rapporteur of the EU Directive on the Enforcement of Intellectual
Property Rights, Janelly Fourtou (UDF, Conservative, France), has earned
millions from business related to Intellectual Property Rights, even
while she was shepherding the report through the European Parliament. As
several newspapers have investigated, Mrs. Fourtou runs a private fund
together with her husband, Jean-René Fourtou, who is the CEO of Vivendi
Universal, the media giant that is worldwide the biggest holder of
intellectual property rights. In November 2002, this fund acquired
transferable bonds worth 14,5 million Euro, which shall be transferred
into Vivendi Universal shares at preference conditions in 2005. The
Fourtou children have, according to the Financial Times, acquired bonds
for an additional 5 million Euro. The Fourtou couple has until now made
a computational surplus of 10 million Euro; their children 3,4 million
Euro.

Mr. and Mrs. Fourtou are under investigation in France because there are
allegations that the deal was made in contravention of rules against
insider trading and share price manipulation.

When she filled out the \"Declaration of financial interests\" every MEP
has to give, Mrs. Fourtou claimed she had \'nothing to declare\'. Now
the Green MEP Heide Ruehle complained with the President of the European
Parliament, Pat Cox, saying \"Mrs Fourtou should never have been
appointed rapporteur\". Any gains from their private fund, the Fourtous
say, shall be used for an artist exchange programme between France and
Morocco, where the couple has a house.

There is an EU corruption investigation Unit
[O.L.A.F](http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/olaf/ "wikilink") which can
investigate such conflicts of interest.

## FFII Comment {#ffii_comment}

The IPR Enforcement directive - intended to combat organized crime - was
passed on a rush to the EU Parliament this year. It could be very
dangerous when applied to our legal system. Its language infringes on
certain legal standards. The directive covers measures such as **Anton
Piller orders** (secret court authorisations of raids for evidence by
the plaintiff\'s agents \-- Article 8); **Mareva injunctions** (freezing
of assets, even before a case has been discussed in Court \-- Article
10.1); new powers to **demand the disclosure of very extensive
commercial and personal information** (Article 9); and the admissibility
of **denounciations by anonymous witnesses as court evidence** (Article
8.5). and Digital Rights Mangement.

FFII position to the directive see [FFII
UK](http://www.ffii.org.uk/ip_enforce/ipred.html "wikilink").
