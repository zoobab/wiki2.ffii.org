## Transcript

*Below, you can find a transcription/translation of the Polish
intervention and the Council meeting of 21 December 2004, in which they
removed the software patents directive from the list of A-items.*

### Chairman Mr Veerman: {#chairman_mr_veerman}

Point 16A: common position of the Council determined taking into account
the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council
concerning the patentability of in computers implemented inventions. And
B: I motivate that.

The common position that we will adopt in a moment has been debated
laboriously and for a long time during the preparatory activities in the
Council. The text in front of us is carefully balanced in the form of a
compromise on which the Council reached, with a qualified majority, an
agreement in May.

After the formal adoption today, the text will be sent to the European
Parliament. I am convinced we are all looking forward to the start of
the discussions in the EP, hoping that potential misunderstandings
between the Council and the EP can be cleared, and that the road to the
definite adoption of this important draft directive can be opened.

In document 16120/04 [ADD1](ADD1 "wikilink"), you can find the
declarations of the Commission, and of the Hungarian, Latvian and Dutch
delegations. The Council will approve the incorporation of these
declarations in the minutes.

I see that Poland wants to say something. Poland can speak.

### Wlodzimierz Marcinski {#wlodzimierz_marcinski}

*Poland\'s Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Science and
Information Technology:*

Thank You.

Chairman, Commissioner, High Council.

Poland is determined to opt for unambiguous expression in the law of the
European Union on issues connected with the patentability of
computer-implemented inventions, which at the same time must ascertain
that computer programs are excluded from patentability.

This position results from the fact that it is clearly noticeable that
the lack of order in such matters has resulted both in the difference in
practice in particular European Union countries, as well as in the
behaviour of the European Patent Office, which has issued many thousands
of patents for computer programs.

In the opinion of Poland, this process should not be continued at such a
scale.

Poland, having in mind the necessity of further research on the
directive project to strengthen legal certainty (\...) for enterprises
in area of research and development, does not deny its support for a
common position leading to second hearing.

Poland however pleads for withdrawal of the item concerning the project
of directive of European Parliament and the Council on Computer
Implemented Inventions from list of A-items of the agenda of this
Council meeting.

The Polish Government still needs more time for preparing and delivering
an appropriate statement to the Council regarding the matter this
directive is all about.

We think this statement will be balanced and constructive towards
working out a European compromise.

We think that some crucial items in the text of the project resulting
from the May 18th meeting of the Council are not in favour to the
well-being of small and medium size enterprises.

We support unambiguous legal instruments which shall guarantee that
computer-implemented inventions are patentable, but computer programs or
parts thereof shall certainly be unpatentable.

Thank You

### Chairman Mr Veerman: {#chairman_mr_veerman_1}

Yes, I understand the Polish intervention in such a way that it concerns
a request to take this point off the list, because Poland still desires
a few more specifications regarding certain points. I propose to honour
this request.

Yes? Then point 16 has been removed from the A-items list. The
Commissioner:

### Commissioner (Joe Borg?): {#commissioner_joe_borg}

Yes, Mr President, may I say that the Commission regrets the withdrawal
of this item from the agenda, as the Commission attaches great
importance to its own proposal, as well as the agreement on the common
position that was reached during the Competitiveness Council.

### Chairman Mr Veerman {#chairman_mr_veerman_2}

I propose to take note of the comment of the commission and I maintain
my proposal to remove point 16 from the agenda. Then this is hereby so
decided.
