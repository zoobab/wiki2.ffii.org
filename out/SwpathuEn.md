    (discussion mostly in Hungarian)

## Background

-   2004-09-23 Mr. Barandy, the Justice Minister stepped down; he
    appointed Mr. Ficsor when he took office.
-   Patent Office president Ficsor leads the government\'s advisory
    group on \"intellectual property\"
    -   -   Patent Office is responsible for formulating hungarian
            opinion on all \"Intellectual Property\" questions
        -   Ficsor group follows and defends [
            EPO](SwpatepoEn "wikilink") line
        -   IT ministry doesn\'t like the EPO/Council line
        -   Foreign ministry also influential, interested mostly in
            avoiding conflicts with other governments
        -   All or most of the representation of Hungary in the Council
            is done by Dr. Gottfried PÃ©ter
        -   At some international meetings, Hungarian diplomats show
            themselves critical of US+EU patent extremism that is being
            pushed on them and not good for their economy. The patent
            movement has a weaker basis than in UK and DE, but no
            shortage of ardent believers who preach that HU will
            eventually win the \"strong IP\" game if it takes the
            winner\'s approach now. Others want to avoid being seen as a
            developping country with \"lower IP standards\". Membership
            in EPO gives HU patent movement a sense of superiority in
            dealing with their government.
-   All Hungarian IT associations have issued statements against
    software patents
-   Free software very strong in HU, city of Szeged built its
    administration on it.
