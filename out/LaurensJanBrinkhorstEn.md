## News

-   2004-08-02 [ Brinkhorst reinterprets Parliament\'s vote, continues
    push for software patents](NlParl040802En "wikilink")

## Background

Mr. Brinkhorst is currently the dutch minister of Economic Affairs. He
is affiliated with the party D\'66 (Social Liberals). At the time of
this writing (2004-5-14) the main attention needs to be focused on him,
since he is the one who will be voting in the Council of Ministers on
behalf of the Netherlands on 2004-5-17.

In a letter he wrote to the dutch parliament on 2004-5-10, he declared
that he would be voting **in favor** of software patents. This is not
only a disappointment, but also somewhat of a surprise, because his
party D\'66 is generally **opposed** to software patents. The
minister\'s decision is based on input from his advisors in the
ministery. Hopefully, fellow party members will manage to persuade him
to reconsider his decision before the final vote.
