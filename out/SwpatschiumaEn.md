*Patent attorney and patent law scholar at the MPI, together with Nack
and Straus, argues that \"new technologies\" (usually citing some very
impressive ultra-advanced examples) are unprotected without software
patents, that patents should be available for anything that is at the
forefront of R&D, that the constitutional right to private property
extends to such things, and especially that art 27 TRIPS requires the
deletion of the computer programs exclusion from art 52 EPC, no matter
how that exclusion is interpreted. This is also called the \"autonomous
interpretation of TRIPS\", a theory which is tied to Schiuma\'s name.*
