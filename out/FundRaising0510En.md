*FFII has spent roughly 160k EUR during the campaign of the second
reading on the software patent directive, and is nearly running out of
cash right now for future projects (such as paying a lobbyist and
renting an office in Brussels, conference on
[IPRED2](IPRED2 "wikilink"), etc\...). A fund raising initiative needs
to be done.*
