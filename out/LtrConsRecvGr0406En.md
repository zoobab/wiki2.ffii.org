If you can help, please contact Antonios Christofides, anthony\@itia.ntua.gr. {#we_still_need_to_send_the_appeal_to_various_persons_in_the_ministry_to_the_head_of_the_parliament_to_the_party_leaders_and_others._if_you_can_help_please_contact_antonios_christofides_anthonyitia.ntua.gr.}

## Appeal delivered to Government {#appeal_delivered_to_government}

The letter was delivered by Antonios Christofides to the Minister\'s
office, in the morning of 20/7/2004. The document delivered can be found
at <http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf> (in Greek, of
course). It was delivered together with a short cover letter. The people
responsible for the incoming documents said the Minister, Mr. Sioufas,
reads all of them and assigns them to others; they advised to call after
a week in order to learn which person it will have been assigned to.

In the evening of that same day, a press release was issued by the Greek
team. The Greek version of it is at
<http://epatents.hellug.gr/pages/pr_2004-07-20/>. A quick-and-dirty
English translation follows.

Until now, the appeal has been delivered to:

### Minister of Development of Greece {#minister_of_development_of_greece}

` Minister of Development Mr. Sioufas`\
` Mesogion 119`\
` 10192 Athens`\
` Greece`

Delivered personally to Minister\'s Office, 20 Jul 2004, and got
reference number 4143/20-7-2004. Called on 2 September 2004 (the
Registry of the Minister\'s office phone number is +30-2106974722) and
were told that the document has been given to the General Secretariat of
Industry (Geniki Grammateia Biomichanias).

### Prime Minister of Greece {#prime_minister_of_greece}

` Prime Minister Mr. Konstantinos Karamanlis`\
` Megaro Maximou`\
` Irodou Attikou 19`\
` 10674 Athens`\
` Greece`

Posted on 23 Jul 2004. The main reason for sending to the PM was because
the cover letter of the Appeal sent to the Minister of Development said
we were CC\'ing the PM; we did this to give more weight, rather because
we think the PM office would pay any attention at all.

### Minister of Commerce of Cyprus {#minister_of_commerce_of_cyprus}

` Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Mr. Yiorgos Lillikas`\
` Andrea Araouzou 6`\
` 1421 Lefkosia`\
` Cyprus`

Posted on 1 Sep 2004. The cover letter, besides the Minister, also
mentions the Permanent Secretary, Sotiris Sotiriou, as intended
recipient.

## Greek Press Release, 20 Jul 2004, poorly translated {#greek_press_release_20_jul_2004_poorly_translated}

A document delivered today by FFII representatives to the Minister of
Development, Mr Sioufas, makes disclosures about deceit of the Ministers
of the EU. The document, an appeal signed by companies and
organizations, available from
<http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/urgent-appeal.pdf>, provides specific
evidence of deceit and surprise tactics used to fool the ministerial
officials during the Council meeting of 18 May 2004 concerning the
infamous software patent directive.

Attempts by European patent offices and large multinational corporations
to legalise software patents, despite being forbidden by Article 52 of
the European Patent Convention, have been going on for years, but have
met strong resistance. Even the Commission, who had proposed to legalise
software patents two years ago, today claim to be against software
patents, as Commissioner Bolkestein said during the Council meeting of
18 May. The economic studies and the experience from USA and Japan,
where software patents are allowed, clearly indicate catastrophic
consequences in innovation and in the economic development of the
information-based society; as a result, Europe is unanimously opposed to
software patents. Nevertheless, the text adopted by the Council ensures
the opposite of what the European Parliament, the Ministers and the
Commission claim they want. This is achieved by means of vague points,
contradictions, and clever devices of the form \"software is not
patentable, unless [condition that after close scrutiny proves to always
be true](complex "wikilink")\".

The delivery of the appeal to the Minister came soon after a
demonstration that had been organised by the Greek team against software
patents last Friday at Stournara street, Athens. More than a hundred
persons participated, leaflets were distributed, banners and ballons
were used to inform passers-by, while the details about the delivery of
the appeal were discussed. Photographs from the demonstration are
available at <http://epatents.hellug.gr/box/st04photos/>.

The appeal, which will soon be delivered to the other ministers of the
EU, asks to revoke the decision of 18 May, something that is possible
because the decision is merely a political agreement, and the final
adoption is scheduled for the next Council meeting expected in September
2004. The Dutch Parliament had also issued a similar demand on 1 July
(see older press release mentioned in the references).

Dimitris Glezos, FFII representative in Greece, comments: \"It is
important to study the events of 18 May deeply so that similar
catastrophes are avoided in the future. The software patent issue
concerns many people who closely monitor the news, and who naturally
learned what happened at the Council meeting.\" Concerning the Greek
representatives he commented that \"it is up to our representatives to
prove that they decide what they vote and not others, even more so for
such an important issue as software patents.\"
