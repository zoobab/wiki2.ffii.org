# Strong Show of Opposition against Software Patents and Support for European Parliament {#strong_show_of_opposition_against_software_patents_and_support_for_european_parliament}

Wednesday April 14, hundreds of yellow t-shirts with the slogan \"No
Software Patents\" and \"Power to the Parliament\" illuminated the blue
sky of Brussels. Wearing the same colors, 7-800 demonstrators from 25
European countries\[1\] marched from the European Parliament to the
Commission and Council and back. In front of the Council building,
pantomimes were performed and 500 balloons were released.\[2\].

The demonstration was followed by a conference in the European
Parliament in an overcrowded auditorium (> 250 persons).

The amendments voted in September by the elected legislators are today
completely ignored by the [ Council\'s Patent Policy Working
Party](SwpatconsiliumEn "wikilink") and by the [ European Commission\'s
Directorate for the Internal Market](SwpatcecEn "wikilink"), both of
whom are evading all discussion and hiding behind the [ European Patent
Office](SwpatepoEn "wikilink"). The speeches of [ David
Ellard](DavidEllardEn "wikilink"), in charge of the dossier at the
European Commission, and of [ David Sant](DavidSantEn "wikilink") from
the European Patent Office particularly illustrated this unwillingness
to take any concerns into account.

Note the continuation of this second round with conferences in
[Slovenia](http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/ljub04/ "wikilink") and
Poland these next weeks, then opinion-building work at the time of the
elections of the European Parliament in June, and during the next
reading of this directive in Parliament, expected for this autumn.
