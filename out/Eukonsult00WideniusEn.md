here is a working URL to Widenius contribution:

<http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/widenius.pdf>

note: [FfiiKonsultEn](FfiiKonsultEn "wikilink")

and it is probably better worded
[Widenius00xxxxEn](Widenius00xxxxEn "wikilink") where a link is given to
the consultation mentioned and a information page about Widenius:
[MichaelWideniusEn](MichaelWideniusEn "wikilink")

The first note above was added to the addenda page of
<http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eukonsult00/widenius/index.en.html> (which
is this page) where the links to Widenius submission to the hearing are
broken. The correct fix would have been to correct the broken
[URLs](URLs "wikilink"), not making a new kwiki-structure.
