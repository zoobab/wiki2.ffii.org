## Press Release {#press_release}

Munich, 07/30/2004 - When the city administration of Munich decided to
migrate its IT infrastructure to the Linux operating system, it made
headline news around the world. That project is now threatened by
software patents. In May the EU Council and Commission have reached
\"political agreement\" to legalise software patents and reject all
limits of patentability for which the European Parliament had voted in
September 2003.

Software patents are considered the greatest danger to the usage and
development of Linux and other Free Software. A cursory search by FFII
revealed that the Linux \"base client\", which the city of Munich plans
to install on the desktop computers of approximately 14,000 employees,
is in conflict with more than 50 European software patents.

Today Jens Muehlhaus, an alderman from the Green Party, filed two
motions in which he calls on the mayor of Munich, the Social Democrat
Christian Ude, to contact the federal government of Germany on this
matter and to analyse how the EU software patent directive affects
Munich\'s Linux project. The politician, a supporter of free source,
warns that patent infringement assertions could take entire departments
of the city administration out of operation. He attached the
[preliminary result of an FFII patent

(contains link to [the actual PDF patents which are considered
infringed](http://www.presseportal.de/showbin.htx?id=31139&type=document&action=download&attname=Anhang.pdf "wikilink"))
to his motions. Mr. Muehlhaus expresses concern over the future ability
of free source software to meet the needs of the city administration if
software patents massively hinder its development. Related caveats have
been voiced by the SME association CEA-PME and by Deutsche Bank
Research.

A week earlier, the chief information officer of Munich, Wilhelm
Hoegner, said it is \"indispensable\" to check on the consequences of
the software patent directive to free source software. Any such
oversight would be a \"catastrophe for Munich\'s Linux migration
project, and for open source in general\".

Florian Mueller, an active participant in the software patent debate,
sees the EU Council on the wrong track: \"Open source is a historic
opportunity for Europe to save costs and create jobs. Schroeder, Blair
and Chirac should demonstrate leadership and stop their civil servants
from sacrificing the open source opportunity to the insatiable patent
bureaucracy, lest some large corporations will shut down open source and
many [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink").\" Mr. Mueller is a software entrepreneur,
and an adviser to [ MySQL](MysqlEn "wikilink"), one of Europe\'s largest
free source software companies.
