\"Lexra produces MIPS-compatible microprocessor cores but does not hold
a license from MIPS. Lexra\'s main contention in its defense is that it
uses software to emulate MIPS core functions without actually using the
full MIPS instruction set. MIPS filed suit against Lexra in October
1999, claiming Lexra\'s design infringed upon its intellectual
property.\"
