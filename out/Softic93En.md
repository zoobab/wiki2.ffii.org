Prof. Tamai quotes a set of patent claims from the SOFTIC symposium of
1993, where patent officials from JP, US and EU judged the patentability
of an example algorithm at different levels of concretisation. The
European representative was more willing than his colleagues from US and
JP to grant patents on abstract claims.
