## Overview

EICTA published an English translation of an article originally
[published in
Dutch](http://www.openmagazine.nl/node/view/124 "wikilink") by
[OpenMagazine](http://www.openmagazine.nl "wikilink").

The only trace left [is a Google cache of a page with a (non-working)
link](http://www.google.de/search?q=cache:NCGTn0HBn4EJ:www.patents4innovation.org/+brinkhorst+computer+programs+patentable+europe&hl=de&client=firefox-a "wikilink")
to that page.

!OpenMagazine is published under [this Creative Commons
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/ "wikilink"),
which

-   requires attribution (none is given in the EICTA article)
-   forbids derivative works (a translation is a derivative work
    according to the license)
-   requires the license terms of the text to be made known to readers
    (this is not done on the EICTA site)
-   forbids commercial use (as patents4innovation is a corporate
    lobbying site, this part of the license could be infringed as well)

We have confirmed with an editor of !OpenMagazine that EICTA did not ask
for permission to be relieved of any of these requirements.
Additionally, the same issue of !OpenMagazine also published a
[reaction](http://www.openmagazine.nl/node/view/125 "wikilink") (in
Dutch) by [ Reinier Bakels](ReinierBakelsEn "wikilink"), in which he,
among others, corrected some factual errors in Brinkhorst\'s text. None
of those corrections are mentioned or referred to by EICTA either.

## Comments

### Jonas Maebe {#jonas_maebe}

It is strange that an organisation which claims to be very much in
favour of strong intellectual property protection, acts entirely
disrespectful as far as other people\'s intellectual achievements are
concerned. Maybe the reason they lobby so heavily for software patents
and claim that copyright cannot protect anything, stems from the fact
that they simply do not understand that copyright covers much more than
literal copies. This incident perfectly illustrates how \"rewriting a
copyrighted work into something different that still means the same\" is
still an act of copyright infringement.
