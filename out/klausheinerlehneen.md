*Klaus-Heiner Lehne is a lawyer from Germany and Member of the European
Parliament (MEP), elected with the Christian Democrats (CDU) which is
part of the European People\'s Party (EPP). Lehne has been energetically
pushing for unlimited patentability of software and has an active role
as the coordinator of the EPP\'s parliamentary group in the European
Parliament\'s Legal Affairs Committee (JURI).*

*Already being an MEP, Lehne joined the law firm Taylor Wessing in 2003
as a partner and became the head of the \"regulatory affairs\"
department, whose job is to advise corporate customers about future
directions of EU legislation. In other words, besides his active and
public function as MEP, he is hired by corporate interests.*

*Another leading member of his department is Andreas Haak, who seems to
have retained his accreditation as Lehne\'s assistant for a while even
after assuming the new post in the office with Lehne.*

*The bulk of Taylor Wessing\'s business appears to be in patent
litigation for large companies. Taylor Wessing has special business
relations with patent lobby organisations, offering their members
reductions in fees. Parts of Lehne\'s speeches and amendments come
directly from Siemens and UNICE. Siemens\' lobbyists are well-known
guests in Lehne\'s office while representatives of SME in Lehne\'s home
region have been complaining about inability to receive any
appointments. Lehne has for a long time been responsible for
transparency rules in the European Parliament.*

## Law firm Taylor Wessing in heavy business with patent lobby in Europe\'s busiest place for patent disputes {#law_firm_taylor_wessing_in_heavy_business_with_patent_lobby_in_europes_busiest_place_for_patent_disputes}

During the [ EPP hearing on June, 2nd,
2005](EppHearing050602En "wikilink"), Lehne gave the final speech, being
the EPP coodinator in JURI. He claimed that [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") from
his D√ºsseldorf constituency needed software patents and felt not
represented by UEAPME. However, FFII knows of several
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") from that region which are against software
patents and tried repeatedly to meet Lehne. He rejected all requests
while having several meetings with representatives of Siemens.

D√ºsseldorf is Germany\'s (and therefore Europe\'s) main location for
patent litigation. The courts are popular in circles of patent owners
due to their relative efficiency in patent enforcement. One beneficiary
of this is the law firm Taylor & Wessing. In their D√ºsseldorf and
Brussels agency, Lehne is partner and head of the \"Regulatory Affairs\"
division (strategic consultancy for clients who want to know details
about future directions of legislation \-- presumably these clients want
to know such details in order to take influence).

Taylor Wessing offers a 10% discount on their services for members of [
BVDW](SwpatdmmvDe "wikilink") (= DMMV + VSI). The BVDW acts in Brussels
as one of Microsoft\'s main lobbyists. The German Multimedia Association
(DMMV) keeps the interest of its members by, among other things, price
reductions such as that of Taylor Wessing, while he lobbies for
positions that have nothing to do with the wishes of DMMV\'s members and
instead regularly align themselves with current Microsoft campaigns.

## Lobbying of Taylor Wessing {#lobbying_of_taylor_wessing}

Taylow Wessing attends large companies in patent business and offers
further services specially tailored for those customers. Among them is
\"strategic consultancy\" about Brussel\'s legislation. This
\"Regulatory Affairs\" division is headed by Lehne. The guaranteed
confidentiality protection for talks between lawyer and client makes it
rather simple to cloud mix-ups between public and private interest.

In a [document from

It might be interesting that Taylor & Wessing talks directly about the
\"protection of software\" when it comes to the EU directive, something
that, according to Lehne, shouldn\'t become patentable at all.

The department of \"Regulatory Affairs\" assists lobby activities aiming
at European institutions. This department was founded on October 1st,
2003. It was staffed with Lehne and his \"scientific advisor\" Andreas
Haak. Wolgang Rehman, the German managing partner of Taylor-Wessing,
describes <http://de.taylorwessing.com/de/n_aktuell_det.asp?UID=49> the
tasks of RA as:

\|\| It is our task to install an early-warning systen for our clients
that allows for strategic advice in the preposition of legislative acts.
In our experience, clients have a great interest in learning about
possible impacts of legislation as early as possible \|\|

See the [german
original](http://de.taylorwessing.com/de/n_aktuell_det.asp?UID=49 "wikilink")
and a [local
copy](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/khlehne/twuid49.html "wikilink").

Further down in this document we find:

\|In close cooperation with groups within Taylor-Wessing that are
specialised on specific market sectors, regulatory affairs will inform
anticipatory about regulation questions and show possible activities to
their clients.\|

What Taylor-Wessing sees as \"possible activities\" is explained in a
[brochure](http://www.taylorwessing.com/publications/2004/regulatory_affairs_27-02-04.pdf "wikilink")
as:

\|\... businesses need not and should not play an entirely passive role.
Regulatory impact assessments of proposed EU law are currently
relatively unsophisticated, largely due to a lack of understanding of
business realities on the part of the EU legislators. Against this,
legislators are generally willing to listen to the views of those most
affected by their proposals, provided that they are offered
constructively and appropriately. In many cases, the EU institutions
rely on the responses to formal consultations on proposed legislation.\|

Instead of simple observation we here see targeted influencing of
legislative processes by groups of interest. Especially mentioned are
\"formal consultations\" - hearings within EU institutions, organised by
commissions and political parties. Taylor-Wessing also \"helps\" in
convincing institutions of clients positions:

\|Effective representation of the views businesses therefore requires
not only thorough understanding of the way which the institutions
operate, but also a feel for the arguments that are likely to influence
them most effectively and how, when and where to present them.\|

The fact that Taylor-Wessing offers close relations to institutions of
the EU is not surpsrising, seeing the fact that Partners of
Taylor-Wessing have been or still are working in these institutions:

\|We maintain close contacts with the EU and national institutions,
enabling us to provide an early warning of significant legislative
proposals and other important measures and developments. We can help
businesses not only to adapt to change, but also to minimise its effect.
We advise on how to put a halt to ill thought-out proposals and
over-burdensome regulation. We provide focused, commercial and
cost-effective advice that can make a significant difference to the
bottom line.\|

Self-description of their \"services\":

\|Effective representation of interests We have considerable experience
of coordinating successful campaigns to influence the regulatory process
(\...) - Unrivalled contacts: Members of our team have first-hand
experience of the legislative process. Taylor Wessing has historically
had strong links with the field of politics, in France, the UK and
Germany. Members of the team have worked in government departments,
regulators and other institutions.\| Mr. Lehne can certainly be seen as
a part of this

Some references that show how Taylor Wessing was able to \"help\" their
clients:

\|Advising a German manufacturing company on the impact of the proposed
EU Takeover Directive - Initially in the context of a dispute concerning
an alleged abuse of dominance, helping a client to promote amendments to

## Andreas Haak: Contact person for \"Regulatory Affairs\" and assistant to Lehne {#andreas_haak_contact_person_for_regulatory_affairs_and_assistant_to_lehne}

According to the [Regulary Affairs
brochure](http://www.taylorwessing.com/publications/2004/regulatory_affairs_27-02-04.pdf "wikilink"),
the contact person for the whole division, which comprises 8 employees,
is Andreas Haak (see last page):

\|For further information, please contact: Andreas Haak in Brussels or
D√ºsseldorf, any of the partners named in this brochure, or any of the
partners with whom you usually deal.\|

Although Lehne is member of this division according to a press release,
he is, in contrast to Haak, who joined the law firm at the same time,
not listed in the brochure.

Andreas Haak, called \"scientific counsel\" of Lehne in the press
release, was until July 2005 listed among the [European Parliamant\'s
accredited
assistants](http://www2.europarl.eu.int/assistants/assist.jsp?lng=de&sort=bymemb&index=L "wikilink").
Accordingly, Haak would have had privileged access to EU institutions
and to internal details of various legislative processes. This issue was
raised in July 2005, and soon thereafter the entry of Haak in the public
database was deleted. According to oral sources in the EP, this was
however an error. They say that Haak was no longer an assistant after
the [ Parliamentary elections of June 2004](ElectResu0406En "wikilink").
This explanation is corroborated by the fact that Haak was not listed as
assistant on the pages of the Christian Democaratic Union (CDU) in
Northrhine-Westphalia:

From [the Sep. 15th, 2003 press release by Taylor-Wessing about
Lehne/Haak](http://de.taylorwessing.com/de/n_aktuell_det.asp?UID=49 "wikilink")
(here the [version dated Oct
3rdhttp://www.taylorwessing.com/cgi-bin/pressrelease.cgi?num=604](English "wikilink"))
we learn, that Haak must have worked as \"scientific counsel to the
coordinator in the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament\"
before 2003:

\|With him (Lehne) Andreas Max Haak strengthens the Regulatory Affairs
division at Taylor Wessing. Mr. Haak is lawyer and since several years
scientific counsel to the coordinator of the Legal Affairs Committee of
the European Parliament. In addition he possesses experience as a
counsel on European law.\|

Lehne is not \"coordinator of the Legal Affairs Committee\" but
coordinator of the EPP in this committee. Therefore, Haak was not
subordinate to the institution \"Coordinator\...\" but to Lehne
personally. [Another
source](http://www.wtis.de/cgi-bin/vst/tm.cgi?benutzer=struktur "wikilink")
mentions, that Andreas Max Haak talked on Sep, 26th 2003 as \"scientific
assistant of Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, MEP\".

## Taylor Wessing statements about the software patent directive {#taylor_wessing_statements_about_the_software_patent_directive}

As known from [Taylor Wessing\'s brochure of
2005](http://www.taylorwessing.com/publications/2005/patents.pdf "wikilink"),
the software patent directive is one of the dossiers for which the
Regulatory Affairs department of Taylor Wessing is offering its lobbying
services in Brussels. Concerning the possible directions of this
lobbying, some hints can be found in statements of Taylor Wessing
employees.

Nigel Stoate, a patent attorney with London firm Taylor Wessing
[comments](http://www.smh.com.au/news/next/patently-absurd/2005/07/04/1120329359129.html?oneclick=true "wikilink")

\|\"Europe recognises that patenting software is important to keep up
with the US, and the new directive achieves this. The new directive is
intended to harmonise the position across all the member states.\"\|

Stoate correctly presents the purposes and effects of the proposed
directive. This is however contradicted by his partner Lehne in the [
plenary debate of July 5th](Lehne050705En "wikilink"): \"Nobody, nobody,
no political group \-- for individuals I can not exclude it \-- wants
software patents. That is not at all the subject of discussion. The
purpose of this directive was to \_\_not\_\_ let the US development
happen in Europe and to prevent it. That is the purpose. And the Common
Position too fulfills this purpose.\"

Christopher Thornham of Taylor Wessing
[comments](http://www.cpaglobal.com/website/cpaglobal.nsf/content/newsletterissue/File/IPR9.Pdf "wikilink")
the discussion about the directive in patentees\' journal IP Review (p.
18) as follows:

\|\"The Open Source movement has tried to derail the whole concept of
the Directive. In my view their fears are unfounded. Patent protection
won\'t stop people from innovating. In the US patents are easily
available but that is not stopping innovation. In fact, it s the
opposite. The proposed Directive \-- as an attempt to harmonise patent
law in Europe in the field of software \-- is better than having a
situation in which laws differ country by country.\"\|

It\'s wrong to say that patent laws differ from country to country. The
European Patent Convention was implemented in national legislation in
1978, and has been uniformly in force in all EU countries since then.
Being a professional lawyer, Thornham surely knows this. Likewise, it is
wrong to attribute the results of the 1st reading to an \"open source
movement\".

Both fallacies are regular parts of the rhetoric repertoire of the
patent lobby, including Lehne.
