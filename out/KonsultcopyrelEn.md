# 2004-10-31 Consultation on the review of EU legislation on copyright and related rights, {#consultation_on_the_review_of_eu_legislation_on_copyright_and_related_rights}

## early draft for submission {#early_draft_for_submission}

1\. Commercial use and access of public data

Many public agencies provide free accessible databases. The legal right
for alternative commercial services to use such public data.

For example, German Job search engines, Commercial or non-commercial
webservices currently may not access the job database of the German
Federal Agency for Employment. Similarly, the German Bundesamt für
Statistik copyrights its collected data.

Freeing up of information in public databases is crucial to enable
competition in our single market. Public databases often rely on
inefficient access tools provided by Goverment agencies that run them.
These tools often become bottlenecks, and provide little
interoperability. Reuse of such data sources for commercial and
non-commercial purposes shall not be restricted. Discrimination against
private access to public data does not serve competition in the internal
market.

2\. Use of open standards by public agencies

To enable easy access of public data usage of Open Standards shall be
promoted. Open Standards enable interoperability.

3\. Undermining copyright by patents

\"Also, in a situation where the right holder can rely upon both the
copyright and sui generis right protection, it would seem inconsistent
that a statutory exception regarding the copyright protection could be
undermined by a claim based on the sui generis protection.\"

In particular, Software patents often undermine copyright of software
products. Conflicts between different field of IP legislation should be
further analysed.

4\. Software as a field of technology?

\"However, it should be noted that such a definition [computer
programs](of "wikilink") might not keep up with the pace of technology
and would risk excluding new, presently unknown types of computer
programs from the scope of protection.\"

Data Processing and Computer programs do not belong to a field of
\'technology\'. Furthermore, they are no different from literary works.
This means that special regulation is not needed.

It is currently difficult to make a destinction between different kind
of works and to decide what legislation applies. For example, is an
eBook a Book, data or part of a program? Similarly, is the introduction
sequence in computer game part of the computer program or a film. This
ambiguity means that special treatment for computer software as
\"technology\" is not only unreasonable but unworkable.

5\. Right of communication to the public

Esp. the draft EU-Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented
inventions could restrict the freedom of publication. see:

6\. Promote Interoperability

\"2.2.1.3. Decompilation The objective of Article 6 on decompilation is
to ensure the ability of two or more computer hardware devices or
software components to connect, exchange information and work together,
including those of different manufacturers.\"

This is needed to ensure interoperability. 2.2.1.3 shall be named
\"Interoperability\"

\"However, more recently it has been argued that the scope for
decompilation is in practice too limited and does not sufficiently meet
the objectives of the provision and, in particular, the current market
demands. On the other hand, as yet there is no jurisprudence to support
these claims; nor is there any other evidence to suggest that there
would be a need for revision.\"

Jurisprudence lack competence to set law. So it is irrelevant for a
law-making process.

7\. Protection of technological measures

Consider problems of archiving and forensic data recovery. Technological
changes could mean that data protected by such protection devices become
inaccessible as the original device becomes obslete. For the
preservation of our digital heritage this is crucial.

The protection has further unintended consequences when it may be used
by rights-holders to gain control over legitimately purchased media and
content over and above that granted by copyright law. This leads to
distortions in the market against the interests of consumers, developers
and [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"). One example relates to the region locks and
encryption mechanisms on [DVDs](DVDs "wikilink") and computer games.

Protection of technological measures should apply only to the extent
that they protect against actual copyright infringement. The protection
should be forfeited where it is being misused, for example to prevent
legitimate competition and trade. European copyright law should define
positive fair-dealing rights, including rights such as private backup,
time-shifting and space-shifting, which cannot be over-ridden by
contract or technology.

8\. Duration of copyright protection

\"The term of protection for authors rights was set to run until 70
years after the death of the author, and the term of protection for
related rights until 50 years after the event which triggers the term
running (such as the date of the performance). There has been a call
from certain circles to extend the term of protection of related rights
and align it to that of an author since performances are claimed to
provide a similar element of creativity. There has also been a specific
concern expressed when the performer is also the author of the music as
this results in the same persons performance falling into the public
domain before the work itself.\"

Please consider the prolongation lock-in. To provide an incentive the
duration has to be adjusted to the economically relevant period of time.
On the the one hand 70 years are already economically irrelevant to
provide an incentive for businesses, on the other hand creative
derivative works face high transaction cost with a too long period of
protection. Public domain creates a lot of opportunities for businesses
to make profit from recycling old works.

\"Moreover, in view of the recent changes to the term of protection
under the US Copyright Act, it has been argued by some stakeholders that
it would be advisable to align the term of protection of phonogram
producers in the Community with the new, extended protection of 95 years
from the year of first publication for sound recordings in the USA.
Otherwise, according to the proponents of change, European music
producers and music industry might be at a disadvantage as compared to
their US equivalents.\"

Again: 95 years is not the period which is relevant for business
decisions today. In many dynamic industries such as the software
business 15 year old software is a matter of history. Furthermore
litigation action by failed companies who exploit their old rights
portfolio may be seen as a serious treath to competition. See the SCO
vs. IBM case in 2003, Sco claimed to own UNIX based on 30 year old code.

We don\'t see a reason why a prolongation ex-post would provide any
incentive for businesses as only historic works are covered that are
already there. So only the rightholders would benefit. Furthermore the
trust in legislation is undermined when expiration dates are extended
again and again.

There is no good reason to assume that the Euiropean system may cause a
disadvantage.

9\. Preserving of intangible digital heritage

\"2.2.4.2. Exception for the benefit of libraries\" Make sure that
Digital Rights Management devices and the legal provisions of protection
thereof will no render this stated goal useless as nobody may access the
works anymore locked down in forgotten proprietary formats.

10\. \"3.2 Ownership\"

\"From the point of view of the functioning of the Internal Market,
perhaps the most significant uncertainty regarding the ownership of
rights in cross-border situations arises from differences in rules on
the ownership of works created in the course of employment.\" Ownership
can be shifted over time. It est rights given on the basis of a work
contract will expire earlier and be granted back to the author who
enjoys them for the rest of time.

11\. Interoperability

Interoperability exceptions in legislation are not enough. In oder to
enable Free Competition in the internal market interoperability has to
be actively enforced. Esp. public organisations shall be commited
towards the usage of Open Standards to ensure interoperability of data.
There is still no harmonisation of positive interoperability
enforcement.

12\. Rights of Authors

Authors shall enjoy the right to lessen the scope and duration of the
protection covering their works. FFII affirms the teaching of author\'s
rights according to the Berne Convention and rejects the Anglo-Saxon
teaching of \'copy right\'.

13\. Free Software act

Given the importance of Free and Open Source Software for the Internet
Infrastructure (91 per cent of .de-Websites run Open Source Apache
Webserver etc.) legal certainty for the various licenses has to be
explicitely approved in order to reduce market insecurity. All of then
rely on copyright and many of them are accepted by common use. However,
given the fact that many of them were written under US law it was
doubted they were valid. Creation of national tailored free software
licenses failed as they were not able to interoperate with international
standard licenses and thus not adopted. Lawyers approved validity of
many free software licences, but only a free software act can sent a
clear message to the European market and reduce market insecurity.
