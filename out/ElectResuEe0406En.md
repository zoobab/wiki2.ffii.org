The situation with 6 Estonian seats is as follows (EP parliamentary
groups in parentheses):

-   [Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik
    Erakond](http://www.sotsdem.ee "wikilink") 3 (PSE) and
    [Isamaliit](http://www.isamaaliit.ee "wikilink") 1 (EPP-ED) \-- both
    have repeatedly shown their will to stand against software patents,
    ESD\'s standard response is also to suggest reading Larry Lessig\'s
    [Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc "wikilink") and Isamaliit
    even slightly used software patentability issue during last weeks to
    gain press visibility

-   [Reformierakond](http://www.reform.ee "wikilink") 1 (ELDR) \--
    minister Meelist Atonen chose to believe that \"irish compromise\"
    is already protecting us from software patents when he represented
    Estonia on 18.05.2004 meeting.

-   [Keskerakond](http://www.keskerakond.ee "wikilink") 1 (ELDR) \--
    despite repeated requests has failed to define their position

There is an ongoing process to help Reformierakond understand the
difference between current draft and the amendments made by EP.
