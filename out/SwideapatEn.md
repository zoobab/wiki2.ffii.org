# \"Software idea patents\" {#software_idea_patents}

\--\> \[ [ ePatents](EpatentsEn "wikilink") \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduced as a term by [ Richard Stallman](SwpatrmsEn "wikilink"). RMS
exlains his motivation as follows (mailing list discussion on
2004-10-26):

` "So when they hear the term "software patents", they get the wrong`\
` meaning. Many discussions of this issue in the media make it sound`\
` like the issue is patenting of specific programs, and that particular`\
` mistake is crucial in why many people expect software patents to be`\
` beneficial for software developers."`

[ Hartmut Pilch](HartmutPilchEn "wikilink") disagreed:

By saying

`   "software idea patents"`

you also convey misunderstandings, such as

-   there are \"software xxx patents\" (e.g. \"software implementation
    patents\"), which might be OK
-   software [such](as "wikilink") is not being patented, only software
    ideas. Therefore the European Patent Convention has not been
    violated.
-   the term \"software patent\" is inaccurate, even RMS agrees. A term
    like [\"computer-implemented
    inventions\"](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/kinv/ "wikilink")
    is called for.

Our approach to this has been to make people understand what patents
are, what claims are, how patents and software interact, see

`   `[`http://swpat.ffii.org/news/intro/`](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/intro/)

On the other hand, if we want to package the important message into a
name, there are alternatives such as

-   idea monopolies
-   logic patents
-   computing patents
-   data processing patents
-   information patents
-   patents on computing rules and business processes
-   rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of
    general-purpose computing equipment
-   \...

which can be used in addition to the term \"software patents\". They
help people overcome a misunderstanding for which the term \"software
patent\" is not to blame. And they maintain this term in its prominent
position in the current debate. The patent movement has tried hard to
displace the term \"software patents\" and establish
\"computer-implemented invention\" instead. They have failed, and the
attempt has backfired on them. Why should we now come to their rescue?
