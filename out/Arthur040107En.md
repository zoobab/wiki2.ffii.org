The british daily newspaper \"The Independent\" has an article by
Charles Arthur titled \"The patenting of software is a complete mess and
discourages innovation\". The article explains the reasoning that leads
to software patents and points to the abstract nature of software
innovation as one of the reasons why the results are unsatisfactory. The
article mentions the European Patent Office\'s handling of the Amazon
patent but not the september vote of the European Parliament.
