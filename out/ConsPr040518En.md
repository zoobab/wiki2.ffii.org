# 2004-05-19 EU Council of Ministers reverses Parliament amendments to software patents directive {#eu_council_of_ministers_reverses_parliament_amendments_to_software_patents_directive}

## DRAFT - DO NOT RELEASE {#draft___do_not_release}

Yesterday in Brussels the Council of Ministers of the European Union
debated a proposal on the patentability of software, which had provoked
considerable controversy when it had been presented for its first
reading at the European Parliament, because of its potential collision
with copyright law and because of its potentially harmful effects on the
economic health of european software business and on the information
society in general.

After 45 minutes of debate, 10 minutes of non-public negotiations, and
13 minutes of summary, the Council voted to approve a text proposed by
the Irish Presidency, with a few meaningless amendments. The text, seen
by campaigners as uncompromisingly pro-patent, puts the Council in clear
confrontation with the view of the Directive adopted by the European
Parliament. The Council proposal not only removes all of the clarifying
and limiting amendments from the Parliament, but also adds new features
such as \'program claims\', which openly contradict the
non-patentability of software laid down in article 52 of the European
Patent Convention.

Several days earlier, the German government had promised to oppose the
Irish proposal or at least to abstain. It had built itself as the leader
of the opposition against the Irish text. However, a \"compromise\"
proposed by the Commission was apparently enough to bring round the
German delegation, which was followed by Poland and Latvia. Although
apparently enough to convince ministers, the amendments have only
cosmetic effects, and the text remains as uncompromisingly pro-patent as
the original Irish draft.

Commissioner Frits Bolkestein insisted during the debate that \"software
as such\" would be excluded by the Irish proposal. At the same time, it
becomes however possible to patent \"software executed by a computer\"
under most circumstances, which amounts to the same thing in practice.
At the press conference later that day, Bolkestein could not provide any
example of a software patent that would be excluded based on the text
that had been approved.

Florian Mueller, adviser to the CEO of !MySQL AB, views the decision
with concern: \"The directive proposed by the EU Council would
effectively make software patentable. I have seen enough examples of
software algorithms which were deemed by patent examiners to have
\`technical effect\' and thus be patentable. We strongly hope that this
legislative process will take a positive turn in its subsequent stage
and spare our industry the anti-competitive implications of software
patents.\"

The Council is now expected to officially adopt the text without
discussion in a later meeting. After that, the proposal faces a second
reading in the European Parliament this autumn. The newly elected
Parliament may insist on reinstating the limiting amendments which it
added at the Directive\'s first reading, and which were rejected by the
Council today. But at second reading this is only possible by absolute
majority of all the elected !MEPs \-- in practice a 2:1 or 3:1 vote of
!MEPs actually present.

If the Parliament does not sustain its amendments, the Directive will
confirm the legality of patents on computerised methods in Europe,
including business methods such as the Amazon gift ordering patent.
