The [Protocol on the Role of National Parliaments in the European
Union](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/treaties/selected/livre305.html "wikilink")
encourages participation of national parliaments in the EU Council\'s
decision process. There is even a joint committee of European Affairs
committees of the national parliaments (COSAC) which occasionally
convenes.

It is well known that the Council\'s [ \"political agreement\" on
software patents](Cons040518En "wikilink") was achieved mostly without
any input from national parliaments or against such input. Given that
the Council [completely undid the work of the
Parliament](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/tabl04/ "wikilink"),
this Council decision is in special need of legitimation by national
parliaments. There is still a chance.

The protocol encourages parliaments to express their views after the
translations are ready

[Rules of
procedure](http://ue.eu.int/uedocs/cms_data/docs/2004/6/21/Councils%20rules%20of%20procedure.pdf "wikilink")
of the Council, article 3.3:

` "Items relating to the adoption of an act or a common position on a legislative `\
` proposal or a proposal for a measure to be adopted in accordance with Title VI `\
` of the Treaty on European Union shall not be placed on the provisional agenda `\
` for a decision until the six-week period provided for in point 3 of the`\
` Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union has elapsed.`

` The Council may unanimously derogate from the six-week period where the entry `\
` of an item is subject to the exception on grounds of urgency provided for in `\
` point 3 of that Protocol."`

From the
[protocol](http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/treaties/selected/livre305.html "wikilink"):

` DESIRING, however, to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in `\
` the activities of the European Union and to enhance their ability to express `\
` their views on matters which may be of particular interest to them,`

The protocol explicitely gives national parliaments the right to read
the texts in their own languages, and then express their views. The
protocol is part of the treaty of Amsterdam, but almost nobody seems to
know it, Tell your parliaments, they will be glad to hear. Especially
since the Union became so much bigger, the protocol is essential in
partly solving the democratic deficit.

Best of all, there is a clear case to use the protocol! The software
patent directive. Use this directive to make Europe more democratic.

## COSAC

<http://www.europa-web.de/europa/03euinf/10counc/cosacnat.htm> :

Democracy in the EU should be strengthened, believes Mr Claus
Larsen-Jensen, Chairman of the Folketing\'s (Danish Parliament) European
Affairs Committee and Chairman of COSAC - an assembly of the national
parliaments of the EU Member States - during the Danish EU Presidency.
He has, therefore, presented a number of proposals designed to reform
COSAC and its role in European politics. Representatives of the European
Affairs Committees in the national parliaments of the Member States will
meet with their colleagues from the candidate countries and with
representatives of the European Parliament on 17-18 October 2002 at
Christiansborg.

Mr Larsen-Jensen identifies three main areas where efforts must be made
to increase democracy in the EU:

1.  National parliaments and the European Parliament are to intensify
    their co-operation
2.  National parliaments are to exert a greater influence on the
    European policy of their governments,
3.  The citizens are to be incorporated in European politics together
    with national parliaments.

## Remarks

Note: According to the [Councils rules of
procedure](http://ue.eu.int/uedocs/cms_data/docs/2004/6/21/Councils%20rules%20of%20procedure.pdf "wikilink"),
the Council needs unanimity to deviate from the 6 weeks. There needs to
be urgency.

\"The Council may unanimously derogate from the six-week period where
the entry of an item is subject to the exception on grounds of urgency
provided for in point 3 of that Protocol.\"

Otherwise, any member state and the EP can appeal. Quite a risk.
