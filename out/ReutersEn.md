*Reuters, like some other news agencies, has done a lousy job in
reporting on the European software patent situation. Their reports are
poorly researched and often characterised by made-up arguments of both
sides of the conflict, where the pro-patent side gets away very well.
Reuters has even signed an appeal in favor of software patents in
Europe.*
