*The British Computer Society is a large and prestigious union of people
working in computer programming and related fields of theory and
practise. A former president of BCS took strong positions against
software patents at a hearing in London 1998. Recently, the Computer
Society website has endorsed pro-patent fallacies and recommended
hardline pro-patent campaign groups.*
