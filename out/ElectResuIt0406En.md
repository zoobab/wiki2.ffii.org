-   Loss for Partito Radicale / Lista Bonino: Only 2 of 6 !MEPs from
    this very helpful group come back. Would like to know whether Marco
    Cappato is among them.
-   Alleanza Nazionale (UEN), which voted 100% with ffii recommendations
    and gave us active help especially through MEP Muscardini, seem to
    have won 1 more MEP.
-   Uniti nell\'Ulivo, the first party, is a collection of different
    parties and it is very difficult to know who of the
    [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") elected will be considered friend or foe. We
    have to wait for the final names elected and compare that to the
    declarations of interest we received before the elections.
