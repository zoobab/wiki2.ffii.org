# 18th May: webdemo against software patents {#th_may_webdemo_against_software_patents}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Last 18th May, the Council of the 25 Ministers reached an agreement
that would legalise software patents all over Europe. Since then, many
voices condamned this vote. The European Parliament is now under heavy
pressure from professional lobbyists of the big industry. They want to
convince elected representatives of Europe that this law can be good for
small and medium enterprises and Open Source software.*
