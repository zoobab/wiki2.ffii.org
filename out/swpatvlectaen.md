*Investors appreciate certificates that promise them a monopoly
position. However such promises are often unreliable, based on expensive
card houses, and the presence of patents in a field raises the risks
associated with investments in that field. Thus the comments from the
investor circles on software patents are rather diverse, ranging from
press releases of unknown start-ups boasting about monopoly positions
which they of course deservedly earned due to their enormous R&D
investments, to standard formulas in SEC filings by which giant
corporations deplore their fragility in view incaclulable patent risks.*

-   Document the perspectives of various venture capital investors,
    collect their opinions, provide some critical analysis.

    [November
    Conference](http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/test/ "wikilink")

    later static version of it)

## Sources of Distortion in Opinions {#sources_of_distortion_in_opinions}

-   Venture capitalists are happy when their company has a perspective
    of monopoly somewhere. For them a right to erect unjustified toll
    booths is just as good as a patent for very admirable research
    efforts. They are fairly insensitive to the question of what the
    effects of monopolies are on the economy as a whole. They just want
    the patents to be as broad as possible. Even if a minefield of
    patents decreases profitability, they may still be happy with the
    situation, because financing high-risk business is their job. VC is
    useful especially where chances of short-term product developments
    are low and investment is instead fuelled by hopes for long-term
    monopoly rents. Gene patents are a typical case, but in the software
    sector is is usually very easy to commercialise new ideas
    immediately. Software may not be a sector in which VC is a
    particularly fruitful approach. Some observers say that software
    companies enter a downward spiral when they start to become
    dominated by investors.
-   Sometimes patent lawyers masquerade as venture capitalists. Since
    patents play an important role in the capital market and patent
    lawyers are highly paid experts (paid for evaluating the patent
    situation in the market where a company wants to invest and for
    implementing the company\'s own patenting strategy), patent lawyers
    will tend to speak in the name of venture capitalists, although
    perhaps they are merely praising the system to which they owe their
    expert status rather than objectively assessing the overall effects
    of this system on the VC economy.
-   The VC market started late in Europe and is segmented into smaller
    national markets with regulatory burdens and disparities. Some (e.g.
    Sylvain Perchaud) say that this is the chief reason for its relative
    weakness in comparison to the US, others prefer to attribute the US
    strength to the US patent system.

## To do {#to_do}

-   obtain presentation of Sylvain Perchaud on European venture capital
    market given at [ffii conference of
    2004/04/14](http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/bxl44/prep/ "wikilink")
-   document the software related startup and VC scene
    -   -   in 2000 ENEF, an association of the software startup scene,
            joined our opposition against swpat, but they seem to have
            faltered with the dotcom boom
