The real question that needs to be asked is

1.  We welcome the EPO\'s new mission statement of \"strengthening
    innovation and economic growth in the interest of European
    citizens\". We, the Parliament have decided by large majority that
    certain classes of patents which are currently granted by the EPO do
    not serve innovation and economic growth. Is this reason enough for
    the EPO to consider stopping to grant such patents?
2.  Vice president Desantes said in Paris at OECD that indeed this might
    be a reason for the EPO to reconsider the whole policy on software.
    Desantes and his colleagues showed a remarkable spirit of political
    leadership, very much contrasting with that of the USPTO\'s
    officials at that conference. And it\'s not the only time that this
    has been remarked. Dr. Kober has said something similar to a Belgian
    newspaper last November. Art 52 seems to give you a legitimate basis
    for refusing to grant software and business method patents. In case
    you do consider this option, what obstacle is there to overcome?
3.  The current EPO practise on software appears to be based on a series
    of decisions taken by very few people at the Technical Boards of
    Appeal, from Vicom (1986) to IBM I & II (1998) and Pension Benefit
    Systems (2000). Did the TBA arrive at these decisions independently
    or do they reflect an underlying decision by the EPO (President or
    the Administrative Council)?
4.  Some say that not the TBA but only the Enlarged Board of Appeal
    (EBA) could possibly have been legitimated to take decisions on
    fundamental legal matters. To what degree are these decisions
    binding for the EPO today?
5.  Can the EPO not decide to adopt a different administrative practise,
    based on the political will that has been expressed by the
    Parliament, which is the only elected legislative body in the EU?
6.  What about taking the matter to the Enlarged Board of Appeal and
    asking them to overrule the TBA?

Moreover [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") could ask about the new CEC [proposal
for a quality control
division](http://www.ipjur.com/2003_11_01_archive.php3#106847819510593262 "wikilink"):

1.  Does the EPO president believe that such a quality control division
    would be a useful addition to the EPO structure ?
2.  Does the EPO president believe there are systematic problems of
    quality in the EPO\'s work ?
3.  Could he give an order-of-magnitude estimate of the number of \"bad
    patents\" which such a quality control division might prevent over
    the next several years, compared to a baseline of current policy and
    practice ?
4.  Is the EPO president the right person to choose the members of such
    a division, or would it be better for them to be independently
    nominated by the legislatures of the EPC member states (including
    the EU) ?
