# Patenting and Patent Lobbying Activities at SAP {#patenting_and_patent_lobbying_activities_at_sap}

*Only in 1999 did SAP start with its own patenting activities. This was
in reaction to litigation threats in the USA, based on trivial software
patents, which SAP could avoid only by paying 1,5 million USD to the
patentees. SAP woke up, installed a patent department and started
joining the lobbying efforts in favor of software patentability in
Europe. These efforts are very unpopular within SAP and among SAP
partners, but they have gained support from new top managers such as
Henning Kagermann. In the final weeks before the Parliament\'s 2nd
reading, SAP ran fullpage advertisements in Brussels newspapers calling
for support of the Council\'s Common Position which, as SAP said,
secured patentability of its achievements. These advertisements were
useful for arguing that the Common Position, in spite of all the
hypocrisy surrounding it, indeed legalises pure software and business
method patents.*

Companies like Siemens and SAP counter that they must protect the
inventions that are their lifeblood and on which they spend billions of
euros each year.

SAP\'s chief executive, Henning Kagermann, has been an outspoken
advocate of European software patents, arguing that the current position
puts Europe at a disadvantage to the United States, where software can
be patented.

And Siemens, which is Germany\'s biggest patent holder with 45,000
patents and spends more than ¬5bn (\$6.2bn) a year on research and
development, agrees.

\"We have about 30,000 software programmers, and of course we have a big
interest in protecting what they develop,\" a Siemens R&D spokesman
said.

## SAP\'s anti-open-source agenda? {#saps_anti_open_source_agenda}

-   [SapIp0405En](SapIp0405En "wikilink")

This staement could backfire at him internally a bit, because the
CRM/ERP market is expected to grow and Linux is the fastest growing
platform SAP is running on, from a recent interview:

-   <http://www.computerwoche.de/index.cfm?artid=46807&aktion=print>

Translation of the Linux part:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computerweek Germany: Companies are interested in Linux as Platform for
business/mission-critical applications. Which value has Linux for SAP?

Kagermann: Linux is very important for us. The share of installations
which run it is still low today but the growth rate is 60 to 70 per
cent. Especially we see this in Asia. In addition, there a Linux
ambitions in the public sector to not become addicted to one Supplyer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If SAP (as a whole) an anti-open-source agenda, then SAP would not have
made their mySAP suite generally available for use on Linux as reliable
OS in mission-critical environments back in 1999. And it would not
countinue to grow this customer base.

Besides the 70% growth of their Linux installs, SAP still has relatively
few patents, compared to MS and now MS also has got access to the 45.000
patents of SIEMENS which gives MS 55.000 patents with at least 3 more
every week.
