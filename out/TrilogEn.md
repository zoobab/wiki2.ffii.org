# Council trying to pressure again European Parliament with Trilog procedure {#council_trying_to_pressure_again_european_parliament_with_trilog_procedure}

*The Council Working Group of the Council have met today 3rd June and
last 27th May in order to discuss the amendments proposed by the
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") of the JURI comitee. There is high probability
that their opinion will result in blackmailing the work of the
Parliament in order to raise pressure on them before the vote of 6th of
July.*

The Trilog porcedure is used to speed up the negotiations and to draw a
position of Council Members faster. Normally, the Council has 3 months +
1 month after the vote in second reading of the European Parliament to
vote on the directive. With this informal Trilog procedure, it seems
that the Luxembourg presidency wants to gain time, and thus reduce the
amount of time during the one normally member states have the right to
work on the directive and eventually consult their national parliament.
This is another way to speed up negaotiations and to get rid of the
brakes that National Parliaments represents.
