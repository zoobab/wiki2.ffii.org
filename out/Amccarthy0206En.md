!McCarthy\'s entourage has claimed that this paper did not reflect
!McCarth\'s own views but those of Willy Rothley. This rumor was spread
with the intention of giving !McCarthy some more room for distancing
herself from the early pro-patent paper, but she later did not use this
room nor is the rumor very credible, although it is probably true that
Rothley worked on the dossier before !McCarthy was chosen to become the
SPE\'s rapporteur on it.
