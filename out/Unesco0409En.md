# International Competition for the Digitalization of the intangible heritage {#international_competition_for_the_digitalization_of_the_intangible_heritage}

Nabi Centre (Seoul) in cooperation with UNESCO and AVICOM:

\"Nabi Digital Storytelling Competition of Intangible Heritage\" Can
digital technology enrich the presence of intangible heritage?
Furthermore can it foster true intercultural dialogue among people from
different cultures? How would the new generation react, interact, or
even create new forms to express their intangible heritage?

These are the fundamental questions we are asking you to address through
the \"Nabi Digital Storytelling Competition of Intangible Heritage\".

In line with the 21st General Assembly of ICOM (International Council of
Museums) (2-8 October 2004, Seoul, Republic of Korea), Art Centre Nabi
is organizing this digital competition, aiming to promote creative
interpretations of intangible heritage through the use of interactive
multimedia tools and digital storytelling technologies, with the support
of AVICOM, the Korean National Commission for

`UNESCO (KNCU), and the UNESCO `[`DigiArts`](DigiArts "wikilink")` Project.`

The competition especially seeks to encourage young practitioners in
various fields of creativity to reflect on the theme of intangible
heritage and to send project proposals for multimedia productions. The
participants are expected to not only discover innovative ways of
virtual artistic expressions but also bring about interactive platforms
for a better mutual understanding to intangible heritage and to living
cultural communities.

The prize consists of three parts: 1st prize: USD 5000\$ 2nd prize: USD
3000\$ 3rd prize: USD 2000\$
