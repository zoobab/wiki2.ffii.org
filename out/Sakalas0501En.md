## Saulius Grazulis reports: {#saulius_grazulis_reports}

On 2005.01.24 I have phoned Prof. Aloyzas Sakalas, Lithuanian MEP and
member of JURY, and asked him to support the restart of the Computer
Implemented directive. He sounded friendly and asked for the documents
stating our position in english. I have forwarded him documents
\'ffii-rationale.pdf\' and \'kahin-rationale.pdf\' from
<http://www.elis.ugent.be/~jmaebe/nobackup/restart05/>. He has also
received our former letters to the Lithuanian vice-minister signed by
the scientific council of our the Institute of Biotechnology and a
letter of AKL (Open Source Lithiania) organisation stating our concerns
about the dangers of sw-pats.

He said that he needs some time to study the documents, and that he
wants to have oppinion of the other side as well, and he will contact
Lithuanian insdustry association for their oppinion as well.

I strongly hope that he will be persuaded by our logical arguments (he
is a physicist, and physicists are trained to think logically :).

Apparently, he did not have complete information about the problems with
software patents, and I hope that the information has reached him just
in time.
