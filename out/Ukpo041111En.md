Someone posted an alleged response from the UKPO without specifying to
which question posed by whom the response was directed and where it was
published. The response explains how the Patent Office is in charge of
\"secondary legislation\" in the Ministry and of lawmaking in the EU
Council. It also illustrates once more how the UKPO is committed to
influencing public opinion on the patent system in its favor.

## Response to Inquiry (Janette [McNeill](McNeill "wikilink"), UKPO) {#response_to_inquiry_janette_mcneill_ukpo}

The UK Patent Office is part of the executive branch, namely the
Department of Trade & Industry (DTI), and through DTI Ministers it is
responsible to Parliament. As such it may publish information on issues
for which it has responsibility. The information published recently
reflects Government policy as decided by Ministers. It also includes the
views of an SME, which was based on its own experience. We are also
aware of other companies or individuals who have been able to use
patents to gain a foothold in competitive markets, such as James Dyson
(vacuum cleaners), [ Mandy Haberman](MandyHabermanEn "wikilink") (the
Anywayup ® Cup) and Ted Prosser (inventor of \"Paint-n-Grain\" marketed
by Ronseal). Other examples are given on websites such as

In the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, Ministers are given the power to
make delegated (secondary) legislation. In most cases - and certainly in
the case of legislation in the field of patents - such legislation is
subject to the control of the UK Parliament. Parliament itself makes
primary legislation, such as the recent Patents Act 2004. Within Europe,
DTI Ministers are involved as part of the Council in making EU
legislation. And the Patent Office, as part of the DTI, naturally has a
role in formulating the UK\'s position on patents issues (as well as on
other aspects of intellectual property).

The Courts have sole competence to rule on the interpretation of the
law, which the Patent Office then applies to individual cases. Its own
decisions may be challenged through the Courts.
