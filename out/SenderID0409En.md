------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft owns a patent on a basic method which is part of an IETF draft
standard for a scheme against e-mail spam. Microsoft is allowing use of
this patent under a license which excludes free software such as the
Apache webserver from participation. The Apache Software Foundation has
announced its non-participation in the standard. It is however difficult
to create alternatives without this method which Microsoft happens to
have registered first. Unfortunately none of the many news reports gives
the number of Microsoft\'s patent. Microsoft\'s License FAQ deliberately
evades the question of which patents might be encumbering Sender ID,
saying that the process is ongoing and detailed research of these
patents at this time would be disadvantageous to Microsoft. Therefore we
can not find out to what extent similar patents are pending in Europe.

## Microsoft Licensing FAQ: why we are not disclosing the concerned patent claims {#microsoft_licensing_faq_why_we_are_not_disclosing_the_concerned_patent_claims}

Q11: Microsoft has not told us what patent rights it holds? How can we
evaluate Microsoft\'s patent claims?

A: Unpublished patent applications are held in confidence by the US
Patent & Trademark Office. When the application is published, Microsoft
will update its patent disclosure with the IETF. In recognition of their
confidential status and the desire to acquire early information
regarding the possibility of patent claims being granted that cover the
standard, the IETF, like some other organizations, encourages its
members to disclose the \"existence\" of such patent applications. It
does not ask that the patent holder disclose the content of its
confidential patent application. Microsoft has followed the processes
for disclosure outlined in RFC 3668 entitled \"Intellectual Property
Rights in IETF Technology.\" Since the patent application containing the
claim has not yet been granted it is not clear what patent rights, if
any, Microsoft will ultimately be awarded. Consequently, a detailed
evaluation may only lead to speculative conclusions at this time. To
provide additional certainty under these uncertain circumstances
Microsoft\'s license includes all necessary patent rights that Microsoft
has now or is later granted.
