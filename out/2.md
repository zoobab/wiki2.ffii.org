This set of amendments was based on a year of work in the Parliament\'s
committees for
[Culture](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/juri0312/ "wikilink")
and
[Industry](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/itre0312/ "wikilink").
It was imposed against the will of the leading Legal Affairs Committee,
whose leading figures [Arlene
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/amccarthy/ "wikilink"),
[Joachim
Wuermeling](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/jwuermeling/ "wikilink") and
[Malcolm Harbour](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/mharbour/ "wikilink")
had rejected the work of the other committees and, in close cooperation
with the patent establishment, proposed a set of [fake limits on
patentability](http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/juri0617/ "wikilink"),
which however did not succeed in deceiving fellow !MEPs in the plenary
vote.
