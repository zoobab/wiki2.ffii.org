------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday, 2004-11-05 at 13:00, invited by state secretary Wlodzimierz
Marcinski, representatives of many Polish organizations, companies and
institutions, met in the polish Ministry of Science and Informatization
to analyze to directive on software patents accepted as a political
agreement by the Council of EU on 18 may 2004.

## Participants

Among the participants where:

-   the Minister, State Secretarty and a few other staff from the
    Ministry of Science and Informatization
-   Undersecretary of State from the Ministry of Economy
-   president and a few experts from the polish Patent Office
-   representatives of [FFII Poland](http://www.ffii.org.pl "wikilink"),
    ISOC-PL, PTI
-   PRO - largest polish proprietary software producers association
-   PIIT - Polish Chamber of Informatics and Telecommunications
-   several patent lawyers and CEO\'s of patent attonery companies
-   representatives of Sun, Novell, HP and Microsoft

## Testsuite Approach {#testsuite_approach}

A few weeks in advance the interested parties where asked to prepare
example patents which they want to be analyzed at the conference,
express an opinion should they be patentable, and wheather they are
patentable under the analyzed directive.

The methodology was approximately that of the
[testsuite](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/testsuite/ "wikilink") which
has been advocated by the FFII and refused by the patent lobby and its
governmental followers in other EU member states for many years.

## Nearly 100% Rejection of Council Position, Overwhelming Support for Parliament {#nearly_100_rejection_of_council_position_overwhelming_support_for_parliament}

During the conference the Ministry asked all participants three
questions:

1\) do you think that the directive as accepted on 18 may 2004 by the
Council allows software patents?

Everyone agreed that it fully does. Not a single patent lawyer or big
business lobbyist objected.

2\) do you think that software patents should be allowed?

Everyone except two patent lawyers (who spoke only for themselves)
agreed that they should not.

3\) what would you like to be done with the directive?

NGOs agreed that it should be ammended in the way European Parliament
did it last year. Sun called for rejecting the directive, Novell and HP
also support that position.

It\'s significant that the Polish Patent Office fully supported the
negative opinion about the Council Agreement, recommended retracting the
support for it, and rediscussing it.
