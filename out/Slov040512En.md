# 2004-05-12 Slovenian Opposition against Council Proposal frustrated by Germany {#slovenian_opposition_against_council_proposal_frustrated_by_germany}

From Slovenia we received the following report:

`Our diplomats actually got the new officialy coordinated position of`\
`slovenia - to support LU and DE amendments, but unfortunately... DE has`\
`lifted all reservations on May 5th, before our support for it was`\
`declared, so it was impossible to support it afterwards. Thing is now a`\
`A item, so it will not be discussed between ministers, only voted.`

This corresponds with unenlightened reactions from the [ responsible
officials in the German ministry of justice](RaimundLutzDe "wikilink")
in conversations with a swelling [ flood of
letters](SwpatxatraDe "wikilink"). However, on the [ Berlin action
day](DemoBerlin0405De "wikilink") government representatives again
[promised](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/47314 "wikilink") to
oppose the [Council
position](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/ "wikilink").

On 2004-05-12 the slovenian Ministry of information society has issued a
statement that it officially stated support for german (ex)opinion.

But the message is so carefully worded and vague, that it is possible to
nterpret it in two different ways:

1.  that Slovenia has officially stated its view in EU decision making
    process
2.  that the ministry has officially stated its view inside the internal
    Slovenian coordination process

This may have been done intentionally in order to mislead the most of
the press.

In Slovenia, as elsewhere, the Council decisions are handled by the
patent office (i.e. the [Slovenian Intellectual Property
Office](http://www.uil-sipo.si/ "wikilink")). While the information
society ministry has [publicly stated opposition to software
patents](http://plone.ffii.org/events/2004/ljub05/ "wikilink"), it may
not be willing to risk serious conflicts with SIPO or, as an EU
newcomer, with the perceived \"compromise position\" of the other
Council members.
