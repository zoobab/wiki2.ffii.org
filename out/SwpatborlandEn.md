*Borland is a leading company in compilers for the IBM PC platform. At
the USPTO hearings of 1994, Borland pronounced itself against the
introduction of software patents. Meanwhile Borland has stockpiled
numerous patents that are getting into the way of software developpers,
e.g. of the Wine project.*
