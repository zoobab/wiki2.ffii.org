## Insulating FFII.org from legal dangers {#insulating_ffii.org_from_legal_dangers}

-   Currently resource drain due to legal matters is minimal because of
    our self-censorship.
-   The responsibility for certain legal matters will be inherited by a
    separate organisational entity this month. This entity will
    specialise on dealing with legal matters ie Germany. FFII, it is
    proposed, will help raise funds for this entity.
-   Fork out centers of responsibility that are insulated from FFII.org,
    such as
    -   -   national sections
        -   lawyer organisations that take editorial responsibility
            (e.g. FFII Publishing Company)
-   We have entrusted KPMG to propose a good scheme for this.

## National Sections {#national_sections}

-   Actions need to be taken at a national level for a democratical
    monitoring of patenting practices, resolutions or laws need to be
    passed in order to rectify circumvention of EPC or prevent
    governmental patent officials from signing dangerous
    intergovernmental proposals. Thus, interactions with national
    parliaments, governements and other national bodies, for eg.
    Economic & Social Councils, need to be improved.
-   In some member states there are important non-patent initiatives,
    e.g. on open standards in public administration or rollback of
    judicial over-regulation, to be pursued.
-   FFII\'s national organisational entities with offices need to be
    registered
-   Some national initiatives need paid activists and initial funding
    before they can fund themselves.
-   Some national FFII initiatives need mentors and assistence, such as
    [ FFII Brasil](FfiiBrEn "wikilink") and [FFII
    Slovakia](http://ffii.skosi.org/ "wikilink") (currently set up), see
    also [FfiiRegioEn](FfiiRegioEn "wikilink")

## UN

-   WIPO and WSIS work currently handled by André Rebentisch
-   some travel expenses need to be paid

## Economic-Majority.com {#economic_majority.com}

-   Once the Basic Mass Communication Work is in place, it may become
    possible to revitalise economic-majority.com according to the
    MLM-like
    ([Multi-Level-Marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing "wikilink"))
    concept proposed and partially practised last June.
