*Microsoft is reported to be inclined to build its European headquarter
in Luxemburg after special efforts undertaken by Luxemburg\'s minister
of economics Jean-Claude Krecké. On March 7th Krecké, as president of
the Council meeting on software patents, declared a position in favor of
unlimited patentability to have been adopted, although there was no
longer a majority for this position and several countries had demanded
or were obliged to demand renegotiation.*

This is at least what an informant from Luxemburg tells us. The
background documents can be found at

We need some texts quoted and evaluated here.

There was also a nice newspaper advertisment \"Buy an EU Law\" on
Luxemburg\'s Council lawmaking services.
