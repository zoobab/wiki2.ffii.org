# FFII: Afflux to the entrepreneur campaign Economic Majority {#ffii_afflux_to_the_entrepreneur_campaign_economic_majority}

\[ [ News](SwpatcninoEn "wikilink") \| [Economic
Majority](http://www.economic-majority.com "wikilink") \]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The SME initiative Economic Majority, which was only started in April,
could on 23-6 announce the support of the thousandth enterprise. Six
days later, on 29-6-05, there are now already over 1500 enterprises.
Many of these entrepreneurs met today in Brussels at an E-M conference.*

As a full success, the [entrepreneur initiative \"Economic
Majority\"](http://www.economic-majority.com "wikilink") is proof for
clear borders in relation to the patenting of software. Started as
recently as April, it could today exceed the barrier of 1500 registered
small and middle enterprises.

Stephan Uhlmann announced by E-Mail:

`here are the latest stats:`

`more than 1,500 companies`\
`more than 28,000 employees`\
`more than 1.8 billion euros annual turnover`\
`(at least, employees+turnover fields are optional and not all supporters `\
`decide to fill them in).`\
`66 testimonies.`

`We started collecting April 25th (very slowly back then, the recent PR gave us `\
`a good boost). These days we have an average of more than 50 new `\
`registrations per day.`

On 29-6-05 there was in Brussels a [conference of the initiative
Economic
Majority](http://www.economic-majority.com/konf050629/ "wikilink") as a
last signal before the vote. Numerous entrepreneurs and speakers spoke
up and discussed the necessary improvements to the guideline. In
particular, the topic Astroturfing was discussed intensively by the SME
representatives. The claim to speak on behalf of the \"Economic
Majority\" with an initiative of currently 1500 enterprises, soon
probably to be already over 2000 enterprises, seems to be a bold one.
Numerous studies and the empirical findings from the patent data base
show however clearly that a software patent regime is against the
interest of the small and medium-sized enterprises, on whose shoulders
the European software economy rest.

### What is the problem with the \"Astroturfing\" in matters concerning software patenting in Brussels? {#what_is_the_problem_with_the_astroturfing_in_matters_concerning_software_patenting_in_brussels}

The international companies created for themselves their \"own middle
class\" as their representation in Brussels. \"Astroturfing\", the
lobbyism from the retort, is the newest cry in the Public Affairs
domain. In addition comes the financing of an obscure network of
classical industrial lobbyists. In Brussels in the last months numerous
pseudo [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") arose and lobbied for software patenting.
Those are frequently PR specialists, who pose themselves as
entrepreneurs. Sometimes the hired lobbyists also have their own
enterprises, e.g. a Web Design company, which however only have to do
with software as users. There are naturally also entrepreneurs, who with
untrue statements about the guideline were merged into the lobbying
circus. Or dubious initiatives, which are financed by multinational
companies, to juggle support for their positions by SME or creatives.
One of them, the close to the Microsoft federation CompTIA (also:
Initiative for Software Choice) [\"Campaign for Creativity\", was
publicly reprimanded on the previous day by Lobbywatch and other
civilian-social transparency
initiatives](http://www.corporateeurope.org/lobbycracy/prc4c.html "wikilink").

A publication of ECC (now: Pleon), which officially represents Public
Affairs of Microsoft in Brussels, explains this as a reactive trend on
successes of the civilian-social groups: \"professional campaign
management is in the meantime for a long time no longer only limited to
the hard core of politics. After citizens\' initiatives,
[NGOs](NGOs "wikilink") or environmental activists such as Greenpeace,
the economy and its organisations now also feel the change and are
bestirred by campaign ability\.... Because in the execution and
organization of Public Affairs campaigns some samples from the political
management are applicable.\"(1)

Creating instant movements, here of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), is
derogatively called \"Astroturfing\" in the PR jargon. Astroturf is a
well-known US trademark for artificial turf. This is an ironical
allusion to the American \"grass roots\". Astroturfing sets up
intransparency of interests and financing structures. Such
transparencies are a threat for the functioning of the parliamentary
opinion forming. This particularly applies to the \"spaceship
Brussels\". The members of the European parliament are misled
purposefully over the interests of medium-size enterprises.

The enterprises of the initiative \"Economic Majority\" want to have
none of such masquerade and want their voice heard in the European
Parliament without false guise. In their campaign, financing and support
lie in one hand.
