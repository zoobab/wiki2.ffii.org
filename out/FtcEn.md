The FTC is an independent governmental agency of the United States of
America, with 5 commissioners appointed for a term of .. years by \...

Charged with securing free competition and investigating
anti-competitive behaviour.

Has recently held hearings and reported about problems with the patent
system, especially in the area of software and business methods.

### from the Conclusion (Chapter 3, IV.G page 152): {#from_the_conclusion_chapter_3_iv.g_page_152}

Panelists in the hardware and semiconductor industries emphasized
**competition** as a driver of innovation. Trade secret protection also
contributes to innovation in these industries. Testimony regarding the
role of patents was **mixed**. The record generally corresponded with
the results obtained by Professors Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh in their
business survey of appropriability mechanisms for firms in the United
States: the semiconductor industry was **among the least reliant** on
patents to appropriate returns on investment in R&D. \[281\] \...

The hearing record highlighted many of the issues that economists
suggested might arise in contexts that involve cumulative innovation and
a multiplicity of patents. Specifically, the participants from these
industries **confirmed** a trend toward **defensive** patenting and
stated that patents can **deter** innovation:

-   \(1\) by contributing to patent **thickets**, and
-   \(2\) through their use by [NPEs](NPEs "wikilink") to hold up
    [PPEs](PPEs "wikilink").

Panelists also observed that various patent licensing arrangements -
cross-licensing, patent pools, and the licensing requirements of
standard setting organizations - have helped to mitigate the potential
**harm to innovation** caused by patent thickets.
