# SME Envoy {#sme_envoy}

There seems to be an [SME
Envoy](http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/entrepreneurship/sme_envoy/ "wikilink").
From the page:

The SME Envoy **acts as a key interface with the SME community,
considering their specific interests and needs in** EU Programmes and
**legislation**. Thanks to the SME Envoy, **SME interests and needs can
be better identified at an early stage and highlighted** to the relevant
Commission services, so **ensuring that their concerns are taken into
consideration and that adequate and efficient measures are
implemented**.

He addresses concrete enterprise policy issues of current interest, such
as improving the financial environment of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"),
**better regulation**, **implementation of the Internal Market**,
developing high quality support services for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") or
ensuring easier access to European programmes. The SME Envoy pays
particular attention to the craft sector, small businesses and sole
traders because of their specific needs.
