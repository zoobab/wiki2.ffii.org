Strategic Partner was most recently in senior public affairs positions

Again, Patent agents (also called patent attorneys nowadays) and likely
a number of [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") (or fakes such as companies which
have been created from large companies by moving their departments into
a smaller body, who\'s [CEOs](CEOs "wikilink") are former Managers if
the \"Mother\") will speak in favour of the Council text, in the name of
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), however it\'s hard to know for an average MEP:

## Impact on [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") {#impact_on_smes}

The question wether patents are of benefit to [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") or
rather to their detriment has been raised by a significant number of
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink").

`Various short interventions will provide a appraisal of the potential impact of the Directive on `[`SMEs`](SMEs "wikilink")`, explain how different business models impact the `**`collaboration`` ``between`` ``large`` ``and`` ``small`` ``businesses`**` /emphasis is not in the original flyer) and finally present sme concrete examples from SME `[`CEOs`](CEOs "wikilink")`.`

Together this will lead to a better understanding of what the Common
Position wil mean for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and what some of the
proposed amendments could mean for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")
