*The Swedish truck company Scania does not own many patents, especially
not in the software field. However, in view of the growing importance of
the patent system and the monopolisation possibilities which it offers
to Scania and its competitors, Scania hired a patent lawyer Fredrik
Egrelius with the task of promoting software patenting within the
company. Egrelius subsequently became a lobbyist who promoted software
patentability in Stockholm and Brussels in the name of Scania and the
(Swedish) automobile industry.*
