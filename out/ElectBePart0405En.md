## Wallonia

The greens (http://www.ecolo.be) are opposed to the current proposal
(the same could be said of all the Greens of Europe, I think). PS is
also clearly opposing software patents and has been active in opposing
the [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") line within the European Socialist
group (PSE). [ Olga Zrihen](OlgaZrihenEn "wikilink") has been
particularly helpful. Independent of the voting results, which may
contain compromises with [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink"), it can be said
that PS has been the most helpful belgian force in the EP.
