The Parliament,

Having heard the deliberations,

Considering the uniqueness of the European Parliament wanting to invoke
article 55 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament,

Considering that not waiting for the answer of the Commission to the
request of the European Parliament to restart the procedure concerning
the software patents could lead to a serious clash of the European
Institutions,

Considering that in order to avoid a possible clash of the Institutions
it would be good to wait for the decision of the Commission concerning
the restart of the procedure,

Calls upon the government to devote itself to ensuring that the subject
of software patents will not be put on the agenda as an A-Item before
the Commission has answered the request of the European Parliament to
restart this dossier.

And proceeds to the order of the day.
