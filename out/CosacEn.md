COSAC is a forum for involvement of national Parliaments in EU
lawmaking. It has its legal basis in an additional protocol to the
Amsterdam Treaty. National Parliaments have largely been marginalised by
the process of EU legislation. This becomes particularly clear when
looking at how national parliaments were misinformed and ignored by the
fusioned executive bodies in the EU Council during the Council\'s first
reading of the software patent directive in 2004.
