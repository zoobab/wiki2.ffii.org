# Questions for Journalists to Ask at Press Conference {#questions_for_journalists_to_ask_at_press_conference}

-   Why has DE voted for the proposal although it has explicitly
    announced on May 12 that it would not do so?!

-   You say that you do not want patents on algorithms and business
    methods. However the European Patent Office has already granted more
    than 30000 patents on algorithms and business methods, including
    such things as the runlength coding used in the JPEG standard and
    Amazon\'s E-Commerce methods. Now as I understand the text, the
    European Parliament\'s proposal would make these patents invalid,
    while yours would make them valid, wouldn\'t it? Could you tell me
    approximately how many of the EPO\'s patents the Parliament\'s
    proposal would make invalid, how many the Council proposal would
    make invalid?

-   Apparently the Council wants more software patents to be granted
    than the European Parliament. Now there seems to be a large
    consensus of software developers, software companies and economists
    that it would be more desirable to have fewer patents in this area.
    This has even been said in study reports from the European
    Commission, the European Economic and Social Council, the European
    Council of the Regions and the European Parliament. Could you
    explain why now suddenly the governments seem to believe that having
    more patents on what you call \"computer-implemented inventions\"
    (i.e. basically algorithms and business methods) is helpful to
    Europe\'s economy?

-   Article 5.2 says that a computer program on its own can be claimed
    under certain circumstances. Does this not conflict with the
    statement that patents on computer programs as such are not allowed
    by the Council proposal?

```{=html}

```
-   -   (ccorn\'s version, deemed being packed too much) Article 5 of
        the council version of the directive wants computer-implemented
        processes and their descriptions to be patentable. Given that
        computer programs are precisely that, namely descriptions of
        computer-implemented processes, there is a contradiction to
        article 52(2) EPC which says that, among others, computer
        programs must not be mistaken as inventions. How can art.5 of
        the council version then increase legal certainty instead of
        decreasing it?

-   You say that pure software patents will not be allowed, because the
    invention has to have a further technical effect. However, you do
    not define technical anywhere, and the European Patent Office
    interprets this for example as \"it makes a computer run faster\".
    How does the Council proposal render this interpretation invalid?

```{=html}

```
-   Article 2b allows non-technical features to add a so-called
    \"technical contribution\" as long as the claim as a whole comprises
    technical features, e.g. a generic computer. How can this limit
    anything?

-   The Council proposal wants to guarantee the right to interoperate by
    referring to the European antitrust laws. How does this help an SME
    which cannot interoperate with a program from e.g. Microsoft because
    of a patent? Won\'t such proceedings take too long and won\'t the
    SME be bankrupt long before the investigations have even started?

```{=html}

```
-   property law is currently still assigned to member states, and
    European Courts have decided that consequentially, this is also the
    case for intellectual property. Won\'t this cause problems for EU
    antitrust authorities when trying to deal with software patent
    abuses?
