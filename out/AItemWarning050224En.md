THIS IS OUTDATED. See <http:SwpatcninoEn> for 7 March A-item news.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear FFII supporter,

on Thursday evening a supporter has received an email of Kuenast (German
minister of agriculture) assistant saying \"I am writing on behalf of
Renate Kuenast. On February 28th the \'Common Position\' will be
formally confirmed on a meeting of the Agriculture and Fishery
Ministers.\" If one wants to nod through an A-Item, the Monday date
would have been selected diligently: !MEPs are on their way from a
Strasbourg session back to Brussels and - that might be the scheme -
over the weekend mobilization might be more difficult.

Immediate action is thus recommended, hence we are sending out this
email since night and ask you to use your politcial contacts to ensure
that the software patent directive is no A-item on 28 February. On the
other hand immediate action also implies that we have not been able to
verify that email from a second source, and ask your for verification or
falsification, most recent results are published at

<http://wiki.ffii.org/AItemWarning050224En> ![Wiki, section
\"Intelligence\"](this "wikilink")

(we would ask you to check there after opening ths mail and add the
result of your own inquiries.)

With kind regards,
