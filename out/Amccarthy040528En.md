In a [Wired
article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63628,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4 "wikilink"),
the UK Labour MEP who reported on the software patent directive for the
European Parliament and was overruled by this parliament last september,
[ Arlene [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink"),
says that software companies need patents to protect their interests and
the opponents, whom she sees only in the [free software
movement](http://swpat.ffii.org/players/fsa/ "wikilink"), are naive and
spreading a \"[barrage of
misinformation](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/amccarthy030901/ "wikilink")\".

At the same time !McCarthy claims that she is favor of the European
Parliament\'s amendments of last september. These amendments in fact
confirm the non-patentability of software and would thereby, as
industrial patent lawyers have been vociferously saying, lead to the
annullation of software patents granted by the EPO, i.e. those patents
that !McCarthy says are necessary.

!McCarthy is probably afraid that her party will not nominate her as
rapporteur again. For this reason she pretends to be in favor of the
amendments for which her party voted, while at the same time preparing
for a role as a negotiator of \"compromises\" with the [
Council](Cons0401En "wikilink"), which she will be trying to sell to the
Parliament. This is basically what !McCarthy did in 2003 as a JURI
rapporteur. The [JURI
amendments](http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/eubsa-swpat0202/tech/#cecjuri "wikilink")
came from the Council \"experts\" and are now part of the Council
\"compromise\". The common form of these amendments is \"Software is
never never never [more rhetorical bloat that simulates fierce
commitment \...](... "wikilink") patentable, unless \[ \... more bloat,
upon closer scrutiny a condition that is always true \... \].\"
