## Synopsis

Novell today publicly commited to use its patent portfolio to protect
its open source software offerings. In a policy statement, Novell said
it would utilize its patent portfolio to defend against potential
intellectual property attacks by others on its open source products. The
statement serves to reassure customers that they can choose open source
solutions with confidence, knowing they have strong backing from Novell
on patent issues.

    turning Netware into an extension to Linux and therefore has a
    stronger interest than most other large companies in defending at
    least the Linux kernel)

## Quotes

\"In the event the European Union were to allow broader patentability of
software, Novell would nonetheless be able to freely market its software
offerings, whether closed or open source, in Europe and other
jurisdictions that presently favor software patents.\"

in the future demand patent indemnification as part of their contract
conditions for (OSS-related ?) software contracts.

## Comments

1.  1.  This comment cited some wrong assumtions, it\'s better to remove
        parts and turn it into a more genera comment than having to
    2.  critisise the drafter for misrepresenting what Novell really
        said.

When the text says that \"the current regime has served the industry
well, directive not needed\", he could have copy&pasted this from [
EICTA](SwpateictaEn "wikilink")\'s hardline-pro-patent statements. In
the EPO software patent professional\'s ear, this is a statement in
favor of unlimited patentability according to the EPO\'s recent
standards, which, as far as general-purpose software is concerned, do
not significantly differ from those of the US.

However in the ear of unexperienced software developpers at Novell in
Europe (e.g. !SuSE), it sounds as if Novell was supporting the
provisions of the current European law, which clearly forbid software
patents.

Novell\'s lawyers reinforce this misunderstanding by treating the
[Council\'s
version](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/tab/ "wikilink")
of the text as the only version on the table and avoiding any mention of
the [Parliament\'s
version](http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/ "wikilink"). By
taking a position on the Parliament\'s version, he would have had to
reveal himself.

Novell\'s lawyers clearly needed to hide their positions in this way,
because it is well known that most of Novell\'s employees dislike the
software patent system and some national sections have even made this
clear in public statements (see e.g.
[Warszawa040510En](Warszawa040510En "wikilink")).

Nobody can expect Novell to bear the enormous burden of \"defending
opensource software\". Nobody can blame Novell for rationally playing
the patent game, which was imposed on our business community by external
forces.

We would however have hoped that Novell take an unambiguous stand on the
public policy questions concerning the basic rules of exclusivity and
competition of the software business community. This is a minimum
requirement of \"social responsibility\", a much-cited value in
corporate image brochures.
