Prof Tamai of Tokyo University shows how patenting of software clashes
with some of the underlying assumptions of the patent system. The patent
system relies on requirements such as concreteness and physical
substance in order to keep the breadth of claims within reasonable
limits. Software innovation however is the art of making processes as
general as possible, i.e. the art of abstraction. Tamai quotes a set of
patent claims from the SOFTIC symposium of 1993, where patent officials
from JP, US and EU judged the patentability of an example algorithm at
different levels of concretisation. The European representative was more
willing than his colleagues from US and JP to grant patents on abstract
claims, but even he shyed back from granting them at the level that
really represents the innovative achievement. Tamai shows how this
inconsistency leads to a series of other inconsistencies. Tamai sees
only two ways out of the inconsistency: (1) acceptance of abstract
claims (2) exclusion of software patents.
