------------------------------------------------------------------------

*21st April 2005 \-- The European Parliament\'s Legal Affairs Committee
discussed Michel Rocard\'s proposed Report on the Software Patent
Directive. The room was full of pro-patent lobbyists who made their
preferences audible by sneering laughing, e.g. at Rocard. Many MEP//s
echoed positions of these lobbyists, claiming that small companies need
software patents or that the 1st reading amendments excluded much more
than software. Few had the needed knowledge/courage to support the
rapporteur\'s approach of basically reinstating 1st reading amendments
so as to position the EP for effective exclusion of software patents.*

## Recording

The recording has been made with an integrated microphone, the room was
full, many lobbyists from Big Industry were present ([
Mingorance](SwpatmingoranceEn "wikilink"), [
IBM](SwpatibmEn "wikilink"), [ EICTA](SwpateictaEn "wikilink"), [
UNICE](SwpatuniceEn "wikilink"), [
Ericsson](SwpatericssonEn "wikilink"), [ Volvo](VolvoEn "wikilink"),
etc\...). The recording is in the original languages.

## Informal summary {#informal_summary}

Total length (1hr 45):

### 00:00 fr Rocard {#fr_rocard}

[ Michel Rocard](MichelRocardEn "wikilink"):

-   First part of the recording is an introduction by rapporteur Michel
    Rocard which is more or less the same as his [ introduction letter
    to JURI members](Rocard050413TextFr "wikilink").
-   Only addition: comments on forces of nature - invented by a German
    court, and taken up in Polish and Swedish legislation

### \* 19m, X, es {#m_x_es}

### 22m de Lehne {#m_de_lehne}

[ Klaus-Heiner Lehne](KlausHeinerLehneEn "wikilink")

-   Be careful with IPR, Lisbon, \... The EPO needs enough leeway to
    make decisions;
-   then reads aloud the letter of UNICE : the EP 1st reading will
    eliminate all patents in modern fields of technology \... everybody
    wants to protect [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") without undermining the
    basis on which the industry was based.

### 28:26 en Crowley {#en_crowley}

[ Brian Crowley](BrianCrowleyEn "wikilink") (UEN, IE): [
Transcript](JuriCrowley050421En "wikilink")

-   The commission does not propose anything new;
-   this is not a battle btw big companies and small garage innovators,
    92% of patents in US have been granted to !SMEs;
-   what is not patentable now will not become patentable with this
    directive;
-   interoperability does not mean that an inventor can be denied its IP
    rights;
-   no interference with Trips;
-   make sure that we find the good 1st reading am to incorporate back
    into text.

### 34:25 en Kauppi {#en_kauppi}

[ Piia-Noora Kauppi](PiiaNooraKauppiEn "wikilink") (PPE, FI): [
Transcript](JuriKauppi050421En "wikilink")

-   majority of EP wants status quo, no steps backwards to the 1970s to
    exclude all software elements from patentability ; also a small
    leftist minority that tries to challenge the patent system ; problem
    of interpretation : what could be the effects of the different
    articles under the different versions
-   condemns the UNICE paper and lobbyists presenting EP 1st reading as
    the end of the world and threaten legislators
-   the council has been especially generous with the amendments, weak
    in article, we cannot accept the CP as it is.
-   concentrate on 5 key articles : 2-3-4-5-6 in those maybe some parts
    were the EP had gone too far should be changed from the 1st reading
    (too narrow def of industry ; data processing is not a field of
    technology ; article 6 maybe 1st reading goes too far- in the US
    this is possible but not optional, could be dropped, art 6 is the
    weakest point of the common position and interoperability is a key
    element, is a red line for EP)
-   study effects on !SMEs
-   the commission will publish a study on open source
-   art 7/8/9 are acceptable

### 53:40 de Lichtenberger {#de_lichtenberger}

[ Eva Lichtenberger](EvaLichtenbergerEn "wikilink") (Greens, AT):

-   council counts on us to improve the situation, as well as a number
    of national parliaments , the council has failed to take into
    account the EP am. as deserved.
-   endorses what MR said : distinction between technical and software
    is essential ; we - we are regulating about a matter of market
    access, it is also a matter of competition : how many licences does
    one have to paybefore turns on a computer ?! it is also a matter of
    monopolies
-   TRIPS : if we decide on the limit of patentability we have to decide
    for TRIPS it is also a question of scope of technical
-   we have to think of the degree of protection that IP gives ; is
    copyright efficient ? does that protection go far ? IP has to be
    protected but prevent that key areas are taken away from the
    accessible know-how.
-   we should not be driven along by companies saying that we are going
    back to the stone age
-   the definition of implemented has to be addressed
-   many persons agreed in public (even hard pro directive lobbyist)
    that sw should not be patented. The EP has to shut the back door.
-   software should be profitable and is protected by copyright

### de Mann {#de_mann}

[ Erika Mann](ErikaMannEn "wikilink") (PSE, DE):

-   EP needs to be flexible and should not retake all am from 1st
    reading
-   the conflict is not between big and small companies but between
    industries and programmers. Programmers have invented the internet,
    they have developed FLOSS and they want to keep that freedom. The
    industry, big and small, want to apply the patent law.
    Lichenberger\'s mantra against monopolies : should remember that
    often think of Microsoft and that Microsoft, but Microsoft became
    big under copyright law
-   !SMEs want patents to protect themselves against the big business;
    the FLOSS problem should be assessed but remember that IBM is an
    open source company. Open source and patents are not mutually
    exclusive, OS companies DO patent
-   US case law is backtracking is not as radical as used to be
-   does not mind the word natural forces but don\'t think that it does
    really prevent anything : for eg. in Japan they have it in the law
    but they patent business methods
-   should drop mechanical forces
-   stress good articles from the CP such as 7/8/9

### 01:04:16 de Berger {#de_berger}

[ Maria Berger](MariaBergerEn "wikilink") (PSE, AT):

-   there is a consensus in the committee
-   lobbyists are not helpful and misinterpret
-   the document of the rapporteur is good
-   it will leave the TRIP problem (?)
-   we have more allies in council than usual

### 01:15:13 de Lechner {#de_lechner}

[ Kurt Lechner](KurtLechnerEn "wikilink") (PPE, DE / German):

-   Patents can be used as a base for a loan; not copyright
-   pure sw different from software-related inventions
-   the Common Position can be improved

[ Giuseppe Gargani](GiuseppeGarganiEn "wikilink") (PPE, IT, JURI
Chairman): [ Transcript](JuriGargani050421En "wikilink")

### 1:25:14 Rocard

[ Transcript](JuriRocard050421Fr "wikilink")

-   Satisfied with this debate and agree with 90% of what others have
    said
-   Convergence of views between JURI members
-   \"We are not here to do philosophy but to do legislation, but we
    have to conciliate 3 things: profitability of industry, respect of
    market competition, free flows of ideas.\"
-   Thanks Lehne to have recall that \"we are in the key point of
    building of knowledge society\"
-   \"softwares are covered by copyright\"
-   Critics of approximations and violence in Unice\'s paper: Unice
    should have pushed forward his logic by asking clearly to \"reform
    art. 52 EPC\"
-   Debunk compatibility with TRIPS
-   Optimistic to find an agreement with Coucil on the basis that this
    directive is not about extending art. 52 EPC but about preserving
    status quo
-   EU is secured against JPO-style drift concerning \"forces of
    nature\" due to complementarity between this directive and art 52
    EPC, which clearly prevents software from patentability
-   EP has to negotiate with Council as soon as now.

Conclusions:

-   There is an agreement not to slip to the US practice
-   OK with Kauppi on interoperability
-   Copyright cannot be improved, with *this* directive, this is out of
    scope, what is on scope is to define clearly the limit of what is
    under copyright law and what is under patent law
-   Excess from free software people, it is not question to question the
    right of industry to be profitable
-   In this dossier those who defend the market are rather on the left
-   Vote 20/06

### 1:42:10 Noteboom

[ European Commission](SwpatcecEn "wikilink") [ Erik
Noteboom](ErikNoteboom "wikilink") (English): [
Transcript](JuriNoteboom050421En "wikilink")

-   the Commission wants transparency
-   The text of the rapporteur is excellent indeed main issues are art
    2+6
-   definitions : don\'t believe that this directive is the place where
    we should give an answer to the definition of technicality ; also
    because we should then ask ourselves what impact that could have on
    other domains such as chemistry ?!
-   MR definition is too restrictive because it means that processes
    inside a machine/computer/car cannot be patented
