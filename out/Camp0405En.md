------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lobby group for strong enforcement of broad exclusion rights, calling
itself [Campaign for
Creativity](http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/issues_so.htm "wikilink"),
is [attempting to find some people with real-life sob
stories](http://campaignforcreativity.org/camp4creativity/action.htm "wikilink").

The campaign site portrays the opponents of software patentability as a
handful of ideologues who are trying to deprive creators of the
legitimate fruits of their work. It does not give a single give any name
or web reference of this handful of ideologues, who must be extremely
powerful, since the site claims that the European Parliament voted for
harmful amendments, which \"destroy the incentive to create new
software\", just to \"appease\" this group.

A professionally designed web page, many people will actually buy it but
this site also proves that the pro-swapt lobby is neither naive nor
honest and will do anything it takes to win this, including actively and
openly promoting misinformation.

About Simon Gentry, the registrant for this page (see
<http://www.campbellgentry.com/pages/services/reputation.htm> ), he
lobbied for the pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (SB) on the EU
Life Patent Directive issue:

` "`\
` The pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (SB) has been one of the `\
` most aggressive campaigners for the Directive, launching its own lobby `\
` campaign even before `[`EuropaBio`](EuropaBio "wikilink")` existed. According to SB lobbyist Simon `\
` Gentry, the company allocated 30 million ECU from the start for a `\
` pro-Directive campaign.`\
` "`

30 million ECU (Eur) for a pro-EU Life Patent Directive campaign from a
single company, what should be the budget for the pro-SWPAT campaign?
