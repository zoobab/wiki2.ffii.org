Statement by Peter Mogensen, Chairman of [Digital Consumer
Denmark](http://www.digitalforbruger.dk "wikilink") regarding [Bill
Gates\' threats of moving Navision to
USA.](http://wiki.ffii.org/Navision050215En "wikilink") in an [interview
with
[ComOn](ComOn "wikilink").dk](http://comon.dk/index.php/news/show/id=21134 "wikilink")

This is pure extortion. Where patents can be taken out has nothing to do
with where development happens. Especially not when one is as big as
Microsoft. No matter whether the EU introduces software patents
Microsoft will not have better protection by moving Navision to USA.
Bill Gates uses Navision as extortion, even though what he threatens has
no relation to what he wants.

\...

It is of course sad about the 800 jobs if Navision moves, but legalizing
software patents will cost many more jobs in Denmark. Just Simcorp alone
who sincerely pleaded with the Committee on European Affairs not to
legalize software patents has 500 employees. We don\'t have any
guarantee that Microsoft won\'t move Navision to USA, India or somewhere
else, either. As described, location has nothing to do with where they
can take out patents.

\...

The politicians are facing a choice of protecting the danish software
industry or supplicating to Microsoft in a horse trade where Microsoft
gets software patents and Denmark can keep 800 specifik jobs in Vedbaek.
