# [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink") hearing: Divide et impera {#mccreevy_hearing_divide_et_impera}

## Quote

In response to questions on software patents raised by Maria BERGER
(PES, AT) and Heide RÃœHLE (Greens/EFA, DE), he acknowledged the concerns
of the open-source software community about effect of new patent laws.
\"These are aimed at creating legal certainty,\" he said. He professed
himself willing \"to enter discussions to reach a reasonable balance
which favoured neither one side nor the other.\"

## Comment

Legal certainty for the legal escape of the EPO means insecurity for the
software market.

The Commissioner cannot \"enter discussions to reach a reasonable
balance which favoured neither one side nor the other\" because his
administration is the driving forces for a unpleasent directive. The
European Parliament heavily amended the Commissions/BSA directive
because it was unacceptable. Even the council version 18-05-2004 was
largely based on pressure from the Commission. Bolkestein decepted the
government representatives. In fact there are no legitimate interest
groups in favour of software patents despite the patent system, patent
professionals and non-European stakeholders \-- or hired guns such as
the \"Campaign for Creativity\". The opposition to Bolkestein\'s line is
much broader than the \"Open Source Community\", it includes almost
everyone who works with software and faces problems with bad patent
pratice today. 350 000 Europeans signed the
[NoePatents-Petition](http://petition.eurolinux.org "wikilink").

We presented the requirements of our stakeholders (about 60 000 citizens
and SME)here: <http://swpat.ffii.org/analysis/needs/index.en.html>
