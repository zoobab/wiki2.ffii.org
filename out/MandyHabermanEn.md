------------------------------------------------------------------------

A technically savvy woman from the UK who \"invented the highly
successful Anywayup Cup\" (!CfC) and extracted revenues from it through
an even more successful patent. Various patent lobby organs have been
touting the Mandy Haberman success story. Mandy has not always been
happy about what was said. In November 2002 she wrote a letter to the
European Parliament in which she distances herself from efforts by UNICE
to use her example as an argument in favor of software patents.
