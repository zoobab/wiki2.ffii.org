# JURI Decision about Restart of Procedure on Software Patents {#juri_decision_about_restart_of_procedure_on_software_patents}

Restart](EuroparlSwpat04En "wikilink") \| [ Motion of 61

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[On 2 or 3 February
2005](http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep/owa/p_calag.meet_details?ipid=0&ilg=DE&idate=&igen=&iorg=C16&isorg=&iloc=&iclass=1&iorig=committees "wikilink"),
the [Committee for Legal Affairs of the European Parliament
(JURI)](http://www.europarl.eu.int/committees/juri_home.htm "wikilink")
will decide on whether the Parliament should have the option of
returning to a 1st reading of the proposed software patent directive
once the Council adopts a common position. This decision must be taken
before the Council\'s Position is transmitted to the Parliament. We
explain the procedure and present the arguments.

## Calendar

-   2005-01-25 [ UNICE](SwpatuniceEn "wikilink") member associations ask
    their members to lobby against restart, arguing that Council
    position is good for them and EP will have difficulty in getting the
    required high majorities to seriously amend it in 2nd reading
-   2005-01-24 [ Software patents not on the Fishery
    Agenda](Fish050124En "wikilink"), the way for JURI is free again
-   2005-01-19 [ Commission attempts to preclude JURI decision on
    restart](Juri050119En "wikilink") but fails due to Polish
    government\'s resistance
-   2005-01-10 [ restart motion of 61
    [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink")](Restart0501En "wikilink"), rejected by EP
    tabling office in defiance of rule 55(4) and without an explanation
    (tabling office policy seems to be to strengthen the party groups)

    please always be polite and friendly (we have been forwarded some
    massmails that are sent to numerous [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") at once,
    do not attempt to build any two-way communication and do not even
    mentioning the recipient MEP\'s names. That creates a bad impression
    and may even make [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") think \"not again \...
    let\'s go straight through the 2nd reading, as quickly as possible,
    so that we don\'t get so much junkmail \...\" )

## Write to non-legal affairs [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") {#write_to_non_legal_affairs_meps}

Note that although
[JURI](http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/p_meps.short_list?ilg=EN&icom=C16 "wikilink")
only has members from at, cz, de, es, fi, fr, hu, it, lt, nl, pl, uk,
you still can ask [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") from your country to put the
message through to them, this is also helpful to get a friendly climate
in the groups when they discuss whether to put it on the agenda of JURI
and the conference of presidents.

Moreover, it also might be helpful to write to the MEP you are in
contact with in your place, he might put the message through.
