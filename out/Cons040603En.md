[CEA-PME](http://www.cea-pme.org/ "wikilink") (association of more than
500,000 european [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")),
[ObjectWeb](ObjectWeb "wikilink") (consortium of large french
companies), FFII (60000 supporters, 1000 companies) and some members of
national parliaments have teamed up to call on EU member state
governments to reverse the EU Competiveness Council\'s decision of
2004-05-18.

It is unusual for the governments to do this, but in the current case it
seems clear that there is no real qualified majority behind the
decision, and, as EU law advisors of FFII [
note](ConsReversEn "wikilink"), there is no legal reason why heads of
state should not reverse this decision.
