------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Intellectual Property Committee (Gruppo Propriet√° Intellettuale) of
[Confindustria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confindustria "wikilink"),
the confederation of Italian employer associations, has sent a [
letter](ConfindustriaText0411It "wikilink") with an attached [ position
statement](ConfindustriaPaper0411It "wikilink") to the Italian members
of the European Parliament.

In this letter it stresses the importance of \"intellectual property\"
and says that \"patent protection\" must extend to software. In
particular the statement says that [ program
claims](EubsaProgEn "wikilink") as reintroduced by Art 5(2) of the [
Council Software Patent Agreement](Cons040518En "wikilink") are vital
and that the Parliament must approve this Council agreement without any
amendments. As might be expected, the paper supports its claims with the
authority of \"the industry\" rather than with reasoning.

This is not the first incident. On May 17 2004, Confindustria Lawyers
already issued a UNICE-style patent priest statement:
