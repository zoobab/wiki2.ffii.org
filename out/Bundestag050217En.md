*Berlin, 17 February 2005 \-- Today the German Federal Parliament is
scheduled to debate and adopt a cross-party motion against software
patents. The decision has already been postponed many times by the
governing coalition so as to allow the Council\'s zombie \"political
agreement\" of 18 May 2004 to be adopted first. Meanwhile it has become
impossible to delay further. Stay tuned here to read about the debate.*
