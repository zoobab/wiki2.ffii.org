*In the Netherlands, both the Parliament and the scientists who studied
the software patents question at the order of the government since 2000
have been clearly opposed to software patentability. However the
Ministry in charge has continuously ignored these studies, misinformed
the Parliament and acted contrary to its instructions on this dossier.
Even cross-party motions involving the governing parties did not help
against the combined power of the \"Royal\" company Philips and the
ministerial patent bureaucracy.*
