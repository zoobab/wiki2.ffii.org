LDYS
[Motion](http://www.ldys.org.uk/web/policy/softwarepatents.html "wikilink")
on software patents passed in at their party conference in October 2003.
This is a very well-worded motion, with maybe one minor wording problem
on \"industrial\" application. It specifically calls LDYS to sign the
FFII petition, and on [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") to vote with party policy.
