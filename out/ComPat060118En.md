*20 January 2006 (Brussels) EU Commissioner Charlie Mc Creevy has
announced the start of a drive to create a \"Community Patent\", which
would establish the EPO as the arbitrer of patents in Europe.*

Superficially sold as a package to reduce patenting costs, the Community
Patent risks effectively removing national judges from patent litigation
and impose EPO rulings as final law.

Regarding the need for new \"harmonisation\" of the EU patent system,
veteran campaigner Erik Josefsson of the FFII says, \"The difference
between the EPO-patent and the EU-patent is very small. All EU countries
already have identical patent laws (national implementations of EPC).\"
Further, he points out that the main winners of a new \"harmonised\"
patent system, with English as the proposed dominant language, would be
large multinationals who have tens of thousands of patents (including
software patents) pending translation.

The Community Patent would open the door to huge numbers of weak
patents. Pieter Hintjens, president of the FFII, points out: \"the EU
above all needs a technology sector that is free from the ruinously
expensive litigation that is strangling the US hi-tech industry. While
the cost of obtaining an EU patent is high, the cost of defending
against junk patents is much higher. It is junk patents, software
patents, and business process patents, backed by EPO \'judges\', that
form a real and present danger to the EU hi-tech industry.\"

In remarks made last week, a senior UK judge, Judge Jacob, said that the
scenario in which the same EPO burocrats would issue patents and also
sit as judge and jury on patent litigation would be a disaster for the
EU.

Pieter Hintjens concludes: \"even as the US is fighting off the scourge
of junk patents, the EU Commission and EPO have been leading the race to
the bottom, granting large numbers of weak patents, and especially,
software and business process patents.
[McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink")\'s \'community patent\' does not solve
the software patent problems at the EPO. Rather, it makes them worse.\"

The EU Commission has proposed a 10-week \"consultation period\" in
which businesses are encouraged to provide their opinions on the
suggested harmonisation. Deadline for submissions is 31 March 2006.
