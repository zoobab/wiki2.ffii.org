## Physics of Abstraction (abstraction physics) {#physics_of_abstraction_abstraction_physics}

Abstraction enters the picture of computing with the representation of
physical transistor switch positions of ON \'1\' and OFF \'0\' or what
we call \"Binary\" notation. However, computers have far more transistor
switches in them than we can keep up with in such a low level or first
order abstract manner, so we create higher level abstractions in order
to increase our productivity in programming computers. From Machine
language to application interfaces that allow users to define some
sequence of action into a word or button press (ie. record and playback
macro) so to automate a task, we are working with abstractions that
ultimately accesses the hardware transistor switches which in turn
output to, or control some physical world hardware.

Programming is the act of automating some level of complexity, usually
made up of simpler complexities, but done so in order to allow the user
to use and reuse the complexity through a simplified interface. And this
is a recursive act, building upon abstractions others have created that
even our own created abstractions/automations might be used by another
to further create more complex automations. In general, if we didn\'t
build upon what those before us have done, we then would not advance at
all, but rather be like any other mammal incapable of anything more
than, at best, first level abstraction. But we are more, and as such
have the natural human right and duty to advance in such a manner.

There is an identifiable and definable \"physics of abstraction\"
(abstraction physics), an identification of what is required in order to
make and use abstractions. Abstraction Physics is not exclusive to
computing but constantly in use by \... well\... us humans. Elements or
facets of abstraction physics include the actions of abstraction
creation and use, such as defining a word to mean a more complex
definition (word = definition, function-name = actions to take, etc.),
Starting and Stopping (interfacing with) of an abstraction definition
sequence, keeping track of where you are in the progress of abstraction
sequence usage (moving from one abstraction to another), defining and
changing \"input from\" direction, defining and changing \"output to\"
direction, getting input to process (using variables or place holders to
carry values), sequencially stepping thru abstraction/automation details
(inherently includes optionally sending output), looking up the meaning
of a word or symbol (abstraction) so to act upon or with it, identifing
an abstraction or real item value so to act upon it, and putting
constraints upon your abstraction lookups and identifications (when you
look up a word in a dictionary you don\'t start at the beginning of the
dictionary, but begin with the section that starts with the first letter
then followed by the second, etc., and when you open a box with many
items to stock, you identify each so as to know where to put it in
stock.)

Abstraction Physics has yet to be established/recognized in a broad
\"common acceptance\" manner, similiar to the difficulty in the
acceptance of the hindu-arabic decimal system (which included the
concept that nothing can have value - re: the Zero place holder). It
took three hundred years (from inception) for the innovation of the now
common decimal system to overcome the far more limited Roman Numeral
system. (NOTE: mathmatics and the symbol sets used are also abstractions
and therefor a subset of abstraction possibilities and certainly an
application of abstraction physics.) Though the act of programming is
still younger than many who apply it, we are technologically moving at a
much faster rate of incorporating innovations and better understandings
of reality. There is a physics to abstraction creation and use which can
be used to model and create a non-patentable user friendly general use,
and dynamic, automation (abstraction creation and usage) tool, that also
allows for organized placement and access of abstractions in a logical
or mapable and navigateable manner (not unlike reference books we have
today, from dictionaries, thesaurus, quick reference books to catalogs
of parts, products, etc..)

Nature likes three (3) in primaries, as color in light (additive - red,
blue, green) and paint (subtractive - blue, yellow, red) from which we
can create all other colors in the rainbow. This applies to abstraction
physics as well, as there are three primary user interfaces. The command
line, the Graphical User interface (GUI) and the side door port to
application and functionality access (known by many different names and
application levels such as API, IPC, dcom, dcop, D-bus, plumber, etc.,
but each having its limitation and typically not so end user friendly).
And Like the primary colors, if you take one away or limit its use, you
constrain the ability of the user in putting new automations together or
modifying existing ones. Causing false limitations in user ability also
applies to the abstraction actions mentioned above, constrain access and
you constrain users ability to create or modify.

When abstraction physics becomes better accepted, it will be much more
obvious (an anti-patent facet) that most software is of such qualities
(natural law, physical phenomenon, abstract ideas, algorythims, etc.) to
NOT qualify for patentability. Currently patent granting organizations
have no solid reference point of \"abstraction physics\" from which to
test software patent applications against, or re-evaluate granted
software patents.

The hindu-arabic decimal system enabled much more of the general
population to apply mathmatics in a more powerful \* manner than the
roman numeral system allowed. Likewise, with the establishment and
application of abstraction physics as common knowledge (as the decimal
system is today, even taught in primary school) software will become
genuinely free simply because it will be easy enough to create that the
general population will be able to create it, or cause the machine to
(recursive automation nature of programming), regardless of the resource
limitations of the general population user regarding complexity details.
Otherwise the act of programming becomes falsely constrained, as the
acceptance of the decimal system, and its benefits, was constrained
(perhaps by the roman numeral accountant elites protecting their vested
interest.)

(\*) Worth noting: The Roman Numeral system and its mathmatical
limitation would not have allowed us to develope such a level of math
complexity required for us to create/invent much of what we have today,
including computers. Yet at the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic Decimal
system, such potential creations/inventions were not even imagined.
Perhaps the same inability to see where the acceptance and open (free)
application of \"abstraction physics\" will indeed lead us in time, is a
natural human constraint that only helps to support false constraints of
\"software patents\". With certainty, to see how abstraction physics
would allow, or cause, a genuine new level of economic competition and
products to emerge, where (like as hind-sight) the idea of software
patents would be considered anti-economic, just as the idea of
constraining the use of the hindu-arabic decimal system to only those
who can afford to pay royalities or adhear to some political position,
etc., would today be laughed at in many ways including economically.
