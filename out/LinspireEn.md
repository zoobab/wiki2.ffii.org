## Synposis

Linspire Inc was formerly called Lindows.

However, under pressure of lawsuits and in return for a sum of 20 mn USD
from Microsoft, they ceded the \"Lindows\" trademark and changed their
name to \"Linspire\".

Linspire continues to be active at the forefront of competition with
Microsoft\'s business: in the desktop computing market. They therefore
also expect to be at the forefront of further legal pressure from
Microsoft, this time based mainly on patents.
