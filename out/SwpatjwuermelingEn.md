## Wuermeling speech of 2003-09-23 {#wuermeling_speech_of_2003_09_23}

The original language(german) transcript of his last speech on September
23 in the Plenary is found via the [ german version of this wiki
page](SwpatjwuermelingDe "wikilink").

The Daily Notebook from 2003-09-23 of the
[EuroParl](EuroParl "wikilink") has a
[summary](http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+DN-20030923-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&L=EN&LEVEL=2&NAV=X&LSTDOC=N#SECTION1 "wikilink")
of his last speech:

\" Joachim **WUERMELING** (D), for the EPP-ED group, broadly supported
the [ rapporteur](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink"), and he alluded to the
technical and legal difficulties surrounding the issue. He regretted the
sometimes personal and irrational lobbying that had taken place. His
groups\' aim was to ensure all business, including
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"), could benefit from the legislation. He was also
particularly concerned that the directive would properly protect the
open-source community including Linux. His group, he stated, was against
any patenting of actual software. \"

This is of course a highly deceptive discourse. The talk about the
open-source community and small businesses is not backed up by any real
measures. The talk about \"not patenting actual software\" means simply
that Wuermeling supports \"only\" broad claims which cover an infinite
number of independent software creations, not narrow claims that just
cover one software creation (which is anyway covered by copyright more
effectively than it would be by patents). See
