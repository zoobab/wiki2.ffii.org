*Vrijschrift* FFII.nl letter on the community patent to the chairman of

Dear mister Hofstra,

The community patent is meant to make patents cheaper and more
accessible, and to reach European uniformity. Exploration of the text
[(1)](http://wiki.ffii.org/ComPatEn "wikilink") shows the operation is
not neutral. The community patent will introduce retroactive liability
and so make legal extortion profitable. It will not be possible to
appeal against EPO decisions at an independent court, a violation of the
European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, EPO\'s practice will
be the community patent\'s basis, including its objected practice of
granting software patents.

In the Netherlands, a violator of a patent becomes liable to damages
after being informed he violates a patent. He then has a month to stop
the violation. This checks abuse. For instance with software we see that
many patents are granted for inventions that produce no or hardly any
technical contribution and often are not even new (Advisory Committee on
Software Patents). \"Independent (re)discovery\" and unintentional
violation occur often. Retroactive liability would stimulate abuse and
extortion. A patent owner could wait and send out notices after a long
time. The accused has to pay or go to court, the latter being very
expensive. Too expensive often for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"). To settle
will be the only solution, even if the invention is not a real one. The
Dutch system saveguards [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") to some extend from
extortion. Countries like France, Germany and Engeland employ, with
differences, the system of damages after being informed about the
patent. We should not give up this quality.

Yet, the proposal does change this. Damages will have to be paid in
retrospect, dating back to to the patent\'s applications\'s publication
(art 11). The community patent will make it profitable to apply for
broad, vague and trivial patents, and then send out notices after some
years. !SMEs will have to pay. The community patent will make legal
extortion profitable. This is a turning point we have to steer clear of.

Time limitation on damages will be 10 years, or 5 years in case the
owner had knowledge or should have had knowledge of the infringement
(art 45). This resembles the US system, but with a longer retroactive
period (US: 6 years). Following the US on this point would be bad
policy, surpassing the US is totally irresponsible. Ironically, abuse
and extortion led to a call for reform in the US, while Europe is in
danger of going much to far on this point. In comparison with the Dutch
system, the proposal is detrimental for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"). This
change should be rejected.

No appeal against EPO decisions at an independent court will be
possible. This is a violation of the European Convention on Human
Rights. This situation already exists with the European Patent. An
expansion of this crying abuse to the Community Patent is unacceptable.
The trias politica is the basis of our constitutional state. This
principle did not reach the European patent system. The proposed EPO
reform is insufficient
[(2)](http://wiki.ffii.org/EPOreformEn "wikilink") for that matter.

Judges for the Community Patent Court, the court handling infringement
cases, will be appointed for a fixed term. It is unclear how long this
term will be and whether judges can be reappointed. Reappointing judges
does not lead to independent jurisdiction.

The EPO is an executive organisation that has an interest in granting as
many patents as possible, and has been its own magistrate and made its
own rules for over 30 years. An attempt to codify the objected practice
with regards to software patents was forcefully rejected by the European
Parliament last July. According to the proposal, this practice will be
the basis for the community patent. This uncontrolled case law, together
with cheaper and easier application and long retroactive period is a
pernicious combination. A extra legal burden for [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink")
should be avoided.

At the moment the community patent is stuck on the language problem,
providing time to adapt the proposal. Since unanimity is needed in the
European Council, the Netherlands can exact changes by rejecting the
present text. The state secretary has claimed she wants to raise the
standard of EPO\'s granting practice. The community patent offers an
exquisite opportunity.

Yours truly, On behalf of Vrijschrift / FFII,
