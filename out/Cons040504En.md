## Current Developments {#current_developments}

In secret negotiations, whose minutes are inaccessible to any elected
legislator, be it in the European Parliament or in national parliaments,
patent officials from the European Commission and national patent
administrations (patent offices) are pushing to align the Commission and
Council on the collection of the most extreme patent-fetishist
positions, including direct claimability of computer programs and
process descriptions and unfettered enforcement of patents against
communication standards.

In a meeting of 2004/04/28 within the Commission it seemed that DG
Infosoc (Liikanen) has given up resistance against program claims, thus
relinquishing its only achievement from the negotiations of 2001. If DG
Infosoc upheld its resistance and gained allies within the European
Commission (which is not difficult in the current climate), the decision
would have to be reached by unanimity. This would probably mean
postponement to the next presidency, which may not be as submissive to
corporate lobbies as the Irish one.

At a meeting of 2004/05/03 in the European Patent Office, Gert Kolle,
chief diplomat of the EPO, explained that he expected a decision on
wednesday 2004-05-05. Indeed other sources are also expected at another
coreper meeting tomorrow, 2004-05-05. However similar expectations had
proven wrong at some previous occasions (starting from the Base Proposal
of 2000/06, which the EPO also assumed would pass without problems).

If a decision is taken, the issue will be treated as an A-item, i.e.
nodded off by the ministers without even a formal discussion on May
17/18.

The new member states still do not have a say. They will be allowed to
participate in the voting only in november. However Slovakia has already
expressed opposition and some others are expected to do so too. This is
one reason for some people in Council and Commission to further rush the
procedure.
