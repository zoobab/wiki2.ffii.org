*Warsaw, 18 February 2005 \-- Minister of Science and Technology Michal
Kleiber and Undersecretary of State Wlodzimierz Marcinski held a press
conference about the new laws approved by Sejm (parliament) and about
the informatisation of self-government. Minister Kleiber was asked about
the state of software patents directive and government\'s vision for its
future.*

Minister Michal **Kleiber** said that Europe needs a well drafted and
widely supported directive. Reasonable discussion needs time and
appropriate procedural frame. Poland welcomes and supports motion for
restart unanimously approved by Conference of Presidents of European
Parliament. This motion and several similar requests from parliaments of
several european countries prove that Poland is no longer alone in its
believe that issue of software patents should be regulated in more clear
and precise way. Poland is happy that other countries replaced her as a
requestor for delay in Council final decision. If there will be a motion
for restart of political debate in Council Poland will be happy to
second it./
