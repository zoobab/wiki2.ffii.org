------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was kewl! Because of the many road works on the way from Riga to
Tallinn, the speakers arrived nearly one hour later than expected.
Fortunately, the audience was very patient and there were about 150
people waiting for [Dr. Richard
Stallman](http://stallman.org "wikilink")
([FSF](http://fsf.org "wikilink")), Marco Schulze ([FFII
Germany](http://ffii.org "wikilink") & CEO of a [German
SME](http://www.NightLabs.de "wikilink")) and Christian Engström ([FFII
Sweden](http://ffii.se "wikilink")).

### 1st speech - Dr. Stallman: How Software Patents Hamper Software Development {#st_speech___dr._stallman_how_software_patents_hamper_software_development}

RMS explained in a funny and easy to understand way how harmful software
patents are. He [quoted the
Economist](http://gibuskro.lautre.net/patents/slide13-0.html "wikilink")
and compared the patent system to a lottery. This way he made the
argumentation of patent proponents understandable as these people
publish the same kind of advertisement for software patents as it is
done for a lottery: Highlighting the unlike advantages while hiding the
very probable disadvantages - in regard to software patents more
*catastrophes* than just *disadvantages*.

### 2nd speech - Marco Schulze: Economic Effects Of Software Patents {#nd_speech___marco_schulze_economic_effects_of_software_patents}

Unfortunately, time was very short, because the speakers had to get the
last flight to Helsinki. Thus, Mr. Schulze dropped his speech and added
only some remarks on the speech of Mr. Engström.

His presentation about the bad impact of software patents onto economy
is available here:

### 3rd speech - Christian Engström: What is going on in Brussels and what is FFII doing {#rd_speech___christian_engström_what_is_going_on_in_brussels_and_what_is_ffii_doing}

Because of the short time, Mr. Engström could not set up his notebook
for the presentation. Thus, the white board was used and he explained
how legislation in Brussels works and where the directive about software
patentibility is currently standing. Mr. Schulze added that it was not
yet too late to change the Council\'s decision, because May 18th was
only a pre-decision (the final one is expected at the end of September).
Both emphasized how easy it is to get politically active, because 1st
most [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") are very open for input from their
constituents and 2nd the people on the
[FFII](http://www.ffii.org "wikilink") mailing lists are helping to get
the first steps done.
