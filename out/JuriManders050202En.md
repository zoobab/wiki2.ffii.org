Manders 1st speech in JURI 2005-02-02

Thank you mr chairman, mr [McCreevy](McCreevy "wikilink"), for giving me
the word. I\'d like to address 2 things: first of all you would
investigate what legislation we need, also the implementation, I would
request you also look at the **implementation** per participating
country, since I think there are very big differences there.

Then i\'d like to go further with the points already addressed by
collegue Rocard and mister Lehne. It already follows from the
translation (that\'s why I\'m doing it in Dutch): we keep talking about
\`software-patentability\', but actually that\'s what it\'s specifically
not about. It\'s about \`computer-implemented inventions\', hence the
\`CII-directive\'. The whole discussion has in my opinion been totally
poisoned by false arguments, unfair arguments, and knowingly and
willingly misleading collegues. So now there are clearly 2 camps,
\`for\' and \`against\'. I think ou will run an enormous risk, if the
proposal is voted off now, that a total brain-drain to China and the VS
will arise in industry, which can never have been te intentions of the
Lisbon-targets. Therefore I want to request, or ask your opinion on the
approach, to insert a breathing pause by revoking the proposal, and
introducing a proposal where the Europe-wide patent
(gemeenschapsoctrooi) system is entirely revised. Indeed in that time
with Andre de Pallazzo (?) i have ..

(cut off) (switch to interpreter, much noise)

\...proposal to get an \[?\] suggesting we have just one language. We
then have a proposal for five or six languages which was supported by
members \[?\], we ?? this proposal suggesting english be the language.
Everybody will agree now that 20 languages is simply impossible to
manage. Not in the whole world let alone in Europe. EPO in Munich should
also be fully integrated into the European Union should that
`<noise>`{=html} \[supported?\]. EPO has now announced that most of its
members are also members of the European Union which would mean that
they\'d go along with this proposal. This enables them to have an
effective European Patent office. It includes EPO, it includes as well
the patentability of software and that enables us to better complying
with the Lisbon objectives now that i think about that quick legislation
is something we should have to find out how to get. Thank you.

\[Chairman\] thank you very much, now please deputy Lichtenberger.

Later Mr. Manders gets the word again:

Thank you Chairman,

I\'d like to note that we also need a Europe-wide patent
(gemeenschapsoctrooi). While we\'re doing an impact-assesment anyway, we
should look at that, too, to have a complete European community patent
system, including this directive, since they are related.

Nobody wants patents on software, and that\'s what will happen, so we
have to insulate and specify where we do and where we do not want that,
everyone agrees on that.

But I think, as has been said multiple time, even by collegue
Marssenbroek and the Commisioner, that it\'s very much needed to have a
European community patent as fast as possible. EPO has announced that
they want to cooperate on that.

So maybe that can be included in the impact-assessment, and the
commission can come with a totally new, complete package. Mr. Bolkestein
didn\'t succeed there, languages where a problem, but I think now the
time is ripe and people sufficiently see that it isn\'t practical to
have a European Patent in 21 languages. Then we can address 2 points in
one go, and I think we could then all support it.
