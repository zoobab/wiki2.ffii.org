A long debate in the House of Commons on the Patents Bill (on
facilitation of patent enforcement).

It\'s clear that the [ Patent Defence
Union](PatentDefenceUnionEn "wikilink") seems to have got its message
over quite successfully. Many !MPs now favor legislation that would
subsidise aggressive patent enforcement strategies such as those of PDU
founder Mitchell of [ Allvoice](SwxaiAllvoiceEn "wikilink"). Similar
legislation was proposed by [ Arlene
[McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")](SwpatamccarthyEn "wikilink") in summer
of 2003 in an attempt to sway opposition by the !MEPs to her pro-patent
course and appear more SME-friendly.

Even in the [new improved
presentation](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2004-06-07.39.0 "wikilink"),
it\'s a pretty lengthy read, for not an awful lot of enlightenment, but
quite revealing for some of the broader views taken by !MPs on patents
(or rather: by the handful of interested !MPs).

[ David Taylor](DavidTaylorEn "wikilink") made quite an [effective
intervention against
swpat](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-06-07.52.0 "wikilink")
although the minister dismissed it with the [usual patent propaganda
text
chunk](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-06-07.69.1 "wikilink")
(claiming that software patents have been granted for many decades and
the proposed EU directive [ only harmonises the status
quo](Intro040608En "wikilink")).

Taylor\'s move is characteristic of worries that a number of backbench
!MPs have about the Government\'s wholesale backing for the Directive.
