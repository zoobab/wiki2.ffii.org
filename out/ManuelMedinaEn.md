*Manuel Medina is a member of the European Parliament for the Socialist
Group (PSOE) during this and the last term. In 2003, Medina was said to
be leaning toward the pro-patent side, but during the vote he basically
followed the compromise line of the Spanish socialists, supporting many
cosmetic and some substantial amendments. Recently, Medina has, in a
news paper article, claimed that software patents have fostered
innovation in the USA and that the EPO practice is very conservative.
Later, in amendments which he tabled for PSOE, he again clearly moved
against software patentability.*
