    server because the other one\'s mainboard is just broken (giving
    APIC errors, locking sometimes - generally not stable). I wanted to
    have this server online together with raidbox but somehow this
    didn\'t work out correctly. Anyway, the current server is the
    definite one to which we are going to move services. It would be
    nice if the old server will also be online so we can copy
    everything, but I\'m not sure when that happens.
