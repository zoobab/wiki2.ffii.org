*Apparently a Microsoft frontend similar to CompTIA. ACT activists from
the USA regularly appear at meetings in Brussels to present themselves
as CEO of some SME and ask for software patents or other policies which
are in line with Microsoft\'s current campaigns and which are claimed to
be conformant to competition principles such as \"let the market choose
the winners and losers\". As with CompTIA, the main thrust of ACT seems
to be to use these principles as a basis to argue against state efforts
to curb anti-competitive practises of Microsoft, who is among the
members (we do not know how much of the fees they pay).*
