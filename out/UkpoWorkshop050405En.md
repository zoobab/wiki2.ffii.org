------------------------------------------------------------------------

*5 April 2005 \-- The UK Patent Office is organising workshops to have
people evaluate various definitions for the term \"technical
contribution\". Below, you can find a report from someone attending the
workshop in Glasgow.*

## Report

by Geraint Bevan.

### Introduction

The meeting was chaired by Roger Walker, a chemist/bio-technologist of
the Patent Office. Peter Hayward of the Patent Office was also present
along with a couple of assistants. Attendance was poor \-- 16 people,
which appeared to be just over half of those expected.

As with previous workshops, there was roughly a 50:50 split between pro
and anti software patent people. 550 people in total have expressed an
interest in attending the workshops around the UK \-- all were invited.
We were assured that there were no secret patent office staff among the
attendees!

Roger Walker introduced the workshop, saying that the government\'s aims
were to maintain the current balance: pure software is not patentable;
computer-implemented inventions are. The government is keen to encourage
European high-tech industry \-- Nokia was mentioned as an example.

We were told that there is currently no definition of \"technical
contribution\", it has arisen as a result of jurisprudence.

As with previous workshops, we were given 4 definitions of \"technical
contribution\", against which we were to assess 5 case studies,
hypothetical inventions which we were to assume were novel and
non-obvious. We were divided into 4 tables for this exercise and invited
to decide whether or not the cases were patentable under each
definition. We were urged to try to reach a consensus, but it was not
essential.

### Cases

The hypothetical inventions were:

-   Case 1: Control of traffic lights to optimise traffic flow.
-   Case 8: Centralised printing services (including billing) for a
    hotel
-   Case 12: A method for predicting moves in an online game
-   Case 13: A method of allocating cell-phone bandwidth according to
    demand
-   Case 18: Data structure to improve the efficiency of spreadsheet
    recalculation

The definitions were the current council text, the FFII text and two
definitions drawn from a pool of twenty selected from over 200
suggestions.

### Definitions

#### Definition A (council text) {#definition_a_council_text}

`"Technical Contribution" means a contribution to the state of the art`\
` in a field of technology which is new and not obvious to a person`\
` skilled in the art. The technical contribution shall be assessed by`\
` consideration of the state of the art and the scope of the patent`\
` claim considered as a whole, which must comprise technical features,`\
` irrespective of whether or not these are accompanied by non-technical`\
` features.`

#### Definition B (FFII text) {#definition_b_ffii_text}

`"Technical Contribution" means a contribution made by a claimed`\
` invention, considered as a whole, to the state of the art in a field`\
` of technology. "Technical" means belonging to a field of technology.`

` New teaching about the use of controllable forces of nature under the`\
` control of a computer program, beyond the implementation of the data`\
` processing itself, is technical. The processing, handling,`\
` representation and presentation of information by a computer program`\
` is not technical, even where technical devices are employed for such`\
` purposes.`

#### Definition F {#definition_f}

`"A technical contribution should make a substantial, non-obvious`\
` advance to the state of the art of knowledge in a technical field, and`\
` should not be representable as pure logic."`

#### Definition H {#definition_h}

`"A technical contribution is an addition to the general understanding`\
` of, or art of, the technological control of physical processes. A`\
` technical contribution may be expressed in computer software of other`\
` kind of algorithm, but it is not 'technical' simply by virtue of being`\
` thus expressed."`

### General results {#general_results}

For many combinations of case and definition, a consensus was not
reached by each table. After an hour, votes for the patentability or
non-patentability of each permutation were recorded. The overall summary
of the results was that:

-   Definition A led to many question marks, i.e. a decision about the
    patentability or otherwise of a case could not be made;
-   definition B gave fairly consistent results across the groups;
-   definition F was fairly inconsistent;
-   definition H was fairly consistent except for case 8.

The general trends were that definition A tended to make everything
patentable; B tended to make everything non-patentable; F and H were
mixed but with a tendency towards non-patentability.

### Results at my table (4) {#results_at_my_table_4}

\|\| Case \|\| A \|\| B \|\| F \|\| H \|\| Subject \|\| \|\| #1 \|\|
NNN? \|\| NNNN \|\| YYYN \|\| YYYY \|\| Traffic light control \|\| \|\|
#8 \|\| YNN? \|\| NNNN \|\| YYNN \|\| NNNN \|\| Hotel print service \|\|
\|\| #12 \|\| YNN? \|\| YNNN \|\| NNNN \|\| YNNN \|\| Online game

\|\| NNNN \|\| Spreadsheet data structure \|\|

-   Y: Case is patentable using the definition
-   N: Case is not patentable using the definition
-   ?: The definition cannot decide the patentability of the case

### Comments (by table) {#comments_by_table}

Each table then gave comments about how easy they found the definitions
to apply and which they preferred.

Table 1 was split with some preferring definition A and some preferring
B. Those who liked A welcomed the fact that it allowed pretty much
anything to be patented. As one patent lawyer said, he liked it because
it lets stuff through the technical barrier leaving assessment to the
novel and non-obviousness tests. Those who preferred B liked the fact
that it did not make everything patentable. This table commented that
they didn\'t like the phrase \"pure logic\" in definition F.

Table 2 had a couple of people who preferred definition A. They didn\'t
like the other definitions because they led to arguments over
interpretation.

Table 4 (mine) were unhappy with all of the definitions. We found A to
be a circular definition which was not capable of defining anything
unless the phrases \"technical features\" and \"field of technology\"
were also defined. We were unanimous in reluctantly preferring B as the
best of a bad bunch.

Table 5 also found A to be circular, noting that it restricted nothing
and was the closest to the European position. For definition B, they
questioned whether \"a field of technology\" restricted inventions to a
single field or allowed inventions to cross several fields. Peter
Hayward assured them that from a legal perspective, \"a field\" would
allow inventions to cross several fields.

They also questioned precisely what intermediate steps would be
permitted in the control of forces of nature. The phrase \"forces of
nature\" was generally liked and understood to relate to physical
things. There was some unhappiness with definition F because it would go
beyond the scope of the directive and also exclude pure mathematics (!!!
there were patent lawyers there !!!). They thought that H gave the
widest possible definition.

### Voting

We were then asked whether or not we thought that each of the cases
should be patentable, regardless of definition.

-   Case 1: 11 patentable, 5 non-patentable
-   Case 8: 3 patentable, 13 non-patentable
-   Case 12: 5 patentable, 11 non-patentable
-   Case 13: 15 patentable, 1 non-patentable
-   Case 18: 6 patentable, 10 non-patentable

We were also asked whether or not we thought pure software should be
patentable

-   Pure software: 7 patentable, 6 non-patentable

A straw poll, after some people had left, was also held to ascertain
whether we believed that the current directive achieves the
government\'s stated aims:

-   7 no, it doesn\'t; 0 yes, it does; 2 abstentions

### What next? {#what_next}

The outcomes of each workshop will be collated and presented to Lord
Sainsbury along with the Patent Office\'s recommendations after the
final sessions on Friday. All of the definitions and case studies will
then be published on a web site. The outcome of the sessions will also
be made available, but not until the minister has had a chance to see
them. It was noted that the general election may prevent disclosure for
a while.

The raw data from which the collated results are obtained will probably
not be published on a web site because they would not make much sense to
people who did not attend the workshops, but we were assured that they
would be available to those who desired to see them to check that the
reported outcomes are justified by the data.

### Further comments {#further_comments}

After further discussions with the Patent Office staff, there were two
comments that are worthy of particular note. Firstly, the UK government
delegates decisions on UK patent policy to the patent office, i.e. it is
not the case that the patent office merely implements the government\'s
wishes; it also decides what those wishes are.

*Editor\'s note:* Peter Hayward from the UKPO, who is UKPO staff member
referred to above, provided the following clarification regarding what
he said:

`"What I explained at Glasgow was that in some European countries policy`\
` on intellectual property is handled by officials in Justice Departments`\
` and in others (including the UK) it is handled by officials in Patent`\
` Offices.  That does not mean that Patent Office officials like myself`\
` decide policy, any more than officials in Justice Departments decide`\
` policy.  Policy is decided by Ministers, as Steve Probert has already`\
` rightly stressed.`

` Just to be complete, I suppose I should have mentioned that in yet`\
` other countries the policy is handled by officials in general Trade`\
` Departments.  There are pros and cons of all the options."`

Secondly, when discussing the impact of software patents on open-source
software, we were told that many leading open-source developers did not
think that there would be any adverse impact, including people from
FFII. Unfortunately, Peter Hayward would not tell us which leading open
source developer in FFII made such comments. This matter should
certainly be pursued as it is quite likely that comments taken out of
context are being used to misrepresent FFII opinion (perhaps
unintentionally).
