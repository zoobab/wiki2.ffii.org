------------------------------------------------------------------------

In early november, the UK government - Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) - invited those concerned citizens who, by writing letters to
their members of Parliament, questioned the government\'s policy on
software patents and on the planned EU directive. A row erupted before
the meeting, because leading critics had not been invited. At the
meeting, most of the time was used for allowing the UK Patent Office
people to present their case. Yet, according to some reports, the
backers of the European Parliament\'s Counter-Proposal were able promote
their case fairly well. It became evident that the Council\'s version
lacks clarity and does not exclude from patentability the types of
patents which the UKPO officials professed they wanted to exclude.
