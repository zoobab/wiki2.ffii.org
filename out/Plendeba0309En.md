The Real stream is no longer available from EbS, the string \" (Click on
Tuesday, go to 9am-10am, and click on 09h43\'58\'\' on the left))\" can
be removed, there is no such link anymore.

EbS has no archive server yet. It would be a good thing to ask the
European Ombudsman to propose such archive, provided in an open way
which can be played on Macintosh and Linux platforms as well.
