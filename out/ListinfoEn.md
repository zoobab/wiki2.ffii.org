    Lists](http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo "wikilink")

## How to Subscribe {#how_to_subscribe}

There are two and a half ways to subscribe to a List:

-   Log into our participation system at
    <https://www.ffii.org/ffii-cgi/aktiv>
    -   -   For mailing lists with no associated project, choose
            \"Subscribe to Mailing Lists\". The remaining steps should
            be self-explanatory \....
        -   Most mailing lists (almost all ending with -news, -parl,
            -help, -resp) are associated with a project, so you choose
            \"Project participation\" and select which level of
            participation you want. Normal discussion lists (-parl) are
            \"I want to participate in discussions\".

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Go to <http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/> and choose your
    list, then follow the instructions to subscribe. Don\'t be irritated
    by the fact that it reads *![description available](no "wikilink")*
    for most lists - you **will** find Information once you click on the
    list name.

**Attention**: If you have subscribed via the participation system, you
**must** use it to unsubscribe. Else you will found yourself
resubscribed the next day.

## How to unsubscribe {#how_to_unsubscribe}

Unsubscribing is sometimes the harder part. This is not intended - some
things in our Mailman system are simply broken, and nobody has so far
had time to fix them. Please have some patience and follow the
instructions below.

### If you subscribed via the participation System\... {#if_you_subscribed_via_the_participation_system...}

\... log into the participation system at
<http://www.ffii.org/ffii-cgi/aktiv?lg=en> and cancel your subscription
there. Note: Due to a small bug, your subscription status will probably
read \"not subscribed\" for all lists even if you are subscribed.
However, you can unsubscribe this way.

Many language lists part of your participation in projects (see
\"Project participation\" in aktiv), so you have to change your
participation level to get unsubscribed.

It is **not** sufficient to unsubscribe via the Mailman interface - you
will find yourself back on the list the next day. (see below to find the
reason why)

More detailed instructions in German can be found
[here](http://hoehue.de/ffiiaustragen/ "wikilink") or [
here](MailmanUnsubDe "wikilink").

### If you subscribed via the Mailman interface \... {#if_you_subscribed_via_the_mailman_interface_...}

The unsubscribe function is a bit hard to find for those not familiar
with Mailman. To unsubscribe, follow these steps:

1.  Go to <http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/> .
2.  Choose your list. (Read the text at the top of the page carefully if
    your list is not mentioned on this page!)
3.  Enter your mail address on the bottom of the page.
4.  Have your list Password mailed to your Mail account. It will usually
    arrive within a few minutes.
5.  Use that password to unsubscribe from the list (upper left of the
    page).

You might get a server error after you unsubscribed. Usually, this is
meaningless, and the unsubscription succeeded anyway. Just watch your
inbox for the confimation mail.

Easy, isn\'t it?

You can also send a mail to
\*`<listname>`{=html}-\*\*request\*\*\@ffii.org\* from the mail address
you want to unsubscribe, with the subject \"\*unsubscribe\*\". This will
do the job as well and is maybe even easier.

### But Mail from the list starts coming again the next day after I unsubscribed! {#but_mail_from_the_list_starts_coming_again_the_next_day_after_i_unsubscribed}

**Solution:** Log into the participation system at
<http://www.ffii.org/ffii-cgi/aktiv?lg=en> and cancel your subscription
from there, as described above.

In most cases, this happens when you subscribed via the participation
system, but unsubscribed via Mailman only (see above about how to do it
right). Mailman is synchronized with the data from the participation
system every night. If you unsubscribed via Mailman only, but are still
listed as a subscriber in the participation system, you will find
yourself back on the list the next day.

If you subscribed via the participation system and then changed your
address in the wrong way, you might not be able to unsubscribe at all.
In this case, please read the next paragraph:

### Help! I can\`t unsubscribe at all! {#help_i_cant_unsubscribe_at_all}

Try this Workaround:

1.  Go to <http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/> .
2.  Choose your list. (Read the text at the top of the page carefully if
    your list is not mentioned on this page!)
3.  Enter your mail address on the bottom of the page.
4.  Have your list Password mailed to your Mail account. It will usually
    arrive within a few minutes.
5.  Use the password to temporarily disable mail delivery in the menue
    on the lower half of the page.

This is not how it is meant to be, but it will stop mail from coming.

## List Naming System {#list_naming_system}

FFII Mailing Lists typically appear in groups of three, named like this:

-   \"!XX-news\@ffii.org\" is the news list: Announcements only, i.e.
    low traffic, but no way to write.
-   \"!XX-parl\@ffii.org\" is for discussions, i.e. the \"main\" list
-   \"!XX-help\@ffii.org\" is for support

where \"XX\" (usually a countrycode) indicates the subject of the list.

Example: de-news, de-parl and de-help (Country-related:Germany)

-   \"!XX-admin\@ffii.org\" should be forwarded to the list
    administrator.

## Who is in charge? {#who_is_in_charge}

One thing ahead:

**Please do *not* waste our active member\'s time with administrivia
unless you absolutely need to do so!** **In particular, do not send
\"Remove me from this list!\" mail to the list you want to be removed
from.**

### List administrator {#list_administrator}

On the Mailman page for your list, you will find the mail address of
your list administrator on the bottom left. At
<http://plone.ffii.org/Members>, you can search for a name matching the
mail address.

Generally, you can use `<Listenname>`{=html}-!owner\@ffii.org to send
mail to the List administrator.

### Mailman administrators {#mailman_administrators}

Look for the mailman project at <http://www.ffii.org/proj/#mailman> to
find out who is in charge of the mailman system and how you can help.

### Aktiv administrators {#aktiv_administrators}

Look for the AKTIV project at
<http://www.ffii.org/proj/index.en.html#aktiv> to find out who is in
charge and how you can help.

1.  1.  === Last resort
    2.  You can mail to the FFII Heldesk : de-help\@ffii.org
    3.  As always: Please think twice before doing so.
