### Swedish ministry of Justice staff clueless or malicious? {#swedish_ministry_of_justice_staff_clueless_or_malicious}

Voting recomendations \[1\] from Swedish ministry of Justice staff show
either lack of basic knowledge in patent law or unwillingness to
understand core amendments from the cross party compromise tabled by
groups from all over the political spectrum.

The saying \"never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by
incompetence\" is a good rule of thumb, but leaked documents from a
meeting yesterday at the Swedish Permanent Representation in Brussels
where swedish [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") and assistants were invited to
discuss the European Parliament\'s amendments to the Council\'s Software
Patents Directive show either a lack of basic understanding of patent
law, or an attempt to push a pro-software patent agenda with convoluted
and unclear arguments.

The swedish [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") have been lobbied by the swedish
government staff as intensly as by the big industry associations. MEP
Anders Wijkman highlighted the government lobbying on the EPP-hosted
conference \"Claiming Economic Majorities: the Software Patent Case\" on
29 June \[2\]. The swedish government has repeatly made it very clear
they support the Council\'s text.

The core amendments of the the cross-partisan package of 21 amendments
are all unacceptable to the swedish staff. The reasons given are unclear
and contradictory, and shows signs of wilful misinterpretation of the
amendment\'s intentions.

When the EP defines \"a \"field of technology\" is a field of applied
natural science\", the swedish staff argues \"to make it more exact it
would be better to talk about \"applied natural science and engeneering
science\".\" This position is a cousin to EICTA\'s, which says \"exact
science\", and opens up the patent system for any innovation in any
dicipline of \"engineering\".

All amendments that keeps the requirements for patentability separate
(to amend the convoluted EPO doctrines), are accused of putting \"the
conditions into one another\".

Any amendment that implies that data processing solutions (i.e. computer
programs) must be excluded from patentability is rejected. Everywhere an
amendment would imply this, the swedish staff insists on inserting \"as
such\".

Clarifying amendments are accused of \"hair splitting\" while amendments
that makes clear a computer program is data processing solution are
treated like untouchable aliens. Even if the European parliament\'s
definition of a computer is as close as you can get to the standard
industry definition, it is not understood at all by the swedish staff.
Over all, any implication that a computer program is a solution to a
problem is met with haptophobia (\"fear of contact\").

Finally, any university course in Swedish patent law clearly teaches
there are four requirements for patentability: \"For the method to be
patentable it must be 1) an invention 2) that is industrially applicable
3) that is new \[\...\] 4) and meets the inventive step requirement\"
\[3\]. The staff still argues there are only three.
