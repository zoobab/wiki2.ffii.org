The following committees have been involved

-   JURI, very lawyerish, pro-patent and pro big business
-   ITRE, interested in entrepreneurial freedom, freedom of publication
-   CULT, pro-copyright, against use of patents in logical and cultural
    works

The party groups showed trends as follows

-   EPP-DE, conservative, most delegations follow extreme pro-patent
    positions of German shadow-rapporteur Joachim Wuermeling and UK big
    business relay Malcolm Harbour. Austrian OeVP, led by, Otmar Karas
    and Paul Ruebig, under influence chamber of commerce and SME-Union,
    against software patents. Finnish MEP Piia-Noora Kauppi leads group
    of software patent sceptics within EPP-DE, has some followers in
    most countries. This includes some whole national delegations (NL,
    AT, FI, IE). FR, DE, UK (countries of Fourtou, Wuermeling and
    Harbour respectively) have 3\--4 individual dissidants each (out of
    large groups).

-   PSE, socialists, UK block is soldier of big business, most other
    national blocks are receptive to arguments from
    [SMEs](SMEs "wikilink") and civil society, many national groups
    voted wholly or in half against software patents, French socialist
    group has particular merits in achieving these results. French and
    Italian groups also voted against IPR Enforcement directive.

    UK [LibDems](LibDems "wikilink") (against party policy) for. Others
    mostly against. Most ELDR [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") nonetheless
    supported IPRED. Dutch D66 and Swedes are our most reliable allies.
