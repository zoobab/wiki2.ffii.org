The Council of Ministers of the European Union has consistently pledged
an unconditional allegiance to the patent faith and a resolve to
\"promote patent protection\" or, in codewords, \"promote innovation\"
or \"promote entrepreneurship\", all meaning the same, namely promote
the interests of the governmental patent institutions whose anonymized
\"working party\" formulates the Council\'s policies. The lawmaking of
the EU Council on software patents can serve as a textbook example on
the loss of accountability and democracy in the European Union\'s
lawmaking procedures.

## Corrigenda, Addenda {#corrigenda_addenda}

The text of the link [The Register on
Council](http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/33016.html "wikilink") on
the static page could be enhanced to read:

The [Italian Council Presidency\'s press release about the European
Parliament\'s
decision](http://www.ueitalia2003.it/EN/Notizie/competitivita/Notizia_09241845549.htm "wikilink")
consists of pure pro-patent misinformation, concluded by the following
paragraph:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A recent study commissioned by the Intellectual Property Institute,
based in London, concluded that patentability of computer-related
inventions has contributed to an increase in the numbers of industries
linked to computer programmes in the USA, and in particular to an
increase in the numbers of small and medium-sized companies and
independent software creators who have developed into large and
important concerns.*

This study is not recent but an old scam from DG Internal Market from
2000, see <http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/indprop-ipi00/>, written by a
team of well-known software patent lawyers. All the economic evidence
contained in the study points out that software patents are stifling
innovation.
