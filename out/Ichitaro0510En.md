*3rd October 2005 \-\-- The Ichitaro wordprocessing software seems to be
safe from a patent attack by Japanese Electronics giant Matsushita. Five
judges of a newly installed Tokyo High Intellectual Property Court found
that Matsushita\'s patent on the help drag-and-drop function represented
no significant advance over the known art of the early 1990s when it was
filed. In February of this year a lower court had ordered the removal of
the Ichitaro software from the market and destruction of all stocked
disks containing this software, but had stopped short of issuing a
preliminary execution warrant. Thus Ichitaro maker Justsystem K.K., a
main competitor of Microsoft on the wordprocessor market in Japan, seems
to be out of harmsway.*

## More details {#more_details}

Justsystem introduced new prior art into the proceding, pointing in
particular to a system from Hewlett Packard which already contained a
drag and drop help button function in the early nineties when the patent
was filed.

[ Justsystem was condemned to withdraw and destroy its products by Tokyo
district court in February 2005](Ichitaro0502En "wikilink").

The new \"Tokyo Higher Intellectual Property Court\" was installed this
year and the Justsystem appeal against Matsushita was its first case.

Justsystem is a company of 900 employees.

Matsushita, also known under labels like National Panasonic, is for
Japan what GE is for the USA and Siemens for Germany. Matsushita
probably owns more European software patents than both Siemens and GE.
At least they were at the very top of the list of EPO software patents
applicants for several years. The patent under litigation here was
however applied for and granted in Japan only.

### Hartmut Pilch {#hartmut_pilch}

The speed and ease with which the court decided that Justsystems was not
infringing a valid patent claim is quite impressive. At least in Germany
an infringment court would assume the patent to be valid until disproven
by an invalidation procedure in a separate court. In some other European
countries the procedure would be less patentee-friendly than in Germany,
but usually it would take several years. Yet the damage suffered by
Justsystem in terms of lost time, court fees and legal incertainty is
still considerable. Thousands of other software patents are waiting out
there to be used, and many of their claims are less easy to disprove on
grounds of prior art than those of Matsushita help button patent. Also,
most potential victims are far less able to shoulder the burdens than
Justsystem.
