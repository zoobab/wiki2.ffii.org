\"This document summarises the aspects referred to by the Belgian
delegation at the meeting on 29 and 30 October 2001 regarding the EC\'s
accession to the European Patent Convention. The Belgian delegation\'s
contribution was based on a study carried out by Professor Govaere of
the University of Ghent on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
concerning the institutional aspects of the EC\'s accession to the
European Patent Convention.

When examining the impact of the Community\'s exclusive internal and
external competence with regard to Community patents, a distinction
should be drawn between  on the one hand  the effect of the exercise
of the Community\'s competence regarding patents on Member States\'
powers, and  on the other hand  the consequences of the EC\'s
accession to the European Patent Convention for the Member States\'
national legal systems.\"

\"With regard to the European Patent Convention, the Court will
therefore have exclusive competence to interpret the provisions
applicable both to Community patents and to those European patents which
represent a combination of national patents. Provisions which apply
solely to European patents but in respect of which harmonisation exists
at Community level will also fall within the scope of the Court\'s
exclusive competence. In this respect it is essential that the Court\'s
interpretation is binding on the national court which has requested the
preliminary ruling 26 and on all other national courts. 27 The Court\'s
competence to interpret means that it can also rule on the precedence
and direct effect of the European Patent Convention in Member States\'
national legal systems. In future, therefore, the European Patent
Convention, by analogy with the [TRIPs](TRIPs "wikilink") Agreement,
should be subject partly to the EC principles concerning precedence and
direct effect and partly to Member States\' constitutional laws
concerning the effect of international agreements on the national legal
system, depending on whether or not the EC has already legislated
internally with regard to patents. This would imply that all the
provisions of the European Patent Convention which also apply to the
Community patent would in any case be subject to the EC principles
concerning precedence, direct effect and uniform interpretation by the
Court of Justice.\"
