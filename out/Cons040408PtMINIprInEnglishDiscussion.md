Evaluation of the versions from Jonas and Hartmut:

Headline:

# Jonas: EU Democracy Undermined by Council {#jonas_eu_democracy_undermined_by_council}

# Harmut: [MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") and Software Creators Protest against Undermining of EU Democracy by Unelected Legislators {#harmut_meps_and_software_creators_protest_against_undermining_of_eu_democracy_by_unelected_legislators}

Comments on Headline:

-   Jonas:
    -   -   Correct lengh, possible to take as an article headline as
            well
        -   Emphasizes on a Scandal (Scaldals take front pages)
        -   short and sharp, without attacking persons, it\'s the body
            itself which is bad
-   Harmut:
    -   -   too long for use article headline.
        -   raises doubts like \"Who are \'unelected legislators\'?\"

`    * The national ministers in Germany are alos not elected, and they work on legislative texts like the council, so what gives?`

-   -   people protest all the time, there is nothing new it it

Intro paragragraph:

-   Jonas:
    -   -   Interesting 1st sentence which grabs attention,
        -   EU not a democracy
