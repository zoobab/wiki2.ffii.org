------------------------------------------------------------------------

MEPs not only rotate between Brussels where they are most of the time,
and Strasbourg (ca 1 week / month), but they also have home weeks (also
called \"constituency week\", that is they are in their home country and
place) to care for local issues and local persons. Note that the home
weeks are often at a time where there are also national holidays, please
respect that when trying to arrange a meeting. Of course, many
[MEPs](MEPs "wikilink") also are in their home countries on the weekends
or when other circumstances require this. It is also admitted that the
home week concept is less exciting if you happen to live in or near
Brussels or Strasbourg anyway.

Upcoming home weeks:

-   2005-02-07..11
-   2005-03-21..25
-   2005-05-16..20
-   2005-11-01..04

In the [calendar
(pdf)](http://www.europarl.eu.int/plenary/cal2005_en.pdf "wikilink"),
home weeks are in yellow (in case you are interested: the dark-red
plenary session weeks are in Strasbourg, the light-red committee meeting
weeks and blue group meeting weeks mostly in Brussels).
