Arlene [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") was the draftsperson
(/rapporteur/) of the [ software patent directive
proposal](EubsaSwpat0202 "wikilink") and the [
ENISA](EnisaEn_regulation_proposal "wikilink").

She also was the [ PSEshadow](PseEn "wikilink") rapporteur of the IPR
Enforcement proposal and many other proposals in the information society
and [ intellectual propertyarea](IntellectualPropertyEn "wikilink").

Everybody (except one) in the UK Labour group slavishly followed the
same central source of commands, differences within the group do not
lead to an overt split.

As of May 2004, the month before the elections, McCarthy [supports the
parliaments position from 1st
reading](http:Amccarthy040528En "wikilink").

This change is also confirmed by a [mail to a constituent in July
2004](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-uk/2004-07/msg00028.html "wikilink")
from [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") and by [David
Bowe](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-uk/2004-07/msg00040.html "wikilink")
whose statements were following [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") but
suddenly, a letter received just after he lost his seat is commented
with: *It was as though he thought I would have forgotten all his
previous talk* *of unifying the systems across the EU countries, and
instead he was all fired up* *about how the council of ministers went
against the Parliament\'s decision and that* *they (the council of
ministers) would have a very hard time* *trying to get the bill through
without the Parliament\'s amendments.*

Of course, **David Bowe** should be complaining to his own Government
Party (Sainsbury) first.

Phil Hunt comments: *Perhaps, as an MEP, [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink")
is annoyed with the way the CoM has blatently* *ignored the elected
parliament. Perhaps also, this issue is more important* *to her than the
issue of software patents.*

## Anonymous comment from in March 2004 {#anonymous_comment_from_in_march_2004}

McCarthy aggressively pushed the agenda of big business and CEC
Directorate for the Internal Market without caring much about the truth
of what she is saying (or even about what it means). This is well known
in her socialist group and even within her UK Labour group, many of whom
don\'t take Mccarthy seriously. This might also have been a factor of
why she has been selected as the draftsperson of this text, because
being able to put statements without caring much aobut the truth of them
is an essential qualification for pushing a text like the software
patent directive and the IPR Enforcement directive thru parliament in
the way the corporate industry wants it.

SITTING OF TUESDAY, 23 SEPTEMBER 2003

Patentability of computer-implemented inventions

McCarthy (PSE), *rapporteur* . ? Mr President, the Commission proposal
on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions before
Parliament is not, as some opponents of the directive have suggested, a
new phenomenon. Neither does it argue for the patenting of software, nor
for extending the patentability and scope of protection in this area.

The fact is that some 30 000 patents for computer-implemented inventions
have been handed out by the European Patent Office and indeed national
patent offices. Computer-implemented inventions are present, as the
Commissioner has said, in everyday household appliances, from safety
devices such as airbags in cars to mobile phones, washing machines and
an endless list of other devices with relevance going well beyond the
traditional computer industries to the heart of our manufacturing
sectors. Let us be clear: without this directive, patents will continue
to be filed. Out of over 110 000 applications received at the EPO in
2001, 16 000 dealt with inventions in computer-implemented technologies.

In the USA, and increasingly in Japan, patents have unfortunately been
granted for what is essentially pure software. An EU directive, by
setting limits to patentability in this area, could stop the drift in
Europe towards a US-liberal style of patenting software as such, and
indeed of patenting pure business methods.

One oft-quoted example of such a bad patent is Amazon\'s \'one-click\'
shopping method. Clearly this technology is not new, nor is it unique,
and patenting of software business methods such as this is not good for
innovation and competition. It is unfortunate that the EPO has granted
it a patent: this is an example of bad EPO practice.

Without a doubt computer-implemented inventions - genuine inventions
which, in some cases, are the result of 10 to 15 years\' R&D
investment - are important for the European economy. At a time when many
of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East,
we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living.

I have seen letters from small companies across Europe which are
supportive of this directive. A small Belgian company employing 12
people has written to me saying that it needs patents to get a return on
its investment, to grow its business and to ensure that others respect
its technology. It is important for many European companies to grow
their businesses through revenue secured by patents and licences. This
is also the case for a ten-person company in the south-west of England,
located in an economic blackspot with high unemployment. This company
granted a licence to a US multinational for its computer-implemented
voice recognition patents, which shows that in the world of global
patents there can be examples of David meeting Goliath. Without patent
protection the small company could have found itself in a perverse
situation where its R&D efforts would have been free for the
multinational company which, with its team of patent lawyers, would have
gained the patent in this area. Consequently, the European company would
not have reaped the benefits and, indeed, there could have been an
infringement of a patent owned by a multinational.

I have tabled amendments in my report to underline my opposition to the
patenting of software as such. We want explicitly to exclude computer
methods, algorithms and mathematical models from patentability, as set
out in a new Article 4. I have attempted to produce balanced legislation
that takes account of the needs of all sectors of the industry, not just
one vocal sector that is against this directive.

I would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement
of the proposed legislation. I therefore ask the Commission to look at
the crux of this debate: how do we get good patent law which rewards our
most innovative companies for their investment in R&D while, at the same
time, not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant
position, lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition? I
therefore ask the Commissioner to look at these amendments tabled in
plenary today. They are very clear in suggesting that we need to limit
patentability to genuine inventions in Articles 2 and 4. We want to
ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in
reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental
purposes without risking infringement or legal action. It is vital that
we address the perception that patents are only for big business: small
companies can, and do, gain from patent protection. However, to have a
fighting chance in such a competitive business they need access to
affordable patents and assistance with legal fees to protect and enforce
their patents.

Other amendments seek to ensure that the granting of a patent does not
allow monopoly or abuse of a dominant position. We also want to protect
the open-source community which makes a vital contribution to
competitiveness in the area of software development.

Therefore, I ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the
amendments and to recognise them in the spirit in which they have been
tabled, as a genuine attempt to ensure that Europe develops good patent
law in the field of computer-implemented inventions. This does not mean
rubber-stamping bad practice in Europe, but developing good practice for
the future, good law, good patent examiners, and a quick death for
applications that are clearly not inventions. We also want to ensure
that multinationals do not dominate in our EU markets. We need patents
in order to protect our own companies and investments so that they can
be effective global players in this fast-changing and rapidly developing
software-development market.

# Her final remark (Euparl debate 03-09-23) {#her_final_remark_euparl_debate_03_09_23}

McCarthy (PSE) *rapporteur*

`Mr President, I did not want to make this point during my speech, but it is necessary that it should be made.`\
`In the ten years that I have been an MEP I have never encountered such a personal, aggressive and abusive`\
`campaign as I have with this particular directive. I have been bullied and harassed by lobbyists. My staff `\
`have been bullied to the extent that one of them had to take days off with a stress-related illness.`

`I am now asking you, Mr President, to ensure that you conduct the vote tomorrow in an orderly way, to ensure `\
`that Parliament and its Members are permitted to vote as they are empowered to do by their democratic mandate `\
`to draft and make legislation. `

# Arlene [McCarthy](McCarthy "wikilink") about EU politics {#arlene_mccarthy_about_eu_politics}

`Policy formulation should not be the result of`\
`politicians making decisions in a vacuum or in closed smoked-filled rooms.`\
`Nor should it be the domain of civil servants in the Commission, based on a`\
`set of theories or principles or a grand idea that they may develop from`\
`textbooks. We need the input of practitioners. We need the grass-roots`\
`experience of municipalities and regions across Europe to feed into the`\
`political process. As a politician, I would say we cannot bring Europe to`\
`the people unless we have your experience feeding our policy development.`
