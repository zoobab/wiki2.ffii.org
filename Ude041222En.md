## Munich Press Release (translation) {#munich_press_release_translation}

The Munich City Council website
[quotes](http://www.muenchen.de/vip8/prod2/mde/_de/rubriken/Rathaus/40_dir/presse/2004/ru/12/22.pdf "wikilink")
(Rathaus-Umschau page 2) Munich\'s mayor Christian Ude as welcomes the
new development in the Council:

\"(2004-12-22) The possibility of correcting the controversely discussed
proposal on a directive of \"Computer Implemented Inventions\" are
restored. The dutch EU-prsidency has unexpectedly failed to pass the
directive on the agricultural and fishery council without discussion.
The polish delegation, led by the state secretary for information
science, opposed adoption and asked for more time to be able to make a
reasoned statement.

With this change the critics of the directive, by building an impressive
opposition since last friday against the unnecessarily hasty procedures,
can claim another success. Mayor Christian Ude welcomes this
development: \"Thanks to the brave action of the Polish delegation it
has become obvious again that the concerns raised against the draft have
not been fully addressed, and that there is an urgent need to discuss
the directive in the EU-council.\" Ude still sees good chances for
changing the directive from it surrent state: \"A new discussion in the
the competent configuration of the Council could bring about the needed
legal security and clarity.\"

The multi-partisan resolution of the german parliament can now be taken
into the discussion. Ude: \"I would welcome the german government to
take the demands of the resolution to Brussels, as this resolution also
supports the need for clarity and the questions concernig legal effects
that the City of Munich would like to see resolved.\"
