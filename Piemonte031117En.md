We are pleased to present you the convention \"Knowledge as public
common property: software, data, know-how\". Organized by CSI-Piemonte
on 17th-18th November in Turin, the event will be focused on what
obstacles impede broad access to the ever-growing heritage of knowledge
and what strategies can reconcile privacy and security rights and market
pressure for protection of information property (patents, licenses,
copyrights, etc.) with the goal of free access for all to information
and the software to handle it (free and open source).

Privately-owned companies, government agencies and ICT personalities
will take part in the convention: Lawrence Lessig (Stanford Law School),
Angelo Raffaele Meo (Polytechnic of Torino), Luciano Gallino, Alberto
Piazza and Marco Ricolfi (University of Torino), Alberto J. Cañas
(University of West Florida), Alberto Primo Braga (World Bank), European
Commission, Carlo Batini (University of Milano), Jean-Pierre Dardayrol
(CGTI), Georg Greve (Free Software Foundation), Leonardo Chiariglione
(Digital Media Project), Andrea Valboni (Microsoft Italia), Hellmuth
Broda (Sun Microsystems), Renato Peditto (IBM).

The programme and the registration form (to be filled by 19th October)
are available on the Web site <http://www.csi.it/opensource_eng>.

Thank you for your attention and for the diffusion of the event that you
would like to give,

Yours sincerely
