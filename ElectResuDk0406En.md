## Seat Distribution {#seat_distribution}

Denmark has 14 seats in the parliament. (previously 16)

In the last vote (september) the 5 liberal members voted pro-patent and
the one conservative didn\'t vote (personal reasons).

-   The liberals (pro-softwarepatent) have lost 2 mandates. (from 5 to
    3)
-   The \"june movement\" (against softwarepatents) have lost 2
    mandates. (from 3 to 1)
-   The socialdemocrats (not clear - takes a wait-and-see attitude) has
    gained 2 mandates. (from 3 to 5)
-   Social-liberals keep one MEP. Their MEP voted against swpat in
    September but new MEP this time.

## Frahm and Hindrup Missing {#frahm_and_hindrup_missing}

We have lost the two most prominent anti-softwarepatent members ([
Pernille Frahm](PernilleFrahmEn "wikilink") and [ Bent Hindrup
Andersen](BentHindrupAndersenEn "wikilink")). :(

Pernille Frahm has been replaced by Auken, who is also against
softwarepatents, but we do not yet know her commitment to actively work
for the case.

Bent Hindrup Andersen simply lost his mandate, which went to the
socialdemocrats.

## September 2003 vs Today {#september_2003_vs_today}

The result seems to be:

### 2003-09-24

-   pro-patent: 6 (but one didn\'t vote)
-   against: 10 (but one didn\'t vote)

### 2004-06-13 {#section_1}

-   pro-patent: 4 (3 liberals and 1 conservative)
-   don\'t know: 5 (4 social democrats and 1 socialliberal)
-   against: 5 (the rest)

It seem that much depends on if we\'re able to enlighten the \"don\'t
know\" group.

One important result of the election campaign is that there were
candidates with a clear anti-softwarepatent stand in all parties - also
the pro-patent parties. Although among these, only the social democrat
made it into the parliament, the enlightenment process may have helped
elsewhere as well.
