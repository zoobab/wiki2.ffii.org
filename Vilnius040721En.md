[Invitation](http://www.akl.lt/projektai/?doc=seminarai.html#SEC4 "wikilink") -
Lithuanian Parliament, 1st building, Constitution hall (III floor).
[Gedimino pr. 53, 01109
Vilnius-2](http://www.akl.lt/naujienos/#naujiena_255 "wikilink")

On their [ Baltic tour](RmsBalt0407En "wikilink"), Richard Stallman
(FSF), Christian Engström (FFII Sweden) and Marco Schulze (FFII Germany)
presented views on the software patent issue in the Lithuanian
Parliament. The audience included the Chairman of the Technology
Committee Gintautas Babravicius and several MPs.

### 1st speech - Christian Engström: What has happened in the EU about this so far {#st_speech___christian_engström_what_has_happened_in_the_eu_about_this_so_far}

Christian Engström began a layout of the directive, that albeit it
\"looks incredible boring\" directly affects both free and commercial
software. \"It was quite successful to just talk about it\" in the
European Parliament, this \"did make the directive come to line with its
stated objectives\". But during the Irish Presidency, the pendulum swung
back, and the text from the vote in the [ Council of the European
Union](Cons040518En "wikilink") was would make software patentable.

However, \"It appears \... some of the delegates thought they were
voting for one thing, but in fact voted for another\", he considers it
possible that the council still change votes. Later there will be [
another reading in the Parliament](EuroparlSwpat04En "wikilink").

### 2nd Speech - Richard Stallman: The danger of software patents {#nd_speech___richard_stallman_the_danger_of_software_patents}

The talk Richard gave was based on a [he presented
talk](http://ifso.ie/downloads/downloads.html#rms0 "wikilink") on [May
25](http://irish.typepad.com/irisheyes/2004/05/richard_stallma_1.html "wikilink")
at the University of Dublin in the Trinity College, which in turn was
based on a speech called [\"Software patents: Obstacles to Software
patents\"](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/stallman-patents.html "wikilink")
which he gave a University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory from 2002.
Some of the ideas are also found in [a publication from Eben
Moglen](http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/lu-05.html "wikilink")
from 2000.

Richard Stallman explained the ridicolousness of talking about IPR
pointing the difference between patents and copyright, different laws
that have little in common: *\"Suppose somebody developing a fluid
policy, encompassing say blood, milk, water, mercury\... This is
ridiculous. But the term \'intellectual property\' is a similar common
minglement of totally different things. Copyright on a mathematics books
does not hinder others from writing mathematics books. Patents however
are \"absolute monopolies on the idea\". The \"patent system has become
a time-consuming lottery -* [I\'m quoting the
\'Economist\'](http://gibuskro.lautre.net/patents/slide13-0.html "wikilink")\".

*The publicity for the patent systems comes from people with a vested
interest in the system, such as a lottery - the advertisement is the
same (people employed by the patent system). But from the victims
perspective, it is difficult to avoid patent infringement. E.g. \"The
compress program was released in 1984, at that time no patent in the US,
the author read about the alogorithm in an article\", a patent was
granted in 1985 and only after several years Unisys tried to enforce. It
was doable to substitute compress with gzip but it has been impossible
with GIF because the user base had accustomed to GIF like \"a language
they learned\". Same story nowadays with JPEG and MP3.*

This speech is not completely identical to the transcription linked
above, he added some meanwhile:

*The MPEG standard video is covered by 39 patents. It\'s very hard to
avoid patents.*

*30000 software patents in Europe are not labeled as such, because the
treaty (EPC) forbids the patenting of software.*

### 3rd speech - Marco Schulze: Economic Effects of Software Patents {#rd_speech___marco_schulze_economic_effects_of_software_patents}

Marco Schulze showed in his presentation, that there are much worse
effects by software patents onto the economy as one may think on the
first view. Many people still think, they are not affected by the
directive about \"computer implemented inventions\", because they don\'t
use software. Mr. Schulze made clear, that they have to pay for it
anyway:

Software patents cause not only an expensive overhead of patent
attorneys, but endanger even the existence of many
[SMEs](SMEs "wikilink"). This is because of the high costs of law suits
and the unevitable risk of unintended patent infringement. Many of these
and other swpat-related factors lead to higher software prices which
affect every company in our modern computerized society. These
additional costs follow the business chain until the end customer has to
pay the sum of all - whether he has a computer or not is irrelevant.

## Audio recording {#audio_recording}

An audio recording with all these speaches is available here:

These audio recordings also contain the full question and answer
sessions after the speeches, you normally don\'t get these from the
speech transcriptions, therefore it can be of benefit to listen to them.

During the next days, Riga, Tallinn and Helsinki are on the [
schedule](RmsBalt0407En "wikilink").
